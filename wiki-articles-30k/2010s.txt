   The 2010s (pronounced "twenty-tens" or "two thousand (and) tens") is a decade in the Gregorian calendar. It began on January 1, 2010 and will end on December 31, 2019.  Two pronunciations are used to mention specific years of the 21st century in English. For example, 2016 is either pronounced "twenty-sixteen" or "two thousand (and) sixteen".  The 2010s began amidst a global financial crisis that started in the late 2000s. In particular, the Eurozone debt crisis, which began during 2009, continued into the 2010s. Despite the crisis, the American Dow Jones Industrial Average had its longest stretch of gains since the late 1990s tech boom."When were the most prolific bull and bear market periods in the United States?" Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 2001. Web. 6 Jan. 2015. However, economic issues, including inflation and an increase in commodity prices, sparked unrest in many lower-income countries. In some countries, particularly those in the Arab world, political unrest evolved into socioeconomic crises. This set off numerous revolutions, including those in Kyrgyzstan and Tunisia in 2010, and Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Egypt in 2011 and 2012. This trend is commonly known as the Arab Spring.  The prominent wars of the decade include:  The most prominent coups d'état committed against the ruling governments during the decade include:  The most prominent terrorist attacks committed against civilian populations during the decade include: The prominent political events include: Note: State leaders in bold have led their respective states throughout this decades' entirety, without interruption, as of  . 125px" heights="125px" perrow="7 (TEMPLATE) Barack Obama (TEMPLATE) Vladimir Putin (TEMPLATE) Xi Jinping (TEMPLATE) Angela Merkel (TEMPLATE) David Cameron (TEMPLATE) François Hollande (TEMPLATE) Pope Francis (TEMPLATE) Cristiez de Kirchner (Mauricio Macri  Kevin Rudd (TEMPLAa Gillard (TTony Abbott (TEMPLATE) Malcolm  (TEMPLATE) Dilma Rousseff (TEMPLATE) Stephen Harper (TEMPLATE) rudeau (TEMichelle Bachelet (TEMPLATE) Sebera (TEMPLATE) tro (TEMPLel Fattah el-Sisi (TEMPLATE) Alexis Tsipras (TEMPLATE) bán (TJoko Widodo EMPLATE) Manmohan Singh (TEMPLendra Modi ATE) Mahmoud Ahmadinejad LATE) Hassan Rouhani (TEMPLATE) Benjamin Netanyahu(TEMPLATE) Matteo (TEMPLATE) be ATE) Kim Jong-un (TEMPLATE) Park Geun-hye (TEMPLATE) Najib Razak (TEMPLATE) Enrique Peña Nieto (TEMPLATE) Thein Sein (TEMPLATE) Benigno Aquino (TEMPLATE) Pedro Passos Coelho TEMPLATE) António Costa (TEMPLATE) Lee g (TEMPLATE) Mariano Rajoy (TEMPLATE) Bashar al-Assad (TEMPLATE) Ma Ying-jeou(TEMPLATE) Recep Tayyip (TEPrayut Chan-o-cha (TEMPLATE) Nuro EMPLATE) Nguyễn Tấn Dũng (TEMPLATE) Nguyen Phu Trong (TEMPLATE) Jacob Zuma (TEMPLATE) Mahmoud Abbas (TEMPLATE) Viktor Yanuko(TEMPLATE) Petrko (TEMPLAT Borissov ) Aleksandar Vučić (TEMPLATE) Pope Benedict XVI   Prominent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include: The most prominent disasters include:      In the United States, a Gallup poll in 2011 found that more than half of Americans believed the country was still in a recession.  Global oil production in 2014 reached an historic peak, reaching 93 million barrels/day. A sovereign-debt crisis in Europe began in early 2010, and the Greek government admitted that it was having difficulties servicing its large sovereign debt. In the summer and fall of 2011 bond yields for Italy and Spain spiked above 6 percent. By 2015 bond rates had returned to normal ranges across Europe, save for Greece, which accepted another, even more stringent bailout package. The size of the European Financial Stability Facility was increased from €440 billion to €2 trillion. China became the second largest global economy, surpassing Japan. In August 2011, the S&P downgraded the United States' credit rating from triple AAA to AA-plus. Japan also saw a rating downgrade due to debt burden.  Many countries reported declining fertility rates in their 2010 censuses. Young people now spent their entire lives in the context of online interactive technology. The 2010s are the decade in which most baby boomers in developed nations are to retire, putting pressure on pension programs and other safety net programs. The consequences of an aging society were felt hardest in Europe, Russia and Japan, which were the first to experience substantial population decline. Over 20% of Japan's population is over the age of 65, making it the most elderly nation. As a result, Japan examined alternative solutions for elder care, including robots. In the United States, proposals for revising Medicare and Social Security proliferated, including raising the age of retirement or adjusting benefit amounts. Opponents instead wanted to increase benefit levels.Montopoli, Brian. "John Boehner: Raise Social Security Retirement Age to 70 – Political Hotsheet." CBS News. 10 November 2011. In 2010, France debated and raised the retirement age to 60 from 62, despite widespread demonstrations in opposition. A few years later the threshold was lowered back to 60. Political polarization increased as conservatives and progressives clashed over the role of government and other social, economic and environmental issues. US polls showed a divided electorate regarding job creation, debt reduction and taxation.Jamrisko, Michelle. "Political polarization affects economic views." Salon.com. Associated Press, 2013. Web. 7 Jan. 2015. Street movements protesting the increasing numbers of refugees from Islamic nations have developed, such as the English Defence League and Pegida. Acceptance of LGBT people slowly increased."Growing Support for Gay Marriage: Changed Minds and Changing Demographics." Pew Research Center, 2013. Web. 7 Jan. 2015. In June 2011 the United Nations passed its first motion in support of LGBT rights. Although many nations allowed gays to serve in their militaries, a major milestone came in September 2011 when the US abolished its "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. Marriage for same-sex couples was an ongoing debate in many nations, while over eighteen nations legalized same-sex marriage. Ireland, in 2015, became the first nation to legalize same-sex marriage via referendum. In 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that criminalized expression of homosexuality.[ ]  Prior to its passage, St. Petersburg drafted its own ban on homosexual expression, and banned pride events as well. In 2013, Baauer's "Harlem Shake" was the first Internet meme song to reach the #1 spot on the Billboard Top 100, reflecting a shift in popular culture as Internet memes became mainstream. The youth of the 2010s were called the "best-behaved generation on record." In May 2014, the US Centers for Disease Control released a report stating that teenage pregnancies and their uses of drugs and alcohol reached record lows.Today's teenagers are the best-behaved generation on record Vox A 2013 survey  showed that the rate of teen smoking dropped to 15.7%, the rate of teenagers having underage sex dropped to 34% and the rate of teenagers participating in a physical fight dropped to 25%, much lower than their counterparts 22 years earlier. E-cigarette and other smokeless tobacco product use among teenagers rose. One controversial trend was the rise of Social Justice culture among millennials and post-millennials. This culture drew media attention due to controversies such as GamerGate, in which Social Justice-focused internet communities and bloggers reacted to perceived misogyny on behalf of video gamers and gamer culture. These bloggers and movements have at times been denigrated as  "Social Justice Warriors" who take political correctness to extremes. This controversy manifested itself on college campuses, such as the University of Missouri protests in late 2015. New urbanism and urban revival influenced urban planning in the United States and other developed countries. However,  growth of American suburbs still outpaces urban growth. Environmentalism gained, though action on curbing fossil fuels has been limited. China was increasingly called a superpower in the early 2010s, including at the 2011 meeting between Hu Jintao and Barack Obama. China overtook the US as the world's largest trading nation, filing the most patents, expanding its military, landing its lunar rover Yutu on the moon, ending the nearly four-decade malaise of moon exploration and creating China's Oriental Movie Metropolis as a major film and cultural center. China was projected to have the world's largest economy by 2018 with an estimated GDP per capita equal to the US by the late 2050s.[ ]  In America, migration declined to its lowest level since tracking began in 1948. AIDS, a pandemic responsible for killing over 30 million people since its discovery in the early 1980s, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, became a treatable condition, though only one case had been cured. With good treatment patients can generally expect normal lives and lifespans. However,  only some 5 million of the 12 million afflicted have access to such treatment.   These are the 10 most significant scientific researchs by year based on the annual award Breakthrough of the Year made by the AAAS journal, Science.  180px" heights="120px Federal District buildings at the Zócalo in Mexico City decorated for the 2010 celebrations as seen from rooftop restaurant of Hotel Majestic. 2010 Copiapó mining accident Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton Queen Elizabeth II arriving at St Paul's Cathedral for the service of thanksgiving on 5 June 2012 Pope Francis appears to the public for the first time as pope Canonization of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II Republican demonstration in the Puerta del Sol on the day that Juan Carlos announced his decision to abdicate An Iglesia ni Cristo event being held at an arena in Bulacan, Philippines Aerial shot of Rizal Park, Manila, Philippines during the public Mass, January 18, 2015.  Postmodernism and green design were common architectural themes. "Sustainable design " emphasized natural lighting, green/white roofs, better insulation and other cost-saving features. China and the Middle East led in large-scale development.Bad boy architects & China's new face|Home|chinadaily.com.cn In 2010, Dubai's Burj Khalifa became the tallest man-made structure ever built, standing at . One World Trade Center, completed in 2014, is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere at 1,776 feet.  The 2010s have been defined by a revival of interwar, austerity era, 1980s (2010–13), early 1990s and skater fashions. In the early 2010s, many late 2000s fashion trends remained popular, especially the indie pop and grunge look which largely draws upon 1960s Mod clothing combined with elements of 1970s garage rock and contemporary alternative fashion. Latin American teens and young adults, who began keeping up with general Western fashion more closely in the mid-1990s, proved to be more conservative Hipster subculture and the "Thrift Shop" look had a considerable impact upon mainstream fashion. Full-printed T-shirts with diverse patterns (cosmic, clouds, historic architecture, and tribal) trended. In many Western countries, the growing of a full beard became a popular trend among young males in the early-to-mid 2010s, with some suggesting this was due to the influence of the hipster subculture and the Movember campaign. In 2015 Excessivism emerged. Other "schools" with strange names included:: Altermodern, Cynical realism, Post-contemporary, Metamodernism, Pseudorealism, Remodernism, Stuckism, SuperflatSanduperstroke.  Movies and television struggled to maintain their position, as online viewing grew rapidly. Piracy was a major concern for the industry. In 2012 Viacom launched a US$1 billion lawsuit against YouTube for copyright infringement. In early 2012, the United States Congress began debating the SOPA and PIPA bills that were heavily lobbied by the entertainment industry. Cable providers saw a decline in subscriber numbers as cord cutters switched to lower cost online streaming services such as Hulu, Netflix and Amazon.com's Prime service. These non-cable, internet-based media streaming services even began producing their own programming. TV sets, such as the Samsung SmartTV, started offering online streaming via television. 3D films gained popularity, led by Avatar in late-2009. In 2010, Avatar became the first film to gross more than US$2 billion. Other 3D releases were also successful.James Cameron Says 3D Is Not A Fad, It’s A Renaissance | Rama's Screen The video game and television industries also released 3D content. Animated films in the 2010s remained predominately computer-generated. Older styles lost favor, although (2D) Anime remained popular. Traditionally animated television shows for children remained popular. In 2010, Toy Story 3 became the first animated film to gross more than US$1 billion worldwide. The American soap opera format lost popularity in favor of reality television and daytime talk shows. Long-lived but canceled shows All My Children and One Life to Live return in 2013 as online content. Prime-time television serials and Spanish-language telenovelas remain popular globally. In 2010, Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to receive the Academy Award for Best Director for the 2009 movie The Hurt Locker. Superhero and science fiction films became box office leaders. In 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens became the highest grossing film of US box office.  Academy Award for Best Picture winners Palme d'Or winners at the Cannes Film Festival César Award for Best Film winners Best films of the Sight & Sound annual poll EDM, synthpop, indie, and trap see mainstream success throughout the early to mid 2010s. R&B and hip-hop grew again around 2013. Digital music sales in 2012 topped CD sales. The use of Auto-Tune and talk box declined in the decade. Dance and pop music surged into the 2010s, with EDM achieving mass commercial success. In the early 2010s, dubstep and drumstep, originating in the United Kingdom, rose in popularity globally. Drumstep is continuing to grow in popularity along with drum and bass. It mirrors the electronic-leaning musical trends elsewhere, while hardstyle is becoming increasingly popular in Australia and North America, with music festivals such as Defqon 1, IQON and The sound of Q-dance. Streaming services such as Pandora Radio and Spotify became the preferred music delivery systems. Record of the Year Grammy Winners  In 2013 for the first time, the four nominees for the Best Musical Tony Award were all based on movies.   cloud gaming, stereoscopic 3D gaming, and ongoing improvements in graphics were some of the biggest trends. Video game sales declined in the early-2010s, most likely due to the effects of the Great Recession. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, released in late-2011, made over US$775 million in one-week, matching the highest grossing films. According to the Entertainment Software Association, the average age of a person who plays video games is 30.The Entertainment Software Association – Industry Facts The decade began dominated primarily by seventh generation consoles, such as Xbox 360, the PlayStation 3 and Wii. Games such as the Sims franchise and many of Blizzard's popular titles remained popular on PCs and expanded to other devices. The OnLive console was released in 2010 becoming the first massively produced cloud gaming-based gaming device. 2012 introduced the first console regarded to be in the eighth generation, the Wii U, followed in late 2013, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. They faced stiff competition from tablet and smartphones.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-19/nintendo-may-fail-to-replicate-wii-success-as-iphone-games-bloom.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Pavel | last=Alpeyev | title=Nintendo May Fail to Replicate Wii Success as IPhone Games Bloom | date=19 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/facebook-games-stats/|title=Facebook Gaming: 10 Facebook Games Stats – Digital Buzz Blog|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref>  The [[Nintendo 3DS]], released in early 2011 introduced a glasses-free interface for 3D.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Mike |url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/events/plugged-in/-nintendo-announces-new-3d-enabled-ds/1394787 |title=Nintendo announces new 3D-enabled DS |publisher=Videogames.yahoo.com |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref> The [[PlayStation Vita|2D PlayStation Vita]] was released in 2012.

(The United Nations applies this label to Islamist groups such as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al-Qaeda). In the US this campaign attempts to prevent such groups from posing a threat to the country and its allies (or, in the case of Russia's and China's wars on terror, a threat to internal targets), and to put an end to state sponsorship of terrorism. Major campaigns with this objective were launched by the United States, with support from NATO and other allies. Anti-terror campaigns are not specific to the United States and its close allies. China is engaged in an internally focused war on terror (largely in response to attacks launched by Uighur separatists), and Russia, as well as countries in Central Asia, have made counterterrorism a major policy focus. Variants of the term War on Terrorism are used internationally and are not specific to US campaigns. War in Afghanistan (2001–2014) – on October 7, 2001, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia and Canada intervened in Afghanistan seeking to oust the Taliban, destroy Al-Qaeda and find Osama bin Laden. Combat operations were declared over on December 28, 2014, though several thousand troops remain in the country to support Afghanistan's military. Iraq War (2003–2011) – on August 19, 2010, the last American combat brigade left Iraq after more than seven years. About 50,000 troops remained there through 2011, designated as "advise and assist brigades" assigned to non-combat operations – but retaining the ability to revert to combat operations as necessary. The war was declared formally over on December 15, 2011. Military Intervention against ISIL (2014–) – In response to rapid gains made in Iraq and Syria by the Islamic State (aka ISIS, ISIL and Daesh), a coalition including the United States, France, Turkey, Morocco, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Denmark and others launched airstrikes in support of the Iraqi Armed Forces and Kurdish fighters. Most Western coalition members are engaged only in Iraq, while most Middle Eastern members are engaged only in Syria. The United States, United Kingdom and Morocco are engaged in both. A separate campaign is waged by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its ally, the Lebanese Shi'a militant militia, Hezbollah. Military Intervention in Yemen (2015-) – The intervention began in response to requests for assistance from the internationally recognized but domestically contested Yemeni government, due to a Houthi offensive aimed at its provisional capital of Aden. Saudi Arabia and its allies launched airstrikes in Yemen against the Houthis and loyalists forces. Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War (2015-) – This intervention began in response to requests for assistance from the Syrian Government against militant groups including the al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda in the Levant), the Free Syrian Army, the Islamic State and the Army of Conquest.

Mexican Drug War (2006-) – an armed conflict fought between rival drug cartels and government forces in Mexico. Mexican drug cartels became more powerful after the demise of Colombia's Cali and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. They now dominate the wholesale illicit drug market in the United States. Arrests of key cartel leaders, particularly in the Tijuana and Gulf cartels, led to increasing violence as cartels fought for control of trafficking routes into the United States. War in North-West Pakistan (2004-) – an armed conflict between the Pakistani Armed Forces and Islamic militants made up of local tribesmen, the Taliban, and foreign Mujahideen (Holy Warriors). The conflict began in 2004 when tensions rooted in the Pakistan Army's search for al-Qaeda members in Pakistan's mountainous Waziristan area (in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas) escalated into armed resistance by local tribesmen. The violence has displaced 3.44 million civilians and more than 7,000 civilians have been killed. Shia insurgency in Yemen (2004–2010) – a civil war in the Sadaa Governorate of Yemen. It began after the Shia Zaidiyyah sect launched an uprising against the Yemeni government. The Yemeni government accused Iran of directing and financing the insurgency.Johnsen, Gregory.

The violence displaced thousands of people residing in Mogadishu, the nation's capital. 1,739 people in total were killed between January 1, 2009 until January 1, 2010.allafrica More Than 1,700 Killed in Clashes in 2009, 1 January 2010 Conflict in the Niger Delta (2004-) – a conflict in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The conflict arose from tensions between oil companies and Niger Delta minority ethnic groups who felt they were being exploited, particularly the Ogoni and the Ijaw. The competition for oil wealth has led to a cycle of violence between the local ethnic groups, causing the militarization of nearly the entire region that was occupied by militia groups as well as Nigerian military and the forces of the Nigerian Police. Civil war in Chad (2005–2010) – involved Chadian government forces and rebel groups. The government of Chad estimated in January 2006 that 614 Chadian citizens had been killed in cross-border raids. Insurgency in the Maghreb (2002-) – Algeria has been the subject of an Islamic insurgency waged by the Sunni Islamic Jihadist militant group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC). GSPC allied itself with the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb against the Algerian government. The conflict spread to other neighbouring countries. Colombian Armed Conflict (1964-) – President Juan Manuel Santos took office in 2010 and sought to continue Alvaro Uribe's policy about the conflict. The weakened FARC and ELN guerrillas began negotiating with the government. Paramilitary forces demobilized, but irregular drug-trafficking forces called "Bacrim" gained control over much of the areas that the AUC paramilitaries previously held. The "Bacrim" gangs have allied with guerrillas in some regions of the country such as Chocó and Antioquia. Northern Mali conflict (2012–2013) – a rebellion by Tuaregs in Northern Mali begun in January 2012. After Malian president Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted in a coup d'état, Tuaregs captured Northern Mali. In April 2012, the "Independent State of Azawad" was declared by the MLNA, a Tuareg organization. Islamist groups Ansar Dine, AQIM and MOJWA seized Northern Mali from the MLNA and imposed sharia law. France and various African states are helping the Malian military to recapture the area. Arab Spring (December 17, 2010-) – a revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests in the Arab world that began Friday, December 17, 2010. Protests began in Tunisia and Algeria. On January 14, 2011, the President of Tunisia, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, resigned after 23 years as President. On January 25, 2011, protests against President Hosni Mubarak began in Egypt. Mubarak resigned on February 11, 2011. Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood won the 2012 Egyptian presidential election. In November 2012, protests against Morsi began, intensifying in June 2013. On July 3, 2013, the Egyptian military ousted Morsi in a coup d'état. Post-coup violence in Egypt continued. Libyan Civil War (February 15-) – a series of demonstrations and riots held against Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule. Widespread demonstrations, which erupted in response to the high unemployment rate in Libya and the lack of development in the country, rapidly escalated into a civil war as Gaddafi used his military force against the Libyan rebels. As a result, fifty thousand Libyans have died. Gaddafi was killed during the Battle of Sirte on October 20, 2011. Protests started in other Arab countries, including Yemen, Jordan, Sudan and Saudi Arabia. Syrian Civil War (March 15, 2011-) – On March 15, 2011, protests against President Bashar al-Assad's rule began in Syria. In April 2011, the uprising intensified, and the Syrian Army was deployed by the government to quell the popular uprising. a series of demonstrations and riots held against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Opposition forces soon became more organized, eventually resulting in the formation of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). On July 15, 2012, the International Committee of the Red Cross declared the uprising to be a civil war. 2010 Nigerien coup d'état (February 18, 2010) 2011 Egyptian coup d'état (February 11, 2011) 2012 Malian coup d'état (March 22, 2012) 2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état (April 12, 2012) 2013 Egyptian coup d'état (July 3, 2013) 2014 Thai coup d'état (May 22, 2014) 2010 Moscow Metro bombings (40 killed) 10 May 2010 Iraq attacks (100+ killed) May 2010 attacks on Ahmadi mosques in Lahore (86 killed) Mohmand Agency attack (105 killed) September 2010 Quetta bombing (73+ killed) 2011 Domodedovo International Airport bombing (at least 35 people killed and 180 injured) 2011 Norway attacks (two separate attacks; 77 deaths) 2011 Monterrey casino attack (52 killed) Murder of Lee Rigby (first fatal al-Qaeda inspired attack in Britain since 2005) 2013 Boston Marathon bombings (3 killed and 264 injured) 2013 Cotabato City bombing (8 killed and 40 injured) Zamboanga City siege (200 killed and 70 injured) Westgate shopping mall attack (67 dead and 175 injured) December 2013 Volgograd bombings (34 killed and 85 injured) Islamic State of Iraq and Syria attacks (5 June-, 555 members killed) Bukidnon Bus Bombing (11 killed and 43 injured) 2014 Peshawar school massacre (145 killed and 114 injured) 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting in France (17 killed) 2015 Baga massacre (2,000 killed) Mamasapano clash (67 killed) Bardo National Museum attack (23 killed and 50 injured) 2015 Sana'a mosque bombings (137 killed and 351 injured) Makka al-Mukarama hotel attack (20 killed and 28 injured) Garissa University College attack (152 killed and 79 injured) ISIL Ramadan attacks (403 killed) 2015 Bangkok bombing (20 killed and 125 injured) Ankara bombings (102 killed and 400+ injured) November 2015 Paris attacks (130 killed and 368 injured) Bamako hotel attack (19 killed and 7 injured) San Bernardino attack (14 killed and 22 injured) 2016 Jakarta attacks (2 killed and 23 injured) In 2005, Iran's nuclear program became a source of tension due to fears that Iran could possibly divert civilian nuclear technology into a nuclear weapons program. This led the UN Security Council to impose sanctions against Iran on select companies linked to Iran's nuclear program, causing further economic isolation of Iran. In 2015, the US and Iran agreed to trade sanctions relief for explicit constraints on Iran's nuclear program, including permanently closing their plutonium reactor, shipping enriched uranium to Russia, reducing the number of uranium-enriching centrifuges by two-thirds and allowing some inspections of nuclear facilities. In January 2016 the US certified that Iran had complied with the agreement. Iranians convicted of sanctions violations were traded for imprisoned Americans as part of the certification. In April 2010, the United States and Russia signed a treaty in Prague to reduce the stockpiles of nuclear weapons in both nations. A week later, U.S. President Barack Obama hosted a Nuclear Security Summit where the attending nations decided to secure their nuclear arms to make sure no terrorists could access to weapons of mass destruction. During the 2013 Korean crisis, North Korea's actions suggested that North Korea might launch a nuclear attack against the United States, Japan or South Korea. In 2016, North Korea claimed to have tested a hydrogen bomb, although the US disputed this claim. Cyber security incidents (such as incidents of hacking, leaks or theft of sensitive information) gained increased attention of governments, corporations and individuals. WikiLeaks published three massive sets of documents pertaining to the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War and US diplomacy, among others. This affected legislation and regulations in multiple countries. Edward Snowden leaked files through the Guardian newspaper detailing NSA privacy policies, including PRISM, the NSA call database, and Boundless Informant. These leaks raised serious questions for civilians on whether their privacy should be breached in the name of public safety and whether that had already happened. Leaks also revealed covert actions against German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and have damaged diplomatic relations in Europe and Brazil. The Office of Personnel Management of the U.S. government was hacked, resulting in a massive data breach. The incident is currently under investigation by U.S. authorities. January 2010 – A trial to determine the constitutionality of same-sex marriage in the United States was held in California. March 2010 – The House of Representatives approved the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. October 2010 – Dilma Rousseff is elected as the first female President of Brazil. November 2010 – The Republican Party won control of the U.S. House of Representatives and a majority of the nation's governorships. September 17, 2011 – Hundreds of protesters marched into the financial district of Wall Street in New York City beginning the Occupy Wall Street movement.
