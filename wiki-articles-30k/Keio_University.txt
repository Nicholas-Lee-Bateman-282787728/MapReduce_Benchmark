Uni.international.mext.go.jp. Retrieved on 2014-06-17. In the United States, Keio has a high school called "Keio Academy of New York".   Keio traces its history to 1858 when Fukuzawa Yukichi, who had studied the Western educational system at Brown University in the United States, started to teach Dutch while he was a guest of the Okudaira family. In 1868 he changed the name of the school to Keio Gijuku and devoted all his time to education.  While Keiō's initial identity was that of a private school of Western studies, it expanded and established its first university faculty in 1890, and became known as a leading institute in Japanese higher education. It was the first Japanese university to reach its 150th anniversary, celebrating this anniversary in 2008. In 2009, Keio University was selected as one of "Global 30" universities, a government program "which is aimed at elevating... international competitiveness among the world's top universities and at creating an attractive environment for overseas students, while fostering students and researchers capable of playing active international roles." Keio has leading research centers. It has approximately 30 Research Centers located on its five main campuses and at other facilities for advanced research in Japan Keio University has joined the MIT and the French INRIA in hosting the international W3C. Fukuzawa stated the mission of Keio shown below, which is based on his speech at the alumni party on November 1 in 1896. Keio Gijuku shouldn't be satisfied with being just one educational institution. Its mission is expected to be a model of the nobility of intelligence and virtue, to make clear how it can be applied to its family, society, and nation, and to take an actual action of this statement. It expects all students being leaders in society by the practice of this mission. Those sentences were given to students as his will, and considered as the simple expression of Keio's actual mission. Keio is known for being the first institution to introduce many modern education systems in Japan. The followings are the examples. Keio put "" as a foundation of its education. This is meant to be physically and mentally independent, and respect yourself for keeping your virtue. Independence and self-respect are also regarded as Fukuzawa's nature and essence of his education.In fact, this phrase was also used for his Dharma name, which is a given name when people are dead, representing their nature.  is the other unique culture in Keio. During the late Edo period and the early Meiji period, several private prep schools often used students as assistant teachers and it was called "Learning half and teaching half". Keio also had initially used this system. In the early period of such schools of Western studies, there had been many things to learn not only for students but also professors themselves. Hence there had been sometimes the occasions that students who had learned in advance had taught other students and even professors. After the proper legal systems for education had been set up, those situations have disappeared. However, Fukuzawa thought the essence of academia was and is a continuous learning, and knowing more things provides more learning opportunities. Keio respects his thought and put the rule in "" that there shouldn't be any hierarchy between teachers and learners, and all of the people in Keio Gijuku are in the same company. For this reason, there is still a culture in this university that all professors and lecturers are officially called with the honorific of "Kun" but never "Teacher" or "Professor".Japanese people usually use "Kun" only between friends. This expression is normally considered as an informal expression and shouldn't be used for professors.Keio only use the honorific of "Teacher" or "Professors" officially when they refer Fukuzawa's name.  is also a uniqueness of Keio. Fukuzawa stated in 1879 that the Keio's success today is because of the collaboration in its company, and "Collaboration in a company" originally came from this article. People in Keio often think that all of the people related to Keio (e.g. professors, students, alumni and their family members) are the part of their company, thus they should try to help each other like brothers and sisters. This culture has been often seen especially in the alumni organization called .     was established in 1858 as a  located in one of the  in Tsukiji by the founder Fukuzawa Yukichi. Its root is considered as the Han school for Kokugaku studies named  established in 1796.Although Shinshu Kan didn't have a direct relation to Keio, Many people who studied or managed there were involved with Keio later. In fact, all students from Nakatsu Domain moved to Keio when it was closed. Keio changed its name as "Keio Gijuku" in 1868, which came from the era name "Keio"1868 is 4th year of Keio and "Gijuku" as the translation of Public school. It moved to the current location in 1871, established the  in 1873, and the official university department with Economics, Law and Literacy study in 1890.Although Keio had been already involved to the higher education, it had not had a university system before 1890. It was authorized by Japanese government as a university in 1920. Keio has been forming its structure in the following chronological order.See  for detail There have been several notable things in Keio's over 150-year history as shown below. Since the president system was established in 1881, there have been 18 presidents in Keio's history. In 2011, there are 33,825 students in Keio University, with 28,931 undergraduate students and 4,894 graduate students. Although two third of student body are male students, this ratio highly depends on the major (63% of students are female in the Faculty of letters, for instance). There are 1072 international students in May 2011, with 438 undergraduate students (1.5% of total undergraduate students), 480 graduate students (9.8% of total graduate students) and 90 students in the exchange program. Korea is the country which provides the most number of international students with 381 students, followed by China (300), Taiwan (57), France (42), Indonesia (27), USA (27) and Germany (22). In Japanese universities, there are student societies called "circles". Although the exact number is not clear, there are over 410 circles in Keio. Keio holds school festivals every year in each campus. The main festival is called "" on Mita campus, which is usually held in late November."Sai" means festival Mita Sai includes various activities for not only entertainment but also academic purposes. It is also a research workshop for students on Mita campus.See  Approximately 200,000 people visit Mita Sai every year. Edward Bramwell Clarke and Tanaka Ginnosuke first introduced Rugby union to Japanese students at Keio University. (The game had been played in the treaty ports of Yokohama and Kobe before that, but not between Japanese teams.) The interest of Keio's students in baseball stretches back to the early years of the 20th century; and the history of exhibition games was reported internationally. In 1913, an American professional team made of players from the New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox played the Keio team in an exhibition game. In a 1932 exhibition game, the Keio team beat the University of Michigan team which was then touring Japan. Keio's baseball team plays in the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League (six prominent universities in the Tokyo area).  Traditionally, there has been a strong rivalry between Keio and Waseda University. There are annually many matches between 2 universities in several sports, such as baseball, regatta and rugby. These games are called "Kei-So Sen(慶早戦)", or more generally "So-Kei Sen()". The Kei-So baseball game is especially famous because of its over 100-year history and importance in Japanese baseball history. The most famous Kei-So baseball match was held on 1943/10/16, and it was made into a movie titled "" in 2008. There are 2 Kei-So baseball game seasons every year and they are usually broadcast by NHK. There is no lecture on all campuses in Keio on the game day because of the students who want to watch this match. Japanese emperors visited Kei-So baseball games 3 times in 1929,1950 and 1994. Keio and Waseda have been often compared to each other in other general topics, such as their popularity and alumni's successes.

Year !! University development 1858 Keio Gijuku was established 1879 It rejected an offer to become a national university.In the beginning of Meiji period, there was a sense of ethics that Samurai shouldn't work for more than one master. Keio was established by the fund of Tokugawa Shogunate, so it was hard to work for the new government in this sense. Fukuzawa in fact criticized severely Kaishū Katsu and Takeaki Enomoto who worked for both Tokugawa and the new government (see ). His such strict viewpoint had prevented Keio to set up a political department, and kept many Keio graduate away from politics for a long time. It is also one of the clear difference from Waseda which has been positively involved to politics for a long time. Instead of that, it became a vocational school funded by Daimyos including Shimazu clan. 1890 University department with Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Law, and Faculty of Letters was set up 1906 Graduate school was set up 1917 School of Medicine was set up 1920 It was authorized as a 1944 Faculty of Technology was set up 1949 It was authorized as a 1957 Faculty of Business and Commerce was set up 1962 Graduate School of Business Administration was set up 1981 Faculty of Science and Technology (reformed from Faculty of Technology) was set up 1990 Faculty of Environment and Information Studies and Faculty of Policy Management were set up 2001 Faculty of Nursing and Medical Care was set up 2004 Law School was set up 2008 Faculty of Pharmacy was set up 2008 Graduate School of Media Design was set up President Tenure President Tenure President Tenure 1. 1881–1887 7. 1933–1947 13. 1969–1973 2. 1887–1890 8. 1946–1947 14. 1973–1977 3. 1890–1897 9. 1947–1956 15. 1977–1993 4. 1898–1922 10. 1956–1960 16. 1993–2001 5.

Adrian David Cheok Graduate School of Media Design Mixed Reality Researcher in mixed reality, Young Global Leader in 2008 Keio is the earliest Japanese school that introduced an annual fixed course fee, designed by Fukuzawa.In the Edo Period, private schools normally collected money or properties with Noshi irregularly from students, but those fees highly depended on each student's economic circumstances. Fukuzawa thought such an unstable financial system prevented the modernization of educational institutions as well as professors' professionalism. Then he designed a rudimentary management system for the school's finances.[ ] It initially introduced the culture of speech to Japan, which Japan had never had before. It built Japan's earliest speech house  in 1875 as well.Before the Meiji Period, Japanese people had thought the oral statement is not reliable enough for decision making, thus every time people had needed to state their opinions on paper when they had needed to decide something. Fukuzawa thought this culture would seriously prevent to introduce the modern parliamentary regime and the fair court system. Then he developed the art of speech by the arrangement of Western speech. [ ] It is regarded as Japan's first university to accept international students. Keio accepted 2 Korean students in 1881 as its (and also Japan's) first international students. 60 Korean students entered in 1883 and 130 Korean students in 1895. Keio launched  as a first chancellor of the Imperial University (University of Tokyo) in 1886. He is the first chancellor of the officially authorized university in Japan. Keio sent 6 students to abroad in 1899. In the same year, it accepted three international students from India, Qing Dynasty China, and Thailand. Eight international students entered from Taiwan (which had technically been a territory of the Japanese Empire since 1895) in the next year. Keio was visited by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore where he made a speech in 1916. Keio was visited by Albert Einstein where he presented a lecture on the special theory of relativity in 1922. It started to accept female students in 1946.
