    Snellville is an affluent city in Gwinnett County, Georgia, United States, east of Atlanta.  The population was 18,242 at the 2010 census. In 1874 seventeen-year-old friends from London, England, Thomas Snell and James Sawyer, secretly planned a voyage to the New World. On March 18, James Sawyer and his brother, Charles Sawyer, left England but Snell’s parents, having learned of the plan, wouldn’t allow him to leave, thus delaying his departure. The Sawyer brothers arrived in New York on April 1 and, after a few weeks, headed towards Athens, Georgia and then to Madison County where they stayed and worked on a farm for $10 a month. Snell did eventually follow his friends to New York and made his way south to meet them. The three then made their way through Jefferson and Lawrenceville. Shortly after Snell’s arrival, Charles left for Pennsylvania, later returning to the south and settling in Alabama where he went into the turpentine business. James had gone also, in search of his brother, leaving Snell to work on the farm of A. A. Dyer. Unable to find his brother, James Sawyer returned to New York and began work on a farm near the Hudson River area until his 21st birthday in 1878 when he returned to England to claim his inheritance. Shortly following, in August 1879, he returned to Americus, Georgia and then Gwinnett County. Once in Gwinnett County Sawyer went to a small settlement near Stone Mountain then known as New London, where he found Snell. In the homestead that Snell now referred to as Snellville, the two built a small wood frame building and started a business together, Snell and Sawyer’s Store, similar to the one in which they were employed in London. As was common in small mill towns of the time, they printed store money with the trade value and Snell’s likeness on the front that regular customers could use to purchase goods. By the end of 1879 the business was prospering and catering to customers from the neighboring towns of Lawrenceville and Loganville. Travelers would buy supplies at "Snell and Sawyer’s" and often spend the night in the nearby oak groves, as the trip was too great for one day’s travel. It is uncertain when New London officially became Snellville, but the location of the partners’ store was referred to as Snellville in their advertising and the young town began to show a promising future. But the partnership dissolved and Sawyer kept the old store, building granite stone above and around the old frame and then disassembling the wood frame from within. Snell built a new store of granite. In 1883 Sawyer built a home and married Emma Webb, of the historic Snellville Webb family, on November 15. Sawyer opened Snellville’s first post office in 1885 and served as Postmaster from the back of his store. Snell died at the early age of 39 in 1896 due to complications following an appendicitis operation. He was buried in Brownlee Mountain, presently known as Nob Hill, and later removed and buried again in nearby Lithonia. Initially forced into partial retirement due to his failing eyesight, Sawyer went into full retirement in the 1940s following complete blindness. After that time the store was owned and operated by various merchants until it was destroyed in 1960 and a service station was built in its place.ames Sawyer died in 1948 at the age of 91 and is buried in the Baptist Cemetery (now Snellville Historical Cemetery). "History of Snellville", City of Snellville, February 2, 2016, The Snell family remains prominent in the Atlanta area today.  Another branch of the family is well established in the Houston, Texas area. The City of Snellville received their charter from the General Assembly of the State of Georgia (1923). The first mayor of Snellville was Gladston Snell and the first police officer was Byron Whitworth. In the late 1920s the charter went dormant and remained so for approximately 12 years before it was reorganized in 1940.  W. C. Britt acted as Mayor and George Martin and Crawford Juhan served as police officers. The city limits were enlarged to a  radius from the center of town. Following Britt’s term, the charter was again dormant until World War II, at which time Arthur Stancil became Mayor. The charter has since remained active.  Snellville’s growth remained slow until the 1960s when the suburban development patterns of segregated uses and automobile dependency became commonplace.  Present-day Snellville is quite a different place from the settlement that attracted James Sawyer and Thomas Snell.  According to the 2009 Census, Snellville’s population is 20,634 and includes 5,391 households.  Over 1,150 businesses operate in Snellville, bringing in more than $1&nbsp;billion in revenue yearly.  Snellville’s political system now includes a Mayor and 5 Council members.  There are over 100 employees working for the City of Snellville, which operates from five departments:  Administration; Parks & Recreation; Planning & Development; Public Safety; and Public Works.  The city limits have now grown to  and there are fourteen houses of worship located in the city limits. As of early 2011 new housing construction, much of it upscale, continues in Snellville and in areas of southern Gwinnett County carrying a Snellville address.  This is the only area of metro-Atlanta where this is occurring on such a large and consistent scale in blatant defiance of the recession.  The award winning and very upscale Governor's Walk neighborhood in Snellville went on to be completed after the recession was well underway.  Though many of the spec homes in Governors Walk went into repossession during the recession, all were bought and completed or are in the process of being completed as of January 2011.  Lake Norris has new upscale construction going on as of January 2011 with two new homes under construction and several major remodelings going on.  There is abundant new construction occurring along Centerville Highway SW as well as of January 2011. On a street called Norris Lake Way a collection of homes in the million dollar range continues to sell well as of 2011 as well making it one of the few area's of the metro where extremely upscale new construction is still selling well. Hightower Trail and other areas of southern Gwinnett County continue to see new construction as well.  New and finished resell homes in Governor's Walk and the Lake Norris area and on acreage in southern Gwinnett County continued to sell strongly during the recession often for very near pre-recession prices.  Georgia MLS statistics back this metro-Atlanta anomaly very strongly and many feel the areas good luck during the foreclosure crisis occurred because Snellville remained very strong economically during the recession and is a popular relocation area for locals of the metro-Atlanta area resettling from other suburban areas. The Snellville Loop (Snellville East-West Connector) concept was developed as a loop road connecting US 78 west of Snellville with GA SR 124 north of Snellville. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, this idea went through several iterations until it was developed into a route forming a complete north side loop (bypass) of Snellville, U.S. 78 west to U.S. 78 east. On November 9, 1992, the City of Snellville adopted a resolution opposing any loop road around Snellville. After the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) later put the connector onto their Statewide Construction Work Program, the City of Snellville passed another resolution (on August 23, 1993) opposing the proposed Snellville Connector. The Atlanta regional commission (ARC) then received a request from GDOT and the City of Snellville to conduct a study to identify the best transportation alternatives that are technically sound and supported by the local community. Recognizing the preferred alternative to be a major transportation improvement involving federal funds, ARC and its partners in the planning process designated the study as a Major Investment Study (MIS).    In early November 2000, then-mayor Brett Harrell began negotiating a land swap to transform an abandoned supermarket into a municipal complex and the now-former City Hall into part of a church campus. The old Kroger in the Oakland Village Shopping Center on U.S. 78 across from Snellville United Methodist Church and City Hall was just one of several dead or dying shopping centers plaguing Snellville. Abandoned big-box stores had become enough of an eyesore to make them a major issue in the 1999 city elections. Harrell had campaigned on a platform that included efforts to revitalize vacant retail space.Ippolitto, M. "Snellville may move City Hall; Mayor says deal with church to swap land for strip mall would allow reshaping city center.", The Atlanta Constitution, November 4, 2000, The project was not without its opponents. Among the concerned were tenants of the half-occupied Oakland Village Shopping Center that the city would take over and force the businesses to relocate.Hartstein, L. "Snellville council takes up land swap proposal; Church would buy shopping center, trade it to city for municipal complex site.", The Atlanta Constitution, November 28, 2000, The City Council voted unanimously in that November to proceed with the exploration of a potential land swap. There was concern that timing may become an issue and kill the deal in the early stages. The owner of the shopping center wanted to sell his property by the end of 2000 while the City Council decided to take no action for a six-month period. Some citizens expressed concerns of the project at the City Council meeting and asked for the deal to be put to a referendum.Hartstein, L. "Snellville land swap may falter; Timing at issue: Owner of shopping center seeks quick sale, but council wants six-month study.", The Atlanta Constitution, November 29, 2000, On March 5, 2001, the city held its first public hearing on the land swap. At the meeting over 100 citizens attended to support the idea while more than a dozen showed up to oppose it. A few cited a recent $79,000 roof job on the current city hall and the fact that the swap would benefit the church more than city as reasons to back out of the deal.Hartstein, L. "Snellville land swap gets mixed reaction; Proposal would benefit church", The Atlanta Constitution, March 6, 2001, On March 26, 2001, the City Council met to vote on the land swap proposal. At this meeting, the citizens were given a few specifics of the deal. According to the Council, the Oakland Village Shopping Center was worth $2,700,000 and the current City Hall was worth $2,300,000. Councilman Jerry Oberholtzer estimated that renovation of the shopping center for city use would be in the $2,500,000 range. He also estimated to renovate the current city hall for future needs would run the city the same cost. More opponents than supporters spoke at the meeting, a few senior citizens presented a petition against relocating their center which was part of the land swap plan. The City Council voted 3–1 in favor of the swap; Councilman Troy Carter was the only dissenting vote.Hartstein, L. "Snellville Council OKs land swap; Multipurpose town center planned for site", The Atlanta Constitution, March 27, 2001, As preparation for the swap began, the city hit a snag in June 2001 when it was revealed that there was a possibility of perchloroethylene soil contamination from an old dry cleaner site in the Oakland Village Shopping Center. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division responded that even in the event of contamination, a clean-up may not be required if no one lives close enough to the site or no one is using the ground water in the area. The city did discover the use of a well by a private citizen within a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) radius of the site.Hartstein, L. "Snellville land swap hits snag; EPD checking site for dry-cleaning solvents", The Atlanta Constitution, June 3, 2001, This citizen, Harold "Cotton" Willams, refused a $25,000 deal from the Methodist Church to cap the well. In response, the city began exploring a local ordinance banning the construction of new wells and closing any existing ones. The city council voted on June 25 to adopt the ordinance but still allow the use of the well for irrigation. The city council also decided to include the realignment of Oak Road and Henry Clower Boulevard at U.S. 78 in the land swap project.Hartstein, L. "Snellville Land Swap: His well leaves a big hole in closing city-church deal", The Atlanta Constitution, June 13, 2001,Hartstein, L. "Snellville's land swap apparently resolved; City limits use of water wells", The Atlanta Constitution, June 26, 2001, In July 2001 the land swap hit another snag. A lawyer representing the Nash Family of Snellville filed a lawsuit claiming the city could not trade one of the parcels because the city didn't own it. The Nash family contended it owned the approximately  tract and the unused building sitting on it. In 1935, Horace J. Nash deeded the building to the Georgia Rural Rehabilitation Corporation for use as a vocational center. The building was used to train unemployed workers during and after the Great Depression. Later, the city used the site for a jail, a senior center and an agricultural building. Most recently, the building housed Recorder's Court. Attorney Bill Crecelius said the Nash family had let Snellville use the building for decades without complaint. This issue was resolved when the city presented documents verifying its ownership of the title to the building as well as title insurance.Hartstein, L., Nurse, D., "POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Land swap hits new snag over ownership", The Atlanta Constitution, July 8, 2001, In July 2003, the last piece of a $6,700,000 building plan for the project fell into place. The Snellville City Council approved funding for a multipurpose complex combining municipal functions and police services, plus offering a public gathering spot. In a 4–2 vote, the council approved certificates of participation, a series of leases that are to be renewed annually until they are paid off in 20 years. The leases, with an interest rate of slightly more than 4 percent, will cost the city about $10&nbsp;million when they are paid off in two decades. Mayor Brett Harrell, Mayor Pro Tempore Melvin Everson and council members Jerry Oberholtzer and Deborah Rich voted for the funding program. Council members Robert Jenkins and Mike Smith cast dissenting votes. In the final plan, the land swap would include an  project encompassing a new City Hall, police department, senior center and public forum area.Davis, M., "Snellville gives the go-ahead for City Center", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, July 26, 2003, Groundbreaking for the new city hall began in March 2004 with the demolition of the Oakland Village Shopping Center. Hogan Construction Group of Norcross, Georgia, was awarded the $7,400,000 contract to construct both the new City Hall and new Senior Center. The original completion date was pushed back because of poor weather conditions. Crews also had to blast granite under the building foundation, further delaying the project and adding $200,000 to the cost.Burk, J., "Crews plan late summer opening for Snellville center", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 27, 2005, On March 12, 2006, the city officially dedicated the new city hall located at the corner of Oak Road and Main Street East (US 78). Mayor Jerry Oberholtzer was quoted say that arriving at the dedication day took "five years, four elections, three architectural firms and two lawsuits".Ghirardini, J., "Snellville City Center: Big day for new City Hall; After five-year journey, centerpiece makes debut", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 13, 2006, The city hopes to one day expand the complex by adding a parking deck and a new public safety annex.  On August 13, 2007, the City Council awarded a $52,000 contract to Smithco Construction of Gainesville, Georgia to demolish and remove the remaining piece of the old Oakland Village Shopping Center. The area has now been converted into an open green space. In January 2007, City Manager Jeff Timler informed the city council that they were in violation of his contract. The contract required the council to evaluate him that January and give him a cost-of-living raise and any merit raise deemed warranted. Council members Warren Auld, Bruce Garraway and Robert Jenkins did not submit their required evaluations on time.  The contract violation meant Timler was entitled to leave with half of his $87,000 salary in severance pay.Visser, S., "Snellville city manager may be on his way out", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 13, 2007, In 2004, the council voted to change the charter to create a council-manager form of government to prevent the abuses of previous administrations in the day-to-day functions of the city. Noted as popular and progressive, Snellville Mayor Jerry Oberholtzer accused the city council members of causing Timler's early departure with their overbearing micro-management of city staff. Councilmember Garraway rebutted that his micro-management was due to being "so hands-on" with his elected position.  By March 2007, Council members Auld, Garraway, Jenkins and Kelly Kautz had all submitted evaluations of dissatisfaction with Timler. They cited a lack of communication with Council members and deviations from their directives as reasons. Mayor Oberholtzer and Councilmember Barbara Bender had evaluated him with high marks. Councilmember Bender stated that Timler had kept her well informed through email that she noticed had been CC'd to the entire council. Councilmember Jenkins was quoted expressing his disapproval of the entire council-manager system by suggesting that a city with the size of Snellville (+/- 19,000) would benefit more with a hands-on council.Visser, S., "SNELLVILLE: City Council is 'out of control,' mayor claims", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 3, 2007, Timler was offered only his accrued sick and vacation time instead of the $43,500 severance package he cited in his contract. He subsequently rejected the council's offer. On March 12 a crowd of 50 citizens attended the City Council meeting to express their support of Timler as City Manager. At this time, the City Attorney, Thomas Mitchell, stated his legal opinion that the city was not in violation of Timler's contract.Osinski, B., "SNELLVILLE: City manager issue remains unresolved", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 13, 2007, By the end of March, Timler had submitted his letter of resignation with his last day on May 15. The council was given the option of retaining him on a transitional basis. Timler backed off his claims of "breach of contract" and accepted a severance package worth $56,000. Councilmember Jenkins accused Mayor Oberholtzer of using the city manager as a tool of politics by dragging Timler through the mud for political gain. Jenkins was one of the original three council members who first failed to submit an evaluation, and then eventually submitted one of dissatisfaction.Visser, S., "SNELLVILLE: City manager resigns, citing council interference", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 29, 2007, On May 14, 2007, the council met in a closed-door meeting to interview candidates for the city manager position on an interim basis. The council was unable to decide on a single candidate and Timler was retained on a temporary basis until the council could meet again.Smith, B., "SNELLVILLE: City Council delays hiring new manager", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 15, 2007, At a specially called meeting on Wednesday, May 16, the council approved the hiring of Macon-based consultant James (Jim) Brooks as interim city manager.Osinski, B., "SNELLVILLE: Consultant takes helm as interim manager", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 17, 2007, In February 2008, Jim Brook's contract with the city lapsed. Mayor Oberholtzer chose not to reappoint Brooks or to appoint any other candidate. On June 11, 2008, after a month-long search for a manager, the City Council unanimously approved the nomination of Russell G. Treadway of Elizabethton, TN for the position.Warren, B., "Snellville selects a new city manager", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 11, 2008, In February 2011, the City of Snellville hired engineering firm Clark, Patterson and Lee in conjunction with renowned urban planning firm Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company to begin the process of planning a new town center for the suburban community. A weekend long design charrette was held to engage the community in the process. The plan that emerged from this visioning process provides a new town green and shopping district, bordered by neighborhoods that incorporate a variety of housing types. The plan takes into account the Continuous Flow Intersection that had previously been planned by the Georgia Department of Transportation. A key element of the new town design is a system of bridges and tunnels that create a more walkable city.Anderson, J., "Snellville unveils plan for new town center", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 22, 2011, The City of Snellville operates under a Council-Manager form of government.  The City Manager is appointed by the Council and works with them on policy creation and then manages staff concerning implementation.  Comparing this form of government to a private business, the Mayor acts as Chairman of the Board and the City Council acts as the Board of Directors.  The City Manager under the direction of the City Council manages the day-to-day functions of the City.   The city's mayor, Tom Witts, was elected to a four-year term in 2015. Every two years, half of the elected council is up for election. In 2017, three City Council seats will be up for election. Unlike the county, state and national elections, where voting is done by Precinct, all city elections take place at City Hall.

Seven departure times are available in the morning and seven in the afternoon, Monday-Friday, via Stone Mountain Freeway (U.S. 78) to I-285 and I-20. The morning westbound route terminates at the Civic Center MARTA Station. The afternoon eastbound route terminates at the First Baptist Church of Snellville with a stop at the Hewatt Road Park&Ride. Buses first ran on the morning of April 2, 2007. In that first month, the route had a total of 1,783 riders. In May, there was a 40% increase to 2,520. On many mornings, the bus is standing room only.Osinski, B. "'A win-win situation'; Xpress a boon for commuters, environment", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 17, 2007, On August 21, 2007, the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners approved an agreement with GRTA to add five new Motor Coach Industries D4500CL buses to the route.AJC STAFF "More express buses bound for downtown Atlanta ", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, August 22, 2007, Snellville has one major hospital, Eastside Medical Center, formerly Emory Eastside Medical Center which serves the southern Gwinnett County Region.  Several suburbs competed for this facility. It is widely recognized as one of the best hospitals in the metro-Atlanta area. Snellville is located at  (33.858439, −84.006324). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.7&nbsp;square miles (25.1&nbsp;km²), of which, 9.7&nbsp;square miles (25.0&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.04&nbsp;square miles (0.1&nbsp;km²) of it (0.41%) is water. Snellville has a humid subtropical climate according to the Köppen classification, with generally hot, humid summers and mild winters by the standards of most of the U.S. Compared to most large cities around the world at approximately the same latitude (33°39'), such as Beirut, Lebanon; Casablanca, Morocco; Dallas, Texas; Los Angeles, California; and Phoenix, Arizona, Snellville has lower average winter temperatures. The primary reason for this is that the North American continent extends into high latitudes that allows systems to form and move eastward and southward without obstruction by major mountain ranges. Other factors include Snellville's distance from large bodies of water; its higher elevation, which can lead to rapid weather changes; prevailing wind patterns; and extensive tree cover, which reduces the urban heat island effect (an advantage during summer). In the winter, weather systems sweeping south from Canada, through the Midwest, bring temperatures that can reach below 25 °Fahrenheit (−3.9 °Celsius) a few times a year. The lowest temperature recorded in the city is −9&nbsp;°F (−22&nbsp;°C), reached on February 13, 1899. It also reached  twice and  once in Atlanta in the 1980s and 1990s. An average year sees frost on 48 days; snowfall, which occurs most years, averages 2&nbsp;inches (5 centimeters) annually. The greatest single accumulation of snow was 10&nbsp;inches (25 centimeters), on January 23, 1940. A more prominent issue in winter are the frequent ice storms that can cause more problems than snow; the most severe such storm may have occurred on January 7, 1973. Also during winter, warm air sometimes flows from the Gulf of Mexico, raising temperatures as high as 75&nbsp;°F (24&nbsp;°C). Though summers are humid, actual temperatures are lower than they may feel, with afternoon highs peaking at about 90&nbsp;°F (32&nbsp;°C) in late July. Temperatures rarely reach 100&nbsp;°F (38&nbsp;°C), which, during the last 30 years, was recorded in 1980, 1983, 1986, 1993, 1995, 2000, and 2007. The highest temperature recorded in the city is 105&nbsp;°F (40.6&nbsp;°C), reached on July 13 and 17, 1980. Like the rest of the Southeastern U.S., Atlanta experiences abundant rainfall, which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. Average annual rainfall is 50.5&nbsp;inches (127 centimeters); the only other major U.S. cities with greater rainfall are Miami, Florida, and New Orleans, Louisiana Thomas W. Briscoe Park consists of 87 developed acres (100 total acres), just south of the city center on Lenora Church Road.  The park hosts numerous activities for youth and seniors including summer camp, swim lessons, soccer and senior trips. Lenora Park and Disc Golf Course encompasses  of land on Lenora Church Road.
