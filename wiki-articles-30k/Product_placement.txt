   Product placement, brand integration or embedded marketing, is, according to the United States Government "any form of audio-visual commercial communication consisting of the inclusion of or reference to a product, a service or the trade mark thereof so that it is featured within a programme, in return for payment or for similar consideration". Product placement stands out as a marketing strategy because it is the most direct attempt to derive commercial benefit from "the context and environment within which the product is displayed or used"  The technique can be beneficial for viewers, since interruptive advertising removes them from the entertainment. In April 2006, Broadcasting & Cable reported, "Two thirds of advertisers employ 'branded entertainment'—product placement, brand integration—with the vast majority of that (80%) in commercial TV programming." said "Reasons for using in-show plugs varied from 'stronger emotional connection' to better dovetailing with relevant content, to targeting a specific group." According to PQ Media, a consulting firm that tracks alternative media spending, 2014 product placement expenditures were estimated at $10.58 billion, rising 13.6% year-over-year and global branded entertainment growth is now at $73.27 billion. The firm noted that brand marketers are seeking improved methods to engage younger audiences used to ad-skipping and on-demand media usage, and branded entertainment provides omnichannel possibilities to more effectively engage post-boomers, particularly Millennials and iGens.  A major growth driver is the increasing use of digital video recorders (DVR), which enable viewers to skip advertisements that interrupt a show. Product placement began in the nineteenth century. By the time Jules Verne published the adventure novel Around the World in Eighty Days (1873), his fame had led transport and shipping companies to lobby to be mentioned in the story. Whether Verne was actually paid to do so, however, remains unknown.William Butcher (translation and introduction). Around the World in Eighty Days, Oxford Worlds Classics, 1995, Introduction. With the arrival of photo-rich periodicals in the late 19th century, publishers found ways of lifting their paper's reputation by placing an actual copy of the magazine in photographs of prominent people. For example, the German magazine Die Woche in 1902 printed an article about a countess in her castle where she, in one of the photographs, held a copy of Die Woche in her hands.Die Woche, issue 40, October 4, 1902, page 1874 Product placement was a common feature of many of the earliest actualities and cinematic attractions that were the first ten years of cinema history.See especially Gurevitch, Leon. (2010). The Cinemas of Transactions: The exchangeable currency of GC attractions across audiovisual e Popular Narrative Media, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, Vol. 2 (2), 143-158. During the next four decades, Harrison's Reports frequently cited cases of on-screen brand-name products.Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews. Volume 1, page iii. He condemned the practice as harmful to movie theaters. Publisher P. S. Harrison’s editorials reflected his hostility towards product placement in films. An editorial in Harrison’s Reports criticized the collaboration between the Corona Typewriter company and First National Pictures when a Corona typewriter appeared in the film The Lost World (1925).Harrison's Reports. September 12, 1925, page 148. Harrison's Reports criticized several incidents of Corona typewriters appearing in mid-1920s films. Recognizable brand names appeared in movies from cinema's earliest history. Before films were even narrative forms in the sense that they are recognised today, industrial concerns funded the making of what film scholar Tom Gunning described as "cinematic attractions",For more detail on the Cinemas of Attractions see Tom Gunning's work: "The Cinema of Attractions: Early Film, Its Spectator and the Avant-Garde"; in Early Film ed. Thomas Elsaesser and Adam Barker (British Film Institute, 1989) short films of one or two minutes. In the first decade or so of film (1895–1907) audiences attended films as "fairground attractions" interesting for their then-amazing visual effects. This format was better suited to product placement than narrative cinema. Gurevitch argued that early cinematic attractions have more in common with television advertisements in the 1950s than they do with traditional films.See Gurevitch, Leon (2010) The Cinemas of Transactions: The Exchangeable Currency of CG Attractions, Journal of Television and New Media, Sage Publications, New York, 11 (5), 367-385 Gurevitch suggested that as a result, the relationship between cinema and advertising is intertwined, suggesting that cinema was in part the result of advertising and the economic advantage that it provided early film makers.Gurevitch, L. (2009). Problematic Dichotomies: Narrative and Spectacle in Film and Advertising Scholarship, Journal of Popular Narrative Media, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, Vol. 2 (2), 143-158. Segrave detailed the industries that advertised in these early films.Kerry Segrave. Product Placement in Hollywood Films: A History. McFarland, 2004. In the 1920s, Harrison's Reports published its first denunciation of that practice over  Red Crown gasoline appearance in The Garage (1920).Harrison's Reports. January 17, 1920, page 9. A feature film that has expectations of reaching millions of viewers attracts marketers.Wiles, Michael. (2009) The Worth of Product Placement in Successful Film In many cases no payment is made for product exposure and no promise of marketing support is made when consumer brands appear in movies. Film productions need props for scenes, so each movie’s property master, who is responsible for gathering props film, contacts product placement middlemen agencies or product companies directly. In addition to items for on-screen use, the product/service supplier might provide a production with large quantities of complementary products or services. Tapping product placement channels can be particularly valuable for movies when a vintage product is required—such as a sign or bottle—that is not readily available. One of the earliest examples is The Garage, a Buster Keaton/"Fatty" Arbuckle comedy which featured the logo of Red Crown gasoline in several scenes (although there is no definitive proof that this product placement was paid for). Fritz Lang's Dr. Mabuse the Gambler (1922) contained a prominent title card in the opening credits reading "The gowns of the female stars were designed by Vally Reinecke and made in the fashion studios of Flatow-Schädler und Mossner." Among notable silent films to feature product placement was Wings (1927), the first to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. It contained a plug for Hershey's chocolate. Fritz Lang's film M (released in 1931) includes features a banner display for Wrigley's PK Chewing Gum, for approximately 20–30 seconds. Another early example occurs in  Horse Feathers (1932), wherein Thelma Todd's character falls out of a canoe and into a river. She calls for a "life saver" and Groucho Marx tosses her a Life Savers candy. It's a Wonderful Life (1946) depicts a young boy with aspirations to be an explorer, displaying a prominent copy of National Geographic. In Love Happy (1949), Harpo cavorts on a rooftop among various billboards and at one point escapes from the villains on the old Mobil logo, the "Flying Red Horse". Harrison's Reports severely criticized this scene in its film reviewHarrison's Reports; October 8, 1949, page 162. and in a front-page editorial. In Gun Crazy (1949), the climactic crime is the payroll robbery of the Armour meat-packing plant, where a Bulova clock is prominently displayed. The Cannonball Run and Smokey and the Bandit film series featured conspicuous placements.  The film E.T. is often cited for its multiple, obvious placements. Cheerios and Coca-Cola had product placement in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Evita and in Superman: The Movie and the sequel Superman II. Clark Kent eats Cheerios for breakfast in Smallville. In Superman II's climax, Superman crashes into a giant Coca-Cola advertisement and saves a bus-full of people bearing an ad for Evita, before he smashes into a Marlboro delivery truck. Perhaps the ultimate example of product placement comes in the film Cast Away in which the Tom Hanks lead character is a FedEx employee.  References to the delivery company FedEx are in nearly every scene in the film, with the FedEx logo and name preposterously over-emphasized. In other early media, e.g., radio in the 1930s and 1940s and television in the 1950s, programs were often underwritten by companies. Soap operas were so-named because they were initially underwritten by consumer packaged goods companies such as Procter & Gamble or Unilever. When television began to displace radio, DuMont's Cavalcade of Stars television show was, in its era, notable for not relying on a sole sponsor. Sponsorship continues with programs being sponsored by major vendors such as Hallmark Cards. The conspicuous display of Studebaker motor vehicles in the television series Mr. Ed (1961–1966), which was sponsored by the Studebaker Corporation from 1961 to 1963, as well as the display of Ford vehicles on the series Hazel (1961–1966), which was sponsored by the Ford Motor Company from 1961 to 1965, are notable examples of television product placement. Placements fall into two categories: those that are donated to reduce production costs and those placed in exchange for compensation.ERMA.org, a Hollywood product placement association Lotz refers to two classifications within these two categories, what she refers to as "basic" and "advanced".  Basic placement is when the logo of an object or a brand name is visible but the characters don't draw attention to the brand.  Advanced placement is when the product or brand is mentioned by name by characters in the show or movie.Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) The Television Will Be Revolutionized. New York, NY: New York University Press. p. 167 Barter and service deals (mobile phones provided for crew use, for instance) are also common practices. Content providers may trade product placements for help funding advertisements tied-in with a film's release, a show's new season or other event.Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) The Television Will Be Revolutionized. New York, NY: New York University Press. p. 166-167 A variant of product placement is advertisement placement. In this case an advertisement for the product (rather than the product itself) is production. Examples include a Lucky Strike cigarette advertisement on a billboard or a truck with a milk advertisement on its trailer. Placing contemporary products into existing content creates new opportunities for marketers.Wayne Friedman and Jack Neff, "Eagle-Eye Marketers Find Right Spot, Right Time,Advertising Age, 1/22/01. Current product placements can be added to older programs when rerun or released on video.Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) The Television Will Be Revolutionized. New York, NY: New York University Press. p. 168-169Lubbell, Sam (January 2, 2006).  "Advertising's Twilight Zone: That Signpost Up Ahead May Be a Virtual Product". The New York Times.Cohen, Nancy (February 23, 2006).  "Virtual Product Placement Infiltrates TV, Film, Games".  E-Commerce Times. Examples include Numb3rs and Still Standing; where a scene may be originally shot with a blank table, with sponsored products digitally added, possibly for each airing.Jerry Cobb. (2006)  www.msnbc.msn.com Product placement goes digital, gets lucrative. NBC. As of 2007, dynamic or switchable placements became possible. Placements can be customized based upon factors such as demographics, psychographics or behavioral information about the consumer. In-game advertising vendors such as Massive Incorporated transmit user information to their servers, such as individual player IDs and data about what was on the screen and for how long, enabling user-specific placements.Kyllo, Blaine (September 1, 2005).  "Ads Get Piece of the Action".  The Georgia Straight. Hypervideo techniques can insert interactive elements into video. A variant of product placement is brand integration, which varies from placement when show "the product or company name becomes part of the show in such a way that it contributes to the narrative and creates an environment of brand awareness beyond that produced by advanced placement." While this type of advertising is common on unscripted shows such as The Apprentice, it can also be used in scripted television. An early example was by Abercrombie & Fitch, when one of its stores provided the notional venue for part of the romantic comedy film Man's Favorite Sport? (1964). On All My Children one character took a job at Revlon. The character's job became part of the character's development. Jurassic Park not only prominently features Ford cars and other commercial products, but also includes a scene displaying its own promotional merchandise. One shot shows the "Jurassic Park Souvenir Store", with products that it offered for sale to fans. According to Danny Boyle, director of film Slumdog Millionaire (2008), the makers used "product displacement" to accommodate sponsors such as Mercedes-Benz that refused to allow their products to be used in non-flattering settings. While Mercedes did not mind having a gangster driving their cars, they objected to their products being shown in a slum. The makers removed logos digitally in post-production, costing "tens of thousands of pounds". When such issues are brought up in advance of filming, production companies often resort to "greeking", the practice of simply covering logos with tape. Similarly, in The Blues Brothers (1980), portions of the defunct Dixie Square Mall in Harvey, Illinois, were reconstructed in façade and used as the scene of an indoor car chase. Signage belonging to mall tenants was replaced with that of other vendors; for instance, a Walgreens would become a Toys "R" Us."Dixie Square Mall History", pawflimworks.com (archived, 2006) Cars (2006) parodies NASCAR, an advertising-heavy sport which controversially had long allowed alcohol and tobacco sponsorships. NASCAR's sponsors were replaced with fictional or parody brands; Dinoco Oil takes pride of place, followed by a string of invented automotive aftermarket products positioned as pharmacy or medical brands. "Dale Earnhardt Inc." displaced "Junior #8"'s sponsor Budweiser to avoid advertising beer in a Disney feature. NASCAR's former "Winston Cup" trophy became the Piston Cup, removing a tobacco advertisement. Placements can be sound-only, visual-only or a combination of the two. The Russian television show дом-2 (phonetically Dom-2) (similar to Big Brother) often features participants stating something along the lines of, "Oh, did you check out the new product X by company Y yet?" after which the camera zooms in on the named product, explicitly combining an audio mention with a visual image. In The Real World/Road Rules Challenge participants often make a similar comment, usually pertaining to the mobile device and carrier for a text message. In 2010 Wal-Mart teamed with Procter & Gamble to produce Secrets of the Mountain and The Jensen Project, both family-oriented films that display the characters using Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble- branded products. The Jensen Project also featured a preview of Kinect. 20th Century Fox regularly uses their sister Fox News and Sky News channels in their films by including it as a plot device when characters view news broadcasts; which channel is featured in a film depends on its setting. The character typically stated that the audience is viewing Sky News. One example appears in the 1996 films Independence Day and Mission: Impossible. The pilot episode of the NBC sitcom 30 Rock featured the General Electric (at the time an 80% owner of NBC) Trivection oven,Trivection Oven on kitchencontraptions.com but was said to be a joke by the show's creator.On '30 Rock,' Tina Fey Draws From Her Past At 'SNL', Access Hollywood, October 10, 2006 The show later parodied placement. The 1988 film Return of the Killer Tomatoes mocked the concept—at one point, the film stops, for lack of money. The film's producer steps in, suggesting product placement as a way to continue. This was followed by several scenes with blatant product placement, including a Pepsi billboard installed in front of the villain's mansion. The film Fight Club, directed by David Fincher, bit the hand that fed it by depicting acts of violence against most of the products that paid to be placed in the film. Examples include the scene where the Apple Store is broken into, the scene in which Brad Pitt and Edward Norton smash the headlights of a new Volkswagen Beetle, and try to blow up a "popular coffee franchise", a thinly veiled dig at Starbucks. The film Superstar, starring Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon, shows every resident in town driving Volkswagen New Beetles, possibly for comic effect. Similarly, the film ''[[Mr. Deeds]]'' shows [[Adam Sandler]]'s character purchasing a [[Chevrolet Corvette]] for every resident of his town.  ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' showed Wayne and Garth decrying product placement while looking directly at the camera, holding up a product, smiling and sometimes giving a thumbs-up.  ''[[Kung Pow! Enter the Fist]]'' spoofed its product placements, highlighting the anachronistic inclusion of a [[Taco Bell]]. In a similar vein, in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back In Action]]'', the main characters stumble across a [[Wal-Mart]] while stranded in the middle of [[Death Valley]] and acquire supplies just for providing an endorsement. ''[[Kannagi: Crazy Shrine Maidens]]'' poked fun at its sponsor Sony by having one character give another a [[Blu-ray Disc]] with the tagline "It's a Sony", only for them to complain that they do not have a [[Blu-ray]] player, to which the character responds with a version in [[Betamax]].  === Faux placements ===  {{further|Fictional brands}}  ''[[X-Files]]'' (1993–2002) frequently featured the fictional Morley brand of cigarettes, the choice of the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]]. The company producing Morleys was also involved in a cover-up conspiracy, ''Brand X''.  [[Ghostbusters (film)|''Ghostbusters'']] had a faux product in the climax of the film when the team faces the [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]].  ''[[The Truman Show]]'' utilized faux placements to advance the narrative. The protagonist's wife places products in front of hidden cameras, even naming them in dialogue with her husband. This increases Truman's suspicions as he comes to realize his surroundings are intentionally fabricated.  Some filmmakers created fictional products that appear in multiple movies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Examples include [[Kevin Smith]] (Nails Cigarettes, [[Mooby the Golden Calf|Mooby Corporation]], Chewlees Gum, Discreeto Burritos) and [[Quentin Tarantino]] (Red Apple Cigarettes, Jack Rabbit Slim's Restaurants, [[Big Kahuna Burger]]).  This went even further with the fictional brand [[Binford Tools]] which appeared TV show [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Home Improvement'']] and in the movie franchise ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'', both starring [[Tim Allen]].  This practice is also fairly common in certain [[comics]], such as [[Svetlana Chmakova]]'s ''[[Dramacon]]'', which makes several product-placement-esque usages of "Pawky", (a modification of the name of the Japanese snack "[[Pocky]]", popular among [[anime]] and [[manga]] fans) or [[Naoko Takeuchi]]'s ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', which includes numerous references to the series ''[[Codename: Sailor V]]'', from which ''Sailor Moon'' was spun off.  This practice is also common in certain "reality-based" video games such as the [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], which feature fictitious stores such as Ammu-Nation, Vinyl Countdown, Gash (spoofing [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]]).

For instance, the league prohibits logos of sponsors painted onto the fields, although [[Gillette Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], has their stadium's logomark painted onto the [[FieldTurf]] field. In 2008, the league allowed sponsors on the practice jerseys of the uniforms, but not game uniforms.  In 1991, the league allowed uniform suppliers to display their logos on their NFL-related products. Since 2012, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] has been the league's official uniform supplier.  Two of the league's flagship teams—the [[Green Bay Packers]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]—early on adopted their identity from corporate sponsors. The Packers adopted the name "Packers" because they were sponsored by the [[Indian Packing Company]]. They later had "ACME PACKERS" written on their uniforms in the early 1920s after the Acme Packing Company bought Indian Packing. The Steelers adopted their current logo in 1962 as a product-placement deal with the [[American Iron and Steel Institute]], which owned the rights to the [[Steelmark]] logo. The Steelers later were allowed to add "-ers" to the Steelmark logo the following year so that they could own a [[trademark]] on the logo. (The Steelers' [[J.P. Rooneys|pre-NFL predecessors]] also regularly sold naming rights to companies in the Pittsburgh area.)  The league has placed itself.

Product placements are not allowed for products that cannot legally be advertised on television, including alcohol, baby milk, gambling products, medication or [[junk food]]. Placements are not allowed during children's, news, public affairs and religious programs. Additionally, broadcasters must disclose placements on-air by displaying a "PP" icon on-screen during the program for at least three seconds at the beginning, after every commercial break, and at the end.
