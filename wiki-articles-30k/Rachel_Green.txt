     Rachel Karen Green is a fictional character, one of the six main characters who appear in the American sitcom Friends. Portrayed by actress Jennifer Aniston, the character was created by show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and appeared in each of the show’s 236 episodes during its decade-long run, from its premiere on September 22, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. Introduced in the show's pilot as a naive runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend Monica and relocates to New York City, Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled, inexperienced daddy's girl into a successful businesswoman. During the show's second season, the character becomes romantically involved with her friend Ross, with whom she maintains a complicated on-again, off-again relationship throughout the entire series. Together the characters have a daughter, Emma. The role of Rachel was originally offered to actresses Téa Leoni, the producer's first choice, and Courteney Cox, both of whom declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth, and Cox in favor of playing Rachel's best friend Monica in Friends. A virtually unknown actress at the time who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned for the role of Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. After acquiring the role and before Friends aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, Muddling Through, at the time, which was ultimately canceled and allowed Aniston to remain on Friends. Critical reception towards Rachel has remained consistently positive throughout Friends decade-long run, with The A. V. Club attributing much of the show's early success to the character. However, some of her storylines have been criticized, specifically her romantic relationship with her friend Joey during season ten. Rachel's popularity established her as the show's breakout character, who has since been named one of the greatest television characters of all-time, while the character's second season haircut spawned an international phenomenon of its own. Named the "Rachel" after her, the character's shag continues to be imitated by millions of women around the world and remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history, in spite of Aniston's own resentment towards it. Rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s. Meanwhile, the character's relationship with Ross is often cited among television's most beloved. Rachel is considered to be Aniston's breakout role, credited with making her the show's most famous cast member and for spawning her successful film career. Praised for her performance as Rachel, Aniston won both an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series – Comedy Or Musical. Rachel debuts in the pilot episode of Friends as a runaway bride who is distraught after abandoning her fiancé Barry Farber (Mitchell Whitfield) at the altar. She locates her high school best friend Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), the only person she knows in New York City, who agrees to let Rachel reside with her while she attempts to reorganize her life. Rachel meets and befriends Monica’s friends Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), while reuniting with Monica's older brother Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), who has harbored unrequited romantic feelings for her since high school. Having previously relied on her parents' money her entire life with a sole goal of marrying wealthy, Rachel attempts to reinvent herself as an independent young woman by waitressing at Central Perk, a coffeehouse where her new friends regularly socialize. As season one concludes, Rachel finally confesses her love for Ross, having learned of his feelings for her from Chandler, only to find that he has already begun dating another woman, whom she resents. However, Ross eventually chooses Rachel over his girlfriend Julie (Lauren Tom), and the couple dates for the remainder of the second season. However, their relationship rapidly begins to deteriorate towards the end of the third season after Rachel quits her job at the coffeehouse in favor of working in fashion. While Rachel becomes increasingly preoccupied with her new job, Ross grows jealous of her companionship with her coworker Mark (Steven Eckholdt), ultimately culminating in their break up on their one-year anniversary following a series of heated arguments and disagreements. In the episodes following the break up, Rachel and Ross are initially hostile towards each other. The exes continue to harbor feelings for each other. During a beach house vacation with their friends, Rachel and Ross briefly reconcile when he ends his relationship with Bonnie (Christine Taylor), only to break up once again due to a disagreement. During season four, Rachel dates her customer Joshua (Tate Donovan), while Ross dates her boss' niece Emily (Helen Baxendale), to whom he eventually gets engaged. Competitively, Rachel proposes to recent divorcee Joshua, frightening him off. Rachel indirectly contributes to the demise of Ross and Emily's relationship when he accidentally utters Rachel's name while exchanging their wedding vows. Ross ultimately divorces a jealous Emily, choosing his friendship with Rachel instead. At the end of season five, Ross and Rachel drunkenly get married while vacationing with their friends in Las Vegas. In season six, their annulment request is denied because of Rachel having leveled unfounded allegations against Ross, forcing the two to file for a divorce instead. In season seven, Ross and Rachel unwittingly conceive a child when their birth control fails. Rachel gives birth to a girl in season eight, naming the baby Emma Geller-Green; the name Emma is a gift from Monica, who had previously been reserving the name for her own child. Rachel and Ross live together as non-romantic roommates during the first half of season nine. Rachel eventually finds a job opportunity in France, but has second thoughts when Ross eventually forfeits stubbornness and says "I love you". Rachel ultimately decides to stay and reignite her relationship with Ross, getting off the plane at the last minute. After their short-lived television series Family Album was canceled by CBS, writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman pitched Friends under its original title Insomnia Cafe to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield as a sitcom about "that special time in your life when your friends are your family," loosely basing the show on their own experiences as young people living in New York, while the characters were inspired by their own friends. According to the book Shining in the Shadows: Movie Stars of the 2000s by Murray Pomerance, the character of Rachel Green, originally named Rachel Robbins, was conceived as "someone who was not prepared to deal with the world as an adult." While critics and audiences initially perceived Monica as the show's main character when Friends premiered, Rachel was given the pilot's most prominent storyline. Observing that the show's main characters are each based on a stereotype, Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph identified Rachel as "the self-absorbed one who goes from riches to rags." Before deciding that Rachel and Ross would be an item for the entire series, the writers had originally intended for the show's defining couple to be Joey and Monica. However, after the success of the pilot – in which Rachel and Ross' developing romance is first hinted at – and witnessing Aniston and co-star David Schwimmer's on-screen chemistry for the first time, Crane and Kauffman realized that "the whole series hung on Ross and Rachel, and finding all the wonderful roadblocks for them to be with each other." Audiences rooted for Rachel and Ross' union since the very beginning of Friends, openly voicing their frustration with "Rachel’s inability to see what was right under her nose." The pivotal episode that would ultimately transform the two friends' relationship for the entire series was the season one finale "The One Where Rachel Finds Out", in which Rachel finally learns of Ross' feelings for her and discovers she feels the same. However, the episode nearly went unwritten because, at the time, few were expecting the couple's relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately was. The episode was first suggested by director James Burrows; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple's dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive "he's pining, she's oblivious" pattern, turning to the work of author Jane Austen for inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from Ross to Rachel. Because the stakes were high, "The One Where Rachel Finds Out" became Friends most edited and reworked episode at that time. The couple's first kiss at the end of season two's "The One Where Ross Finds Out" was met with "ear-shattering" applause from the studio audience. Crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging, and thus attempted to do so by "dangl[ing] the possibility of a Ross and Rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together." According to Encyclopedia of Television author Horace Newcomb, Ross and Rachel's ever-changing relationship "converted the traditional amnesic plotlines of the situation comedy into ones akin to episodic drama." Meanwhile, writing for The New York Review of Books, Elaine Blair agreed that Friends created "a sense of chemistry between two characters while also putting obstacles in their way, setting us up for a long-deferred union." After Rachel and Ross drunkenly get married while on vacation in Las Vegas during season five, Schwimmer had initially objected to the idea of having his character Ross divorce her – his third divorce – because he felt that it was taking it "too far." The actor explained that "The whole arc of the relationship was weird then ... because for [Ross] to be able to move on enough to marry someone else and then go back to being in love with Rachel later just went a bit too far." Rachel and Joey's romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay Ross and Rachel's reunion further. Crane felt that pairing Rachel and Joey during season ten "was for the greater good" because "It was inappropriate." However, the cast initially protested the idea, fearing that Rachel, Joey and Ross would ultimately become unlikeable characters and audiences would either "resent Joey for going after a pregnant woman, or resent Rachel for rejecting him, or resent Ross for standing between the two of them." Meanwhile, the writers also approached the concept of Rachel's pregnancy and baby tentatively, worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want Friends "to become a show about a baby" while "On the other hand, we don't want to pretend that there isn't one." According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, the critical success and popularity of Rachel's pregnancy is ultimately responsible for "propel[ling] the show to the top of the ratings". When it finally came time to write the series finale, "The only thing [Crane and Kauffman] absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get Ross and Rachel together," deciding, "We had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their 'will they or won’t they,' and we didn’t see any advantage in frustrating them" any longer. However, at one point the writers had deliberated ending the series with Ross and Rachel in "a gray area of where they aren’t together, but we hint there’s a sense that they might be down the road." Ultimately, Crane and Kauffman relented in favor of giving the audience what they want. The final character to be cast, Rachel is portrayed by actress Jennifer Aniston, who auditioned for the role after first declining a position as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. Her decision was initially ridiculed by both friends and actor Adam Sandler, a Saturday Night Live alum. Actress Téa Leoni, who at the time was being referred to as "the next Lucille Ball", was offered the role of Rachel as the studio's first choice, but she declined in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth. Actress Elizabeth Berkley also auditioned for Rachel prior to garnering a role on the teen sitcom Saved by the Bell. Other actresses who auditioned for the role include Denise Richards, Melissa Rivers, Nicolette Sheridan, Parker Posey and Jami Gertz. Originally, the Friends producers had wanted to cast actress Courteney Cox as Rachel, who Crane and Kauffman were particularly drawn to because she "had this cheery, upbeat energy." In addition to this, Cox was the most famous cast member at the time amidst an ensemble of relatively unknown actors. However, the actress lobbied in favor of playing the character of Rachel's best friend Monica, the role in which she was ultimately cast, because she felt that she was not "quirky" enough to play Rachel. At the same time, though unbeknownst to each other, Aniston was being considered for the role of Monica, but fought to play Rachel instead, feeling that the character suited her better. At one point, Cox had begun to regret her decision to play Monica until her own character started to receive stronger storylines. Friends was the sixth sitcom Aniston had starred in, each of her previous attempts having been unsuccessful and canceled prematurely. Feeling vulnerable after experiencing so many cancellations, Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career, who encouraged her to audition for Friends, which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time. Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this. However, casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because, at the time, Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through, in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years. CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract, which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously, traveling back-and-forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks. Meanwhile, NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel, replace Aniston and reshoot several episodes if CBS' series proved successful, which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars. However, Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail. Essentially, the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered, while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends. During this time of uncertainty, Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends-related promotions and photo shoots; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced. Aniston explained, "When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they didn't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel." Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position. The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part, while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her, "I'm auditioning for your part in Friends." Ultimately, Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes, two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired, thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show, becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25. Crane appreciated Aniston's interpretation of Rachel because "in the wrong hands Rachel is kind of annoying and spoiled and unlikable," commending the actress for "breathing life into a difficult character." Crane and Kauffman strongly envisioned Friends as an ensemble comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed the show as such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show's main characters are "of equal importance." As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because "utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines." Kauffman echoed "that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage." The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten – approximately $25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the "Rachel" and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress' popularity to boost the show's ratings, notably her character's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston had been telling the press that the show's ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season. She explained to NBC's Matt Lauer, "I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high. And then I was also feeling like, ‘How much more of Rachel do I have in me?’” However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston's busy film schedule. Rachel is the youngest of Friends six main characters. The term "spoiled" is often used to describe the character's personality during her early appearances. Encyclopaedia Britannica describes Rachel as a spoiled and funny character. According to Rachel's original character description, written by Crane and Kauffman themselves for the show's pilot, the character is a spoiled yet courageous young woman who "Has worked for none of what she has," unlike best friend Monica, and is initially "equipped to do nothing." James Endrst of the Hartford Courant identified her as "a spoiled rich kid," while the Daily News dubbed Rachel an "endearingly spoiled Daddy's girl." Author Kim Etingoff wrote about Rachel in her book Jennifer Aniston: From Friends to Films  that the character is "spunky and sometimes spoiled," while TV Land called her "naive." Citing the differences between Rachel and her two female friends, The Guardians Ryan Gilbey observed that the character "wasn't insulated by self-regard, like Monica, or swaddled in gormlessness, like Phoebe." Frequently identified as fitting the "girl next door" archetype, Anne Bilson of The Telegraph described Rachel as "funny but not too funny, pretty but not too pretty, sexy but not too sexy, scatterbrained but not too scatterbrained." TalkTalk's Dominic Wills described the character as "smart but ditzy, determined but undisciplined." Meanwhile, Liat Kornowski, writing for The Huffington Post, scribed that Rachel is a "beautiful, coveted, slightly neurotic, borderline egocentric" character. According to Reign Magazine, Rachel is "a human being full of vulnerability, humor and strength while aesthetically donning an undeniable beauty and allure." Originally depicted as a character who is unprepared for "the world as an adult," Rachel's personality was gradually tailored to suit Aniston as the series progressed, becoming "more self-sufficient and sympathetic." According to Shining in the Shadows: Movie Stars of the 2000s author Murray Pomerance, "The more boundary collapsed between the 'real' Jennifer Aniston and Rachel, the more 'authentic' Aniston became." Pomerance also noted that the character's "well-roundedness, normalcy and relatability" is similar to Aniston's, while both the character and the actress herself are very expressive, talking "with [their] hands a good deal." In her book How To Write For Television, author Madeline Dimaggio wrote that although "Rachel grew within the context of the series ... she would always struggle with the spoiled, image-conscious Daddy's girl who fled from her wedding in the pilot." Similarly, BuddyTV wrote that although Rachel "eventually evolves into being less absorbed in later series, she [remains] the most image-centric among the six," while Vogue's Edward Barsamian opined, "She might have been self-centered and bratty, but Rachel Green was perhaps the most stylish and unabashedly fashion-obsessed character on the show."<ref name=":33">{{cite web|url = http://www.vogue.com/10549635/jennifer-aniston-friends-fashion/|title = Friends Forever: What We Learned From Jennifer Aniston’s Cool ’90s Style|date = February 11, 2015|accessdate = April 10, 2015|website = Vogue|last = Barsamian|first = Edward}}</ref> TV Land summarized the character's arc and development in the website's biography of her, writing, "Rachel is a born shopper, but… she’s not necessarily a born worker.
