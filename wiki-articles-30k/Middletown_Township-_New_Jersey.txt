Sea captain and explorer Henry Hudson, in search of the mythical Northwest Passage in the service of the Dutch West India Company,  anchored along the shores of Sandy Hook Bay in 1609, describing the area "a very good land to fall in with and a pleasant land to see."

" There are five fire chiefs representing the different fire companies in sequential order. Each chief is a member nominated by their respective company and then elected by the department for appointment by the township committee. They serve the position for up to five years starting from 3rd Assistant Chief and moving up to Chief of the Department after each year of successful election. The companies, in order of creation, are as follows: For a time these companies acted separately until August 28, 1928, when all the individual companies were brought together to form the current fire department. Since then, two more companies have been formed: Later, the individual companies took on station numbers with regard to their creation date.

There are other special units besides the main fire companies. The MTFD has its own Fire Police Unit, Air Unit, and Special Services Unit (SSU). The Middletown Township Fire Academy was established in 1974 to provide basic firefighter training to the township's volunteers. A tract of land was donated off of Normandy Road for the cause and the volunteer firefighters built its beginnings themselves. Classes began in trailers until a suitable classroom building was constructed. A small wooden multi-floor building sitting on buried telephone poles was the earliest training structure. Later a proper "smokehouse" made of cinder block served firefighters until 2007 when it was closed. The classroom building and smokehouse are featured in the academy's logo. A four-story corrugated steel "ladder tower" building was constructed as the academy's high rise prop. There are internal and external stairways with a standpipe and sprinkler system throughout, only fed with water by an engine during training. It also features trapdoors creating an internal column for rope rescue training. For a period of time there was a SCBA maze located in a lower room of the building until it was converted into a live burn room after the smokehouse was closed. Vehicle extrication as well as car and fuel fires are fought on the "burn pad" which is an open concrete area next to the smokehouse. Donated vehicles are brought in from various sources. Typically they are used first for extrication by a first aid or fire company and then later get burned for car fire training by another. Fuels fires are contained in drums or tanks that have been cut open. A confined space prop was located next to the main parking lot which was a large pipe with access ways buried under dirt. Trench rescue simulations were also held near this prop. One of the more recent additions to the academy is the flashover chamber. A peaked roof prop sits in the middle of the academy which utilizes replaceable 4x8 plywood sheets for firefighters to practice cutting roofs. There was at one time a flat roof prop as well. The Fire Academy's motto is "Training the Best, for the Worst". Firefighter I (aka "basic") classes are held in the spring and fall. Topics and graduation requirements surpass that of Monmouth County Fire Academy. Other courses from firefighting to Incident Command and more are offered by the academy. Other agencies also sponsor courses that use the facilities. Aside from the Middletown Township fire companies and first aid squads, outside departments such as those from Jersey City, Bayonne, Fort Monmouth, and others have come to Middletown Township for training at the academy. The classrooms are also used by the Board of Education and for police training. The township's shooting range is located on the same property adjacent to the fire academy.

These squads also have boats and dive teams to perform rescue and recovery operations involving water which have been called out of town to assist with large area searches. Port Monmouth provides a bariatric unit, a converted ambulance, for severely overweight patients. It has been requested outside of Middletown Township as a back-up for MONOC's unit. Advanced Life Support (ALS) or paramedics for the township and surrounding towns are provided by MONOC. The two primary paramedic units for Middletown Township are Medic 206 located at MTFD Station 8 (Middletown Fire Company No. 1) covering a majority of the town and Medic 201 located at South Aberdeen First Aid Squad in Aberdeen covering the Northwestern end of town.
