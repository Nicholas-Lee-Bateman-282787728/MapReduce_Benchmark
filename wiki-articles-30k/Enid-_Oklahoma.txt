 Enid (ē'nĭd) is a city in Garfield County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 49,379, making it the ninth largest city in Oklahoma. It is the county seat of Garfield County. Enid was founded during the opening of the Cherokee Outlet in the Land Run of 1893, and is named after Enid, a character in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's Idylls of the King. In 1991, the Oklahoma state legislature designated Enid the "Purple Martin Capital of Oklahoma.""Purple Martin State Capitals", Nature Society News, June 2006, pg 8. Enid holds the nickname of "Queen Wheat City" and "Wheat Capital" of Oklahoma and the United States for its immense grain storage capacity, and has the third largest grain storage capacity in the world. The economy of Enid is diverse, but its foundation is the oil and gas industry and agriculture.  In summer 1889, M.A. Low, a Rock Island official, visited the local railroad station then under construction, and inquired about its name. At that time, it was called Skeleton station. Disliking the original name, he renamed the station Enid after a character in Alfred Lord Tennyson's Idylls of the King. However, a more fanciful story of how the town received its name is popular. According to that tale, in the days following the land run, some enterprising settlers decided to set up a chuckwagon and cook for their fellow pioneers, hanging a sign that read "DINE". Some other, more free-spirited settlers, turned that sign backward to read, of course, "ENID". The name stuck. During the opening of the Cherokee Outlet in the Land Run of 1893, Enid was the location of a land office which is now preserved in its Humphrey Heritage Village, part of the Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center. Enid, the rail station, (now North Enid, Oklahoma) was the original town site endorsed by the government. It was platted by the surveyor W. D. Twichell, then of Amarillo, Texas.   The Enid-Pond Creek Railroad War ensued when the Department of the Interior moved the government site three miles (5&nbsp;km) south of the station prior to the land run, which was then called South Enid. During the run, due to the Rock Island's refusal to stop, people leaped from the trains to stake their claim in the government endorsed site.Intensive Level Historical/Architectural Survey of Enid's Downtown, Susan Roth and Associates, 1994, page 63. By the afternoon of the run, Enid's population was estimated at 12,000 people located in the Enid's  town plat.Intensive Level Historical/Architectural Survey of Enid's Downtown, Susan Roth and Associates, 1994, page 62. Enid's original plat in 1893 was 6 blocks wide by 11 blocks long consisting of the town square on the northwest end, West Hill  (Jefferson) school on the south west end, Government Springs Park in the middle southern section, and East Hill (Garfield) school on the far north east corner.Rockwell, Stella, ed. Garfield County, Oklahoma 1893-1982 Vol II, Josten's Publishing Company, 1982. page 519 A year later, the population was estimated at 4,410, growing to 10,087 by 1907, the year of Oklahoma statehood."Architectural/Historical Survey of Certain Parts of Enid," Meacham and Associates, 1992, page 21 The town's early history was captured in Cherokee Strip: A Tale of an Oklahoma Boyhood by Pulitzer-winning author Marquis James, who recounts his boyhood in Enid.James, Marquis, Cherokee Strip: A Tale of an Oklahoma Boyhood, page 18-19 He writes of the early town: Enid experienced a "golden age" following the discovery of oil in the region in the 1910s and continuing until World War II.Intensive Level Historical/Architectural Survey of Enid's Downtown, Susan Roth and Associates, 1994, page 70. Enid's economy boomed as a result of the growing oil, wheat, and rail industries, and its population grew steadily throughout the early 20th century in conjunction with a period of substantial architectural development and land expansion. Enid's downtown saw the construction of several buildings including the Broadway Tower, Garfield County Courthouse, and Enid Masonic Temple. In conjunction with the oil boom, oilmen such as T.T. Eason, H.H. Champlin, and Charles E. Knox built homes in the area. Residential additions during this period include Kenwood, Waverley, Weatherly, East Hill, Kinser Heights, Buena Vista, and McKinley."Architectural/Historical Survey of Certain Parts of Enid," Meacham and Associates, 1992, page 23-31.
