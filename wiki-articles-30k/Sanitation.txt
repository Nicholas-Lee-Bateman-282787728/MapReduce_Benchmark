   Sanitation is the hygienic means of promoting health through prevention of human contact with the hazards of wastes as well as the treatment and proper disposal of sewage or wastewater. Hazards can be either physical, microbiological, biological or chemical agents of disease. Wastes that can cause health problems include human and animal excreta, solid wastes, domestic wastewater (sewage or greywater) industrial wastes and agricultural wastes. Hygienic means of prevention can be by using engineering solutions (e.g., sanitary sewers, sewage treatment, surface runoff management, solid waste management, excreta management), simple technologies (e.g., pit latrines, dry toilets, urine-diverting dry toilets, septic tanks), or even simply by [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior changes]] in personal hygiene practices, such as [[hand washing]] with soap.  Providing sanitation to people requires a systems approach, rather than only focusing on the [[toilet]] or [[wastewater treatment]] plant itself.<ref name=":1">Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph. and Zurbrügg, C.

The word 'sanitation' also refers to the maintenance of hygienic conditions, through services such as garbage collection and wastewater disposal."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/sanitation/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |work=Health topics |title=Sanitation }}</ref>}}  Sanitation includes all four of these engineering infrastructure items (even though often only the first one is strongly associated with the term "sanitation"): Excreta management systems, wastewater management systems (included here are [[wastewater treatment plants]]), solid waste management systems, drainage systems for rainwater, also called stormwater drainage.  There are some slight variations on the definition of sanitation in use. For example, for many organisations, [[hygiene]] promotion is seen as an integral part of sanitation. For this reason, the [[Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council]] defines sanitation as "The collection, transport, treatment and disposal or [[Reuse of excreta|reuse of human excreta]], domestic wastewater and solid waste, and associated hygiene promotion."<ref>Evans, B., van der Voorden, C., Peal, A. (2009). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2010 Public Funding for Sanitation - The many faces of sanitation subsidies]. Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC), Geneva, Switzerland, p. 35</ref>  Despite the fact that sanitation includes wastewater treatment, the two terms are often use side by side as "sanitation and wastewater management". The term sanitation has been connected to several descriptors so that the terms sustainable sanitation, improved sanitation, unimproved sanitation, environmental sanitation, on-site sanitation, ecological sanitation, dry sanitation are all in use today. Sanitation should be regarded with a systems approach in mind which includes collection/containment, conveyance/transport, treatment, disposal or reuse.<ref>Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph. and Zurbrügg, C. (2014). [http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies (2nd Revised Edition)]. Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland</ref>  The overall purposes of sanitation are to provide a healthy living environment for everyone, to protect the natural resources (such as [[surface water]], [[groundwater]], [[soil]]), and to provide safety, security and [[dignity]] for people when they [[defecate]] or [[urinate]].  Effective sanitation systems provide barriers between excreta and humans in such a way as to break the [[disease transmission]] cycle (for example in the case of fecal-borne diseases).<ref>Thor Axel Stenström (2005) [http://conference2005.ecosan.org/papers/stenstrom.pdf Breaking the sanitation barriers; WHO Guidelines for excreta use as a baseline for environmental health], Ecosan Conference, Durban, South Africa</ref> This aspect is visualised with the F-diagram where all major routes of [[fecal-oral route|fecal-oral disease transmission]] begin with the letter F: feces, fingers, flies, fields, fluids, food.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Conant|first1=Jeff|title=Sanitation and Cleanliness for a Healthy Environment|date=2005|publisher=The Hesperian Foundation in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Sida|location=Berkely, California, USA|page=6|url=http://www.unwater.org/downloads/EHB_Sanitation_EN_lowres.pdf}}</ref>  == Types == The term sanitation is connected with various descriptors or adjectives to signify certain types of sanitation systems (which may deal only with [[human excreta]] management or with the entire sanitation system, i.e. also greywater, stormwater and solid waste management) - in alphabetical order:  === Community-led total sanitation === {{Main|Community-led total sanitation}} Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is an approach to achieve [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] in mainly rural people by a process of "triggering", leading to spontaneous and long-term abandonement of [[open defecation]] practices. CLTS takes an approach to rural sanitation that works without hardware subsidies and that facilitates communities to recognize the problem of open defecation and take [[collective action]] to clean up and become "open defecation free".  === Dry sanitation === {{Further|Dry toilet}} The term "dry sanitation" is somewhat misleading as sanitation includes handwashing and can never be "dry". A more precise term would be "dry excreta management". When people speak of "dry sanitation" they usually mean sanitation systems with [[dry toilet]]s with [[urine diversion]], in particular the [[urine-diverting dry toilet]] (UDDT).<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJmgtZK1dvM|title = AKUT Sustainable Sanitation in Peru|date = 13 October 2014|accessdate = 21 October 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>  ===  Ecological sanitation === {{Main|Ecological sanitation}} [[Ecological sanitation]], which is commonly abbreviated to ecosan, is an approach, rather than a technology or a device which is characterized by a desire to "close the loop" (mainly for the nutrients and organic matter) between sanitation and agriculture in a safe manner. Put in other words: "Ecosan systems safely recycle excreta resources (plant nutrients and organic matter) to crop production in such a way that the use of non-renewable resources is minimised". When properly designed and operated, ecosan systems provide a hygienically safe, economical, and closed-loop system to convert human excreta into nutrients to be returned to the soil, and water to be returned to the land. Ecosan is also called resource-oriented sanitation.  === Environmental sanitation === Environmental sanitation encompasses the control of environmental factors that are connected to [[disease transmission]]. Subsets of this category are solid waste management, water and [[wastewater]] treatment, [[industrial waste]] treatment and noise and pollution control.  === Improved and unimproved sanitation === {{Main|Improved sanitation}} [[Improved sanitation]] and [[unimproved sanitation]] refers to the management of human feces at the household level. This terminology is the indicator used to describe the target of the [[Millennium Development Goal]] on sanitation, by the [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]] [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]].  === Lack of sanitation === Lack of sanitation refers to the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily. The result of lack of sanitation is usually [[open defecation]] (and open urination but this is of less concern) with the associated serious public health issues.  === On-site sanitation === {{Further|Onsite sewage facility}} On-site sanitation, also called decentralised sanitation, is a system where the treatment of excreta or [[sewage]] takes place at the same location where it is generated. Examples are pit [[latrine]]s, [[septic tank]]s, and [[Imhoff tank]]s. A [[septic tank]] and [[Septic drain field|drainfield]] combination is the oldest and most common type of on-site sewage facility in the U.S., although newer [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[biofilter]] units exist which represent scaled down versions of municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants.  === Sustainable sanitation === {{Main|Sustainable sanitation}} [[Sustainable sanitation]] considers the entire "sanitation value chain", from the experience of the user, [[Human excreta|excreta]] and [[wastewater]] collection methods, transportation or conveyance of waste, treatment, and reuse or disposal.<ref name=":1" /> The term is widely used since about 2009. In 2007 the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] had defined five sustainability criteria to compare the sustainability of sanitation systems. In order to be sustainable, a sanitation system has to be not only (i) economically viable, (ii) socially acceptable, and (iii) technically and (iv) institutionally appropriate, it should also (v) protect the environment and the natural resources.<ref name=":2">SuSanA (2008).

Lack of proper sanitation causes diseases. Most of the diseases resulting from sanitation have a direct relation to poverty. The lack of clean water and poor sanitation causes many diseases and the spread of diseases. It is estimated that inadequate sanitation is responsible for 4.0 percent of deaths and 5.7 percent of disease burden worldwide.<ref>Prüss A, Kay D, Fewtrell L, Bartram J (2002) [http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/global/en/ArticleEHP052002.pdf Estimating the burden of disease from water, sanitation, and hygiene at a global level.] Environmental Health Perspectives 110: 537–542.</ref>  Lack of sanitation is a serious issue that is affecting most developing countries and countries in transition. The importance of the isolation of excreta and waste lies in an effort to prevent diseases which can be [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] through human waste, which afflict both [[developed countries]] as well as [[developing countries]] to differing degrees.

However, based on expert opinions and a literature survey, researchers at WHO arrived at the conclusion that approximately half of all cases of malnutrition (which often leads to stunting) in children under five is associated with repeated diarrhoea or intestinal worm infectionsas a result of unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene.<sup>[6]</sup>  === List of diseases caused by lack of sanitation === Relevant diseases and conditions caused by lack of sanitation and hygiene include: * [[Waterborne diseases]], which can contaminate drinking water * Diseases transmitted by the [[fecal-oral route]] ** [[helminthiasis|Infections with intestinal helminths]] (worms) - approximately two billion people are infected with [[soil-transmitted helminths]] worldwide; they are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces which in turn contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor.<ref>WHO (2014) [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs366/en/ Soil-transmitted helminth infections], Fact sheet N°366 </ref> * [[Stunted growth]] in children * [[Malnutrition]], particularly in children  The list of diseases that could be reduced with proper access to sanitation and hygiene practices is very long.

Commonly used indicators for [[bacteriological water analysis]] include the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (abbreviated as ''E. coli)'' and non-specific fecal [[coliforms]]''.'' With regards to samples of [[soil]], [[sewage sludge]], [[biosolids]] or fecal matter from [[dry toilet]]s, [[helminth]] eggs are a commonly used indicator. Viable helminth eggs can be extracted from the samples and counted.  == Other industries or sectors ==  ===Wastewater and stormwater management=== {{Main|Wastewater}} [[Image:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|[[Sewage treatment]] plant, [[Australia]].]] Wastewater management consists of collection, [[wastewater treatment]] (be it municipal or [[industrial wastewater]]), disposal or reuse of treated wastewater. The latter is also referred to as [[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]].  The standard sanitation technology in urban areas is the collection of [[wastewater]] in sewers, its treatment in [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] for [[reuse]] or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. Sewers are either combined with [[storm drain]]s or separated from them as [[sanitary sewer]]s. [[Combined sewer]]s are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy [[stormwater|rainfall]] and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s, i.e., more or less diluted raw [[sewage]] being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.<ref>''Environmental [[Biotechnology]]: Advancement in Water And Wastewater Application'', edited by Z. Ujang, IWA Proceedings, [[Malaysia]] (2003)</ref>  The high investment cost of conventional wastewater collection systems are difficult to afford for many [[developing countries]]. Some countries have therefore promoted alternative wastewater collection systems such as condominial sewerage, which uses pipes with smaller diameters at lower depth with different network layouts from conventional sewerage.  In developed countries centralised treatment of municipal wastewater is now quite widespread. In [[developing countries]] most wastewater is still discharged untreated into the environment. For example, in Latin America only about 15% of collected sewage is being treated (see [[water and sanitation in Latin America]]).  In many suburban and rural areas households are not connected to sewers, and they rather use [[Onsite sewage facility|on-site sewage facilities]] or decentralised treatment if they are connected to piped water and use flush toilets. They discharge their wastewater into [[septic tank]]s or other types of on-site sanitation systems (e.g. [[Sequencing batch reactor]]s or [[constructed wetland]]s). On-site systems include [[drain field]]s, which require significant area of land. This makes septic systems unsuitable for most cities.  The reuse of untreated or partially treated wastewater in [[Irrigation|irrigated agriculture]] is common in developing countries. The reuse of treated wastewater in landscaping, especially on golf courses, irrigated agriculture and for industrial use is becoming increasingly widespread.  ===Solid waste disposal=== {{Main|Waste management}} [[Image:Israel hiriya.jpg|thumb|[[Hiriya|Hiriya Landfill]], [[Israel]].]] Disposal of [[solid waste]] is most commonly conducted in [[landfill]]s, but incineration, [[recycling]], [[compost]]ing and conversion to [[biofuel]]s are also avenues.  In the case of landfills, [[advanced countries]] typically have rigid protocols for [[daily cover]] with topsoil, where [[underdeveloped countries]] customarily rely upon less stringent protocols.<ref>George Tchobanoglous and Frank Kreith ''Handbook of Solid Waste Management'', McGraw Hill (2002)</ref>  The importance of daily cover lies in the reduction of vector contact and spreading of [[pathogen]]s. Daily cover also minimises odor emissions and reduces windblown litter. Likewise, developed countries typically have requirements for perimeter sealing of the landfill with clay-type soils to minimize migration of [[leachate]] that could contaminate [[groundwater]] (and hence jeopardize some [[drinking water]] supplies).  For incineration options, the release of [[air pollutant]]s, including certain [[toxic]] components is an attendant adverse outcome.  Recycling and biofuel conversion are the [[sustainable]] options that generally have superior lifecycle costs, particularly when total [[ecological]] consequences are considered.<ref>William D. Robinson, ''The Solid Waste [[Handbook]]: A Practical Guide'', John Wiley and sons (1986)</ref>  Composting value will ultimately be limited by the market demand for compost product.  ===Food industry=== [[Image:Canteen kitchen.jpg|thumb|220px|Modern [[restaurant]] food preparation area.]] {{Details|food safety}} Sanitation within the food industry means the adequate treatment of food-contact surfaces by a process that is effective in destroying vegetative cells of [[microorganism]]s of [[public health]] significance, and in substantially reducing numbers of other undesirable microorganisms, but without adversely affecting the food or its safety for the consumer ([[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], [[Code of Federal Regulations]], 21CFR110, USA).  [[Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures]] are mandatory for food industries in [[United States]], which are regulated by 9 CFR part 416 in conjunction with 21 CFR part 178.1010. Similarly, in Japan, food hygiene has to be achieved through compliance with food sanitation law.<ref name="fslj">{{cite web   | last = [[Japan External Trade Organization]]   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Food Sanitation Law in Japan   | work =   | publisher =   | date =   | url = http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/market/regulations/pdf/food-e.pdf   |format=PDF| doi =   | accessdate = 1 March 2008   }}</ref>  In the food and [[biopharmaceutical]] industries, the term "sanitary equipment" means equipment that is fully cleanable using [[clean-in-place]] (CIP) and sterilization-in-place (SIP) procedures: that is fully drainable from cleaning solutions and other [[liquid]]s. The design should have a minimum amount of deadleg, or areas where the [[turbulence]] during cleaning is insufficient to remove product deposits.<ref>[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=JFEGA4000127000001000124000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes Treatment of deadleg plumbing areas]</ref> In general, to improve cleanability, this equipment is made from [[Stainless Steel]] 316L, (an [[alloy]] containing small amounts of [[molybdenum]]).

The specific goal for the year 2015 is to reduce by half the number of people who had no access to [[drinking water|potable water]] and sanitation in the baseline year of 1990.  In 2004, the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) of the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) and of the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) reported that the number of people lacking basic sanitation services rose from 2.1 billion in 2001 to 2.6 billion by 2004. As the JMP and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) Human Development Report in 2006 has shown, progress meeting the MDG sanitation target is too slow, with a large gap between the target coverage and the current reality.  There are numerous reasons for this gap. A major one is that sanitation is rarely given political attention received by other topics despite its key importance. Sanitation is not high on the international development agenda, and projects such as those relating to [[water supply]] projects are emphasised.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  In December 2006, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] declared 2008 "The [[International Year of Sanitation]]", in recognition of the slow progress being made towards the MDGs sanitation target.<ref name="Kurian and McCarney">{{cite web|url=http://www.springer.com/978-90-481-9424-7|title=Peri-urban Water and Sanitation Services | year=2010 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}</ref>  The year aimed to develop awareness and action to meet the target. Particular concerns are: *  Removing the stigma around sanitation, so that the importance of sanitation can be more easily and publicly discussed. *  Highlighting the [[poverty reduction]], [[health]] and other benefits that flow from better hygiene, household sanitation arrangements and wastewater treatment. The [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] has defined [[improved sanitation]] as follows:<ref>WHO and UNICEF [http://www.wssinfo.org/definitions-methods/watsan-categories/, types of improved drinking-water source on the JMP website], WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, accessed on June 10, 2012</ref> * [[Flush toilet]] or flush / pour-flush to a [[pit toilet|pit latrine]] with are connected to either a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] system or a [[Septic tank|septic system]] * Ventilated improved pit latrine (VIP) * [[Pit latrine]] with slab * [[Composting toilet]]  The JMP publishes a report of updated estimates every two years on the use of various types of drinking-water sources and sanitation facilities at the national, regional and global levels. In March 2012, the JMP released its latest updates.<ref>WHO and UNICEF [http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/JMP-report-2012-en.pdf, ''Progress on Drinking-water and Sanitation: 2012 Update''], WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York</ref> According to the definition above, 1.8 billion more people used improved sanitation in 2010 than in 1990, bringing the percentage of people using improved sanitation to 63% globally. However, the world remains off track for the sanitation target of the [[Millennium Development Goal]]s. 2.5 billion lack improved sanitation.<ref>WHO and UNICEF [http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/JMP-report-2012-en.pdf, ''Progress on Drinking-water and Sanitation: 2012 Update''], WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, page 2</ref> According to the JMP, if current trends continue, in 2015 2.4 billion people will lack access to improved sanitation facilities. 15 per cent of the population still practise [[open defecation]], defined as defecation in fields, forests, bushes, bodies of water or other open spaces. This represents 1.1 billion people. Though the proportion of people practising [[open defecation]] is decreasing, the absolute number has remained at over one billion for several years, due to population growth.<ref>WHO and UNICEF [http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/JMP-report-2012-en.pdf, ''Progress on Drinking-water and Sanitation: 2012 Update''], WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, page 5</ref> In 2011 the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] launched the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge to promote safer, more effective ways to treat human waste. The program is aimed at developing technologies that might help bridge the global sanitation gap.  This outcome presents substantial public health risks as the waste could contaminate [[drinking water]] and cause life-threatening forms of [[diarrhea]] to infants. Most cities can neither afford a sewage drainage system, nor a sewage treatment system, as Sunita Narain spelled out in the magazine [http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220395/index.en.shtml ''D+C Development and Cooperation'']. Improved sanitation, including [[hand washing]] and water purification, could save the lives of 1.5 million children who die from diarrheal diseases each year.<ref name="who.int">[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/jmp2008.pdf World Health Organization and UNICEF. Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation: Special Focus on Sanitation.]</ref>  === Importance in development cooperation === Research from the [[Overseas Development Institute]] suggests that sanitation and hygiene promotion needs to be better "mainstreamed" in [[development cooperation]], if the MDG on sanitation is to be met. At present, promotion of sanitation and hygiene is mainly carried out through water institutions. The research argues that there are, in fact, many institutions that should carry out activities to develop better sanitation and hygiene in developing countries. For example, educational institutions can teach on [[hygiene]], and health institutions can dedicate resources to preventative works (to avoid, for example, outbreaks of [[cholera]]).<ref name="odisanitation">{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=48&title=sanitation-hygiene-knocking-doors |format=PDF|title=Sanitation and Hygiene: knocking on new doors  |accessdate=2007 |year=2006 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]}}</ref> There are also civil society organisations providing the necessary infrastructure where national governments cannot do that on their own.  ==History== {{Further|Toilet#History|History of water supply and sanitation|History of waste management}} The earliest evidence of urban sanitation was seen in [[Harappa]], [[Mohenjo-daro]], and the recently discovered [[Rakhigarhi]] of [[Indus Valley civilization]]. This urban plan included the world's first urban sanitation systems. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from [[Water well|wells]]. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, waste water was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets.  [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cities and [[Roman villa]]s had elements of sanitation systems, delivering water in the streets of towns such as [[Pompeii]], and building stone and wooden drains to collect and remove [[wastewater]] from populated areas—see for instance the [[Cloaca Maxima]] into the [[River Tiber]] in Rome. But there is little record of other sanitation in most of Europe until the [[High Middle Ages]]. Unsanitary conditions and overcrowding were widespread throughout [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] during the [[Middle Ages]], resulting periodically in cataclysmic [[pandemic]]s such as the [[Plague of Justinian]] (541-42) and the [[Black Death]] (1347–1351), which killed tens of millions of people and radically altered societies.<ref>Carlo M.
