   Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review  from March 1918 to December 1920, and then published in its entirety by Sylvia Beach in February 1922, in Paris. It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature, (review of Danius book). and has been called "a demonstration and summation of the entire movement".Beebe (1971), p. 176. According to Declan Kiberd, "Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking." Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904.Keillor, Garrison, "The Writer's Almanac", 2 February 2010. Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early twentieth century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland's relationship to Britain. The novel imitates registers of centuries of English literature and is highly allusive. Ulysses is approximately 265,000 words in length, uses a lexicon of 30,030 words (including proper names, plurals and various verb tenses), and is divided into eighteen episodes. Since publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from early obscenity trials to protracted textual "Joyce Wars". Ulysses' [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose — full of [[pun]]s, [[Parody|parodies]], and [[allusion]]s — as well as its rich [[characterization|characterisation]] and broad humour, made the book a highly regarded novel in the [[Modernism|modernist]] pantheon. Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as [[Bloomsday]]. In 1998, the American publishing firm [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Ulysses'' first on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].<ref>{{cite web | title = 100 Best Novels | publisher = Random House | year=  1999 | url =  http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html | accessdate = 2007-06-23 }} This ranking was by the [http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/about/board.html Modern Library Editorial Board] of authors and critics; readers ranked it 11th.

At first glance much of the book may appear unstructured and chaotic; Joyce once said that he had "put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant", which would earn the novel "immortality".<ref>{{cite news | title = The bookies' Booker... |work=The Observer  | date=  5 November 2000 | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/bookerprize2000/story/0,,392737,00.html | accessdate = 2002-02-16 | location=London}}</ref> The two schemata which [[Stuart Gilbert]] and Herbert Gorman released after publication to defend Joyce from the obscenity accusations made the links to the ''[[Odyssey]]'' clear, and also explained the work's internal structure.  Every episode of ''Ulysses'' has a theme, technique, and correspondence between its characters and those of the ''Odyssey''. The original text did not include these episode titles and the correspondences; instead, they originate from the [[Linati schema for Ulysses|Linati]] and [[Gilbert schema for Ulysses|Gilbert]] schemata. Joyce referred to the episodes by their Homeric titles in his letters. He took the idiosyncratic rendering of some of the titles, e.g. "Nausikaa" and the "Telemachia". from [[Victor Bérard]]'s two-volume ''Les Phéniciens et l'Odyssée'' which he consulted in 1918 in the [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich]].  ===Part I: The Telemachid===  ====Episode 1, ''[[Telemachus]]''==== [[File:James Joyce Tower and Museum3.JPG|thumb|right|200px|James Joyce's room in the present-day [[James Joyce Tower and Museum]]]] It is 8&nbsp;a.m. [[Buck Mulligan]], a boisterous medical student, calls [[Stephen Dedalus]] (a young writer encountered as the principal subject of ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'') up to the roof of the [[James Joyce Tower and Museum|Sandycove Martello tower]] where they both live. There is tension between Stephen and Mulligan, stemming from a cruel remark Stephen has overheard Mulligan making about his recently deceased mother, [[May Golding Dedalus|May Dedalus]], and from the fact that Mulligan has invited an English student, [[Haines (character)|Haines]], to stay with them. The three men eat breakfast and walk to the shore, where Mulligan demands from Stephen the key to the tower and a loan.  Departing, Stephen declares that he will not return to the tower tonight, as Mulligan, the "usurper", has taken it over.  ====Episode 2, ''[[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]''==== Stephen is teaching a history class on the victories of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]. After class, one student, [[Cyril Sargent]], stays behind so that Stephen can show him how to do a set of arithmetic exercises.  Stephen looks at the aesthetically unappealing Sargent and tries to imagine Sargent's mother's love for him.  Stephen then visits school headmaster, [[Garrett Deasy]], from whom he collects his pay and a letter to take to a newspaper office for printing.  The two discuss Irish history and the role of Jews in the economy.  As Stephen leaves, Deasy makes a final derogatory remark against the Jews, stating that Ireland has never extensively persecuted the Jews because they were never let in to the country.  This episode is the source of some of the novel's most famous lines, such as Dedalus's claim that "history is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake" and that God is "a shout in the street."  ====Episode 3, ''[[Proteus]]''==== [[File:IMG SandymountStrabd1461.jpg|thumb|220px|Sandymount Strand looking across Dublin Bay to Howth Head]] Stephen finds his way to [[Sandymount Strand]] and mopes around for some time, mulling various philosophical concepts, his family, his life as a student in Paris, and his mother's death. As Stephen reminisces and ponders, he lies down among some rocks, watches a couple and a dog, scribbles some ideas for poetry, picks his nose and urinates behind a rock.  This chapter is characterised by a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] narrative style that changes focus wildly.  Stephen's education is reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in this episode, which have earned it a reputation for being one of the book's most difficult chapters.  ===Part II: The Odyssey===  [[File:יוליסס.png|thumbnail]]  ====Episode 4, ''[[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]''==== The narrative shifts abruptly. The time is again 8&nbsp;am, but the action has moved across the city and to the second protagonist of the book, Leopold Bloom, a part-Jewish advertising canvasser. Bloom, after starting to prepare breakfast, decides to walk to a butcher to buy a pork kidney.  Returning home, he prepares breakfast and brings it with the mail to his wife [[Molly Bloom|Molly]] as she lounges in bed.  One of the letters is from her concert manager [[Blazes Boylan]].  Bloom is aware that Molly will welcome Boylan into her bed later that day, and is tormented by the thought.  Bloom reads a letter from their daughter [[Milly Bloom]].  The chapter closes with Bloom defecating in the outhouse.  ====Episode 5, ''[[Lotus Eaters]]''==== Bloom makes his way to [[Westland Row]] post office where he receives a love letter from one 'Martha Clifford' addressed to his pseudonym, 'Henry Flower'. He meets an acquaintance, and while they chat, Bloom attempts to ogle a woman wearing stockings, but is prevented by a passing tram. Next, he reads the letter and tears up the envelope in an alley. He wanders into a Catholic church service and muses on theology. The priest has the letters [[Jesus, King of the Jews|I.N.R.I.]] or [[Christogram#Western Christianity|I.H.S.]] on his back; Molly had told Bloom that they meant ''I have sinned'' or ''I have suffered'', and ''Iron nails ran in''.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4300/pg4300.txt Text of Ulysses; search for "I.N.R.I."]</ref> He goes to a chemist where he buys a bar of lemon soap. He then meets another acquaintance, [[Bantam Lyons]], who mistakenly takes him to be offering a racing tip for the horse ''Throwaway''. Finally, Bloom heads towards the baths.  ====Episode 6, ''[[Hades]]''==== The episode begins with Bloom entering a funeral carriage with three others, including Stephen's father. They drive to [[Paddy Dignam]]'s funeral, making small talk on the way. The carriage passes both Stephen and Blazes Boylan. There is discussion of various forms of death and burial, and Bloom is preoccupied by thoughts of his dead son, Rudy, and the suicide of his own father. They enter the chapel into the service and subsequently leave with the coffin cart. Bloom sees a mysterious man wearing a [[mackintosh]] during the burial. Bloom continues to reflect upon death, but at the end of the episode rejects morbid thoughts to embrace 'warm fullblooded life'.  ====Episode 7, ''[[Aeolus]]''==== At the office of the [[Freeman's Journal]], Bloom attempts to place an ad. Although initially encouraged by the editor, he is unsuccessful. Stephen arrives bringing Deasy's letter about 'foot and mouth' disease, but Stephen and Bloom do not meet. Stephen leads the editor and others to a pub, relating an anecdote on the way about 'two Dublin vestals'. The episode is broken into short segments by newspaper-style headlines, and is characterised by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices.  ====Episode 8, ''[[Laestrygonians|Lestrygonians]]''==== [[File:DavyByrnesPubDublin.jpg|thumb|130px|Davy Byrne’s Pub, Dublin, where Bloom consumes a gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy]] Bloom's thoughts are peppered with references to food as lunchtime approaches. He meets an old flame and hears news of Mina Purefoy's labour. He enters the restaurant of the Burton Hotel where he is revolted by the sight of men eating like animals. He goes instead to [[Davy Byrne's pub]], where he consumes a gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy, and muses upon the early days of his relationship with Molly and how the marriage has declined: 'Me. And me now.'  Bloom's thoughts touch on what goddesses and gods eat and drink.  He ponders whether the statues of Greek goddesses in the [[National Museum of Ireland|National Museum]] have alimentary-canal exits as do mortals.  On leaving the pub Bloom heads toward the museum, but spots Boylan across the street and, panicking, rushes into the gallery across the street from the museum.  ====Episode 9, ''[[Scylla and Charybdis]]''==== [[File:Dublin, Nationalbiblioteket, Nordisk familjebok.png|right|200px|thumb|[[National Library of Ireland]]]] At the [[National Library of Ireland|National Library]], Stephen explains to various scholars his biographical theory of the works of [[Shakespeare]], especially ''[[Hamlet]]'', which he claims are based largely on the posited adultery of [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare's wife)|Shakespeare's wife]].  Bloom enters the National Library to look up an old copy of the ad he has been trying to place. He encounters Stephen briefly and unknowingly at the end of the episode.  ====Episode 10, ''[[Wandering Rocks]]''==== In this episode, nineteen short vignettes depict the wanderings of various characters, major and minor, through the streets of Dublin. The episode ends with an account of the cavalcade of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], [[William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley|William Ward, Earl of Dudley]], through the streets, which is encountered by various characters from the novel.  ====Episode 11, ''[[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]]''==== In this episode, dominated by motifs of music, Bloom has dinner with Stephen's uncle at a hotel, while Molly's lover, [[Blazes Boylan]], proceeds to his rendezvous with her. While dining, Bloom watches the seductive barmaids and listens to the singing of Stephen's father and others.  ====Episode 12, ''[[Cyclops]]''==== This chapter is narrated by an unnamed denizen of Dublin. The narrator goes to [[Barney Kiernan]]'s pub where he meets a character referred to only as [[The Citizen (character)|"The Citizen"]]. When Leopold Bloom enters the pub, he is berated by the Citizen, who is a fierce [[Fenian]] and anti-Semite.  The episode ends with Bloom reminding the Citizen that his Saviour was a Jew.  As Bloom leaves the pub, the Citizen, in anger, throws a biscuit tin at Bloom's head, but misses.  The chapter is marked by extended tangents made in voices other than that of the unnamed narrator: these include streams of legal jargon, Biblical passages, and elements of Irish mythology.  ====Episode 13, ''[[Nausicaa]]''==== Gerty MacDowell, a young woman on Sandymount strand, contemplates love, marriage and femininity as night falls.  The reader is gradually made aware that Bloom is watching her from a distance, and as she exposes her legs and underwear to him it is unclear how much of the narrative is actually Bloom’s sexual fantasy.  Bloom’s masturbatory climax is echoed by the fireworks at the nearby bazaar.  As Gerty leaves, Bloom realises that she has a lame leg.  After several digressions of thought he decides to visit Mina Purefoy at the hospital. The style of the first half of the episode borrows from (and parodies) romance magazines and novelettes.  ====Episode 14, ''[[Oxen of the Sun]]''==== Bloom visits the maternity hospital where Mina Purefoy is giving birth, and finally meets Stephen, who has been drinking with his medical student friends and is awaiting the promised arrival of Buck Mulligan. They continue on to a pub to continue drinking, following the successful birth of the baby. This chapter is remarkable for Joyce's wordplay, which, among other things, recapitulates the entire history of the English language.  After a short incantation, the episode starts with latinate prose, [[Old English poetry|Anglo-Saxon alliteration]], and moves on through parodies of, among others, [[Thomas Malory|Malory]], the [[King James Bible]], [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne]], [[Horace Walpole|Walpole]], [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], and [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], before concluding in a haze of nearly incomprehensible slang.  ====Episode 15, ''[[Circe]]''==== Episode 15 is written as a play script, complete with stage directions. The plot is frequently interrupted by "hallucinations" experienced by Stephen and Bloom—fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters.  Stephen and Lynch walk into Nighttown, Dublin's [[red-light district]].  Bloom pursues them and eventually finds them at [[Bella Cohen]]'s brothel, where in the company of her workers including [[Zoe Higgins]], [[Florry Talbot]] and [[Kitty Ricketts]] he has a series of hallucinations regarding his sexual fetishes, fantasies, and transgressions. Bloom is put in the dock to answer charges by a variety of sadistic, accusing women including [[Mrs Yelverton Barry]], [[Mrs Bellingham]] and The Hon [[Mrs Mervyn Talboys]].  When Bloom witnesses Stephen overpaying for services received, Bloom decides to hold onto the rest of Stephen's money for safekeeping.  Stephen hallucinates that the rotting cadaver of his mother has risen up from the floor to confront him.  Terrified, Stephen uses his walking stick to smash a chandelier and then runs out.  Bloom quickly pays Bella for the damage, then runs after Stephen.  Bloom finds Stephen engaged in a heated argument with an English soldier, Private Carr, who, after a perceived insult to the King, punches Stephen. The police arrive and the crowd disperses.  As Bloom is tending to Stephen, Bloom has a hallucination of Rudy, his deceased child.  ===Part III: The [[Nostos]]===  ====Episode 16, ''[[Eumaeus]]''==== Bloom and Stephen go to the cabman's shelter to restore the latter to his senses.  At the cabman's shelter, they encounter a drunken sailor named D. B. Murphy (W. B. Murphy in the 1922 text). The episode is dominated by the motif of confusion and mistaken identity, with Bloom, Stephen and Murphy's identities being repeatedly called into question. The rambling and laboured style of the narrative in this episode reflects the nervous exhaustion and confusion of the two protagonists.  ====Episode 17, ''[[Homer's Ithaca|Ithaca]]''==== Bloom returns home with Stephen, makes him a cup of [[hot chocolate|cocoa]], discusses cultural and lingual differences between them, considers the possibility of publishing Stephen's parable stories, and offers him a place to stay for the night. Stephen refuses Bloom's offer and is ambiguous about Bloom's proposal of future meetings. The two men urinate in the backyard, Stephen departs and wanders off into the night,<ref>Hefferman, James A. W. (2001) [http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=237 ''Joyce’s Ulysses'']. Chantilly, VA: The Teaching Company LP.</ref> and Bloom goes to bed, where Molly is sleeping. She awakens and questions him about his day. The episode is written in the form of a rigidly organised and "mathematical" [[catechism]] of 309 questions and answers, and was reportedly Joyce's favourite episode in the novel.  The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination and include a famous list of 25 men perceived as Molly's lovers (apparently corresponding to the suitors slain at Ithaca by Odysseus and Telemachus in ''The Odyssey''), including Boylan, and Bloom's psychological reaction to their assignation. While describing events apparently chosen randomly in ostensibly precise mathematical or scientific terms, the episode is rife with errors made by the undefined narrator, many or most of which are volitional by Joyce.<ref name="mac">McCarthy, Patrick A., "Joyce's Unreliable Catechist: Mathematics and the Narrative of 'Ithaca'", ''ELH'', Vol. 51, No. 3 (Autumn 1984), pp. 605-606, quoting Joyce in ''Letters From James Joyce''. A famous example is Joyce's apparent rendering of the year 1904 into the impossible [[Roman numeral]] MXMIV (p. 669 of the 1961 Modern Library edition)</ref>  ====Episode 18, ''[[Penelope]]''==== The final episode consists of Molly Bloom's thoughts as she lies in bed next to her husband.  The episode uses a stream-of-consciousness technique in eight sentences and lacks punctuation.  Molly thinks about Boylan and Bloom, her past admirers, including Lieutenant [[Stanley G. Gardner]], the events of the day, her childhood in Gibraltar, and her curtailed singing career.  These thoughts are occasionally interrupted by distractions, such as a train whistle or the need to urinate.  The episode famously concludes with Molly's remembrance of Bloom's marriage proposal, and of her acceptance: "he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes."  ==Editions==  ===Publication history=== [[File:Paris Rue de l Odeon 12 plaque retouched.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque, at 12 [[Rue de l'Odéon]], [[6th arrondissement of Paris|Paris]] saying that "In 1922 [[Sylvia Beach]] published James Joyce's Ulysses in this house.", original location of Shakespeare & Co.]]  The publication history of ''Ulysses'' is disputed and obscure. There have been at least 18 editions, and variations in different impressions of each edition.  Joyce's handwritten manuscripts were typed by a number of amateur typists (one of whom was [[Robert McAlmon]]).<ref>[http://www.haciendahotsprings.com/McAlmon.htm Robert McAlmon biography.]</ref>  According to Joyce scholar [[Jack Dalton (scholar)|Jack Dalton]], the first edition of ''Ulysses'' contained over two thousand errors but was still the most accurate edition published.<ref>Dalton, pp. 102, 113</ref>  As each subsequent edition attempted to correct these mistakes, it incorporated more of its own, a task made more difficult by deliberate errors (See "Episode 17, Ithaca" above) devised by Joyce to challenge the reader.<ref name="mac"/>  Notable editions include: *the first edition published in Paris on 2 February 1922 by Sylvia Beach at [[Shakespeare and Company (bookshop)|Shakespeare and Company]] (only 1000 copies printed) and printed by Darantiere in Dijon *the pirated Roth edition, published in New York in 1929 *the [[Odyssey Press]] edition of 1932 (including some revisions generally attributed to Stuart Gilbert, and therefore sometimes considered the most accurate edition){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} *the 1934 Random House US edition *the first British edition, of [[Bodley Head]] in 1936 *the revised Bodley Head edition of 1960 *the revised Modern Library edition of 1961 (reset from the Bodley Head 1960 edition) *the Gabler critical and synoptic edition of 1984.  ===Gabler's "corrected edition"=== [[Hans Walter Gabler]]'s 1984 edition was the most sustained attempt to produce a corrected text, but it received much criticism, most notably from [[John Kidd (scholar)|John Kidd]]. Kidd's main theoretical criticism is of Gabler's choice of a patchwork of manuscripts as his [[Textual criticism|copy-text]] (the base edition with which the editor compares each variant), but this fault stems from an assumption of the Anglo-American tradition of scholarly editing rather than the blend of French and German editorial theories that actually lay behind Gabler's reasoning.<ref name="Kidd">{{cite journal   | last = Kidd   | first = John   | title = The Scandal of ''Ulysses''   | journal = [[New York Review of Books]]   | date = June 1988   | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1988/jun/30/the-scandal-of-ulysses-2/?pagination=false   | id =   | accessdate = 2010-07-13 }}</ref> The choice of a multiple copy-text is seen to be problematic in the eyes of some American editors, who generally favour the first edition of any particular work as copy-text.<ref name="Kidd"/> Less subject to differing national editorial theories, however, is the claim that for hundreds of pages—about half the episodes of ''Ulysses''—the extant manuscript is purported to be a "[[fair copy]]" which Joyce made for sale to a potential patron. (As it turned out, [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], the Irish-American lawyer and collector, purchased the manuscript.) Diluting this charge somewhat is the fact that the theory of (now lost) final working drafts is Gabler's own. For the suspect episodes, the existing typescript is the last witness. Gabler attempted to reconstruct what he called "the continuous manuscript text", which had never physically existed, by adding together all of Joyce's accretions from the various sources. This allowed Gabler to produce a "synoptic text" indicating the stage at which each addition was inserted. Kidd and even some of Gabler's own advisers believe this method meant losing Joyce's final changes in about two thousand places.<ref name="Kidd"/> Far from being "continuous", the manuscripts seem to be opposite. [[Jerome McGann]] describes in detail the editorial principles of Gabler in his article for the journal ''Criticism'', issue 27, 1985. In the wake of the controversy, still other commentators charged that Gabler's changes were motivated by a desire to secure a fresh copyright and another seventy-five years of royalties beyond a looming expiration date.  In June 1988 John Kidd published "The Scandal of ''Ulysses''" in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'',<ref name="Kidd"/> charging that not only did Gabler's changes overturn Joyce's last revisions, but in another four hundred places Gabler failed to follow any manuscript whatever, making nonsense of his own premises. Kidd accused Gabler of unnecessarily changing Joyce's spelling, punctuation, use of accents, and all the small details he claimed to have been restoring. Instead, Gabler was actually following printed editions such as that of 1932, not the manuscripts. More sensationally, Gabler was found to have made genuine blunders, the most famous being his changing the name of the real-life Dubliner Harry Thrift to 'Shrift' and cricketer Captain Buller to 'Culler' on the basis of handwriting irregularities in the extant manuscript. (These "corrections" were undone by Gabler in 1986.)  Kidd stated that many of Gabler's errors resulted from Gabler's use of facsimiles rather than original manuscripts.  In December 1988, Charles Rossman's "The New ''Ulysses:'' The Hidden Controversy" for the ''New York Review'' revealed that Gabler's own advisers felt too many changes were being made, but that the publishers were pushing for as many alterations as possible. Then Kidd produced a 174-page critique that filled an entire issue of the ''Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America'', dated the same month. This "Inquiry into ''Ulysses'': The Corrected Text" was the next year published in book format and on [[floppy disk]] by Kidd's James Joyce Research Center at [[Boston University]]. Gabler and others rejected Kidd's critique, and the scholarly community remains divided.  ===Gabler edition dropped; publishers revert to 1960/61 editions===  In 1990, Gabler's American publisher Random House, after consulting a committee of scholars,<ref>McDowell, Edwin, [http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/09/specials/joyce-corrected.html "Corrected 'Ulysses' Sparks Scholarly Attack"], The New York Times, 15 June 1988</ref> replaced the Gabler edition with its 1961 version, and in the United Kingdom the Bodley Head press revived its 1960 version. In both the UK and USA, [[Everyman's Library]] also republished the 1960 ''Ulysses''. In 1992, [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] dropped Gabler and reprinted the 1960 text. The Gabler version remained available from Vintage International. Reprints of the 1922 first edition are also now widely available, largely due to the expiration of the copyright for that edition in the United States.  While much ink has been spilt over the faults and theoretical underpinnings of the Gabler edition, the long-awaited Kidd edition has yet to be published, {{as of|lc=y|2015}}. In 1992 W. W. Norton announced that a Kidd edition of ''Ulysses'' was to be published as part of a series called "The Dublin Edition of the Works of James Joyce". This book had to be withdrawn, however, when the Joyce estate objected. The estate refused to authorise any further editions of Joyce's work for the immediate future, but signed a deal with Wordsworth Editions to bring out a bargain version of the novel in January 2010, ahead of copyright expiration in 2012.<ref>{{cite web | last = Max | first = D.T. | title = The Injustice Collector |work=The New Yorker | date = 19 June 2006  | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/19/060619fa_fact | accessdate = 2009-03-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Battles | first = Jan | title = Budget Ulysses to flood the market |work=The Sunday Times | date = 9 August 2009  | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6788825.ece | accessdate = 2009-11-30 | location=London}}</ref>  ==Literary significance and critical reception== In a review in ''[[The Dial]]'', [[T. S. Eliot]] said of ''Ulysses'':  "I hold this book to be the most important expression which the present age has found; it is a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape." He went on to assert that Joyce was not at fault if people after him did not understand it:  "The next generation is responsible for its own soul; a man of genius is responsible to his peers, not to a studio full of uneducated and undisciplined coxcombs."<ref>Eliot, T.

''Time'' magazine</ref>  [[Stuart Gilbert]] said that the "personages of ''Ulysses'' are ''not'' fictitious",<ref>Gilbert (1930), p. 21.</ref> but that "these people are as they must be; they act, we see, according to some ''lex eterna'', an ineluctable condition of their very existence".<ref name="Gilbert 1930, p. 22">Gilbert (1930), p. 22.</ref> Through these characters Joyce "achieves a coherent and integral interpretation of life".<ref name="Gilbert 1930, p. 22" />  Joyce uses metaphors, symbols, ambiguities, and overtones which gradually link themselves together so as to form a network of connections binding the whole work.<ref name =Blamires/>  This system of connections gives the novel a wide, more universal significance, as "Leopold Bloom becomes a modern Ulysses, an Everyman in a Dublin which becomes a microcosm of the world."<ref>''Routledge History of Literature in English''</ref>  Eliot described this system as the "mythic method": "a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history".<ref>Armstrong, Tim (2005).

While the song includes allusions and themes not obviously related, clear references are made to numerous characters and situations from the novel. Notably, while Molly's soliloquy in the book ends in the affirmative, Grace's "Molly", having mused over the conditions of her life in a way similar to Joyce's, concludes with the stoically despairing "it all falls apart."  The song "[[Flower of the Mountain]]" by [[Kate Bush]] (originally the eponymous track off ''The Sensual World'') sets to music the end of Molly Bloom's soliloquy.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2011/04/kate-bush-finally-gets-to-record-james-joyce.html |  title = After 22 years, Kate Bush gets to record James Joyce | first = Carolyn | last= Kellogg | date = 6 April 2011 | accessdate = 29 July 2013 | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>  The Joyce novel is mentioned in the lyrics of the title track of ''Ulysses'', a 2014 album by Canadian indie rock band [[Current Swell]]. The album cover art is also an homage to the first edition cover of the book. The novel is also directly alluded to by indie folk singer [[Mason Jennings]] in his song entitled "Ulysses", on his 2004 album ''Use Your Voice''.  ===Prose=== Jacob Appel's novel, ''The Biology of Luck'' (2013), is a retelling of ''Ulysses'' set in New York City.  The novel features an inept tour guide, Larry Bloom, whose adventures parallel those of Leopold Bloom through Dublin.  == Notes == {{Reflist|30em}}  == References == * {{cite journal   | last = Beebe   | first = Maurice   | title = ''Ulysses'' and the Age of Modernism   | journal = [[James Joyce Quarterly]]   | volume = 10   | issue = 1   | pages = 172–88   | publisher = [[University of Tulsa]]   | date = Fall 1972   | issn =  }} * Borach, Georges.
