     Errol Leslie Thomson Flynn (20 June 1909 – 14 October 1959) was an Australian-American actor.Obituary Variety, 21 October 1959, pg. 87.  He was known for his romantic swashbuckler roles in Hollywood films.  Flynn was born in Hobart, Tasmania, where his father, Theodore Thomson Flynn, was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of biology at the University of Tasmania. Flynn was born at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Battery Point. His mother was born Lily Mary Young, but dropped the first names Lily Mary shortly after she was married and changed her name to Marelle.Flynn always calls her Marelle in his autobiography. Flynn described his mother's family as "seafaring folk"Flynn, My Wicked, Wicked Ways, p. 33. and this appears to be where his lifelong interest in boats and the sea originated. Despite Flynn's claims, the evidence indicates that he was not descended from any of the Bounty mutineers. Married at St. John's Church of England, Birchgrove, Sydney, on 23 January 1909, both of his parents were native-born Australians of Irish, English and Scottish descent.Flynn, My Wicked, Wicked Ways, p. 25. After early schooling in Hobart, from 1923 to 1925 Flynn was educated at the South West London College, a private boarding school in Barnes, London,Bardrick, Ajax (2008) 'Errol Flynn's Barnes Period', published by 'the-vu' and in 1926 returned to Australia to attend Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore School)Moore, John Hammond: "Young Errol Flynn before Hollywood", 1975; ISBN 0-207-13158-9 where he was the classmate of a future Australian prime minister, John Gorton. He concluded his formal education with being expelled from Shore for theft,Moore, John Hammond 'The Young Errol Flynn Before Hollywood' (2nd Edition, 2011), Trafford Publishing and—according to his own account—having been caught in a romantic assignation with the school's laundress. After being dismissed from a job as a junior clerk with a Sydney shipping company for pilfering petty cash, he went to Papua New Guinea at the age of eighteen, seeking and failing to find his fortune in tobacco planting and metals mining. He spent the next five years oscillating between the New Guinea frontier territory and Sydney. In early 1933, Flynn appeared as an amateur actor in the Australian film In the Wake of the Bounty, in the lead role of Fletcher Christian. Later that year he returned to Britain to pursue a career in acting, and soon secured a job with the Northampton Repertory Company at the town's Royal Theatre (now part of Royal & Derngate), where he worked and received his training as a professional actor for seven months. Northampton is home to an art-house cinema named after him, the Errol Flynn Filmhouse. He performed at the 1934 Malvern Festival and in Glasgow, and briefly in London's West End. In 1934 Flynn was dismissed from Northampton Rep. after he threw a female stage manager down a stairwell. He returned to Warner Brothers' Teddington Studios in Middlesex where he had worked as an extra in the film I Adore You before going to Northampton.Connelly, Gerry. Errol Flynn in Northampton (1998) With his new-found acting skills he was cast as the lead in Murder at Monte Carlo (currently a lost film). During its filming he was signed by Warner Bros. and emigrated to the U.S. as a contract actor.  Flynn was an immediate sensation in his first starring Hollywood role,Caterson, Simon, "Errol Flynn, man in tights", onlineopinion.com.au, 10 June 2009; retrieved 14 June 2012 Captain Blood (1935). Typecast as a swashbuckler, he helped to re-invent the action-adventure genre with a succession of films over the next six years, most under the direction of Michael Curtiz: The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936),The Prince and the Pauper (1937), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938; his first Technicolor film), The Dawn Patrol (1938), Dodge City (1939), The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939) and The Sea Hawk (1940). In collaboration with Hollywood's best fight arrangers, Flynn became noted for fast-paced sword fights, beginning with The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Sea Hawk and Captain Blood. He demonstrated an acting range beyond action-adventure roles in light contemporary social comedies (The Perfect Specimen (1937) and Four's a Crowd (1938)), and melodrama (The Sisters (1938)). During this period Flynn published his first book, Beam Ends (1937), an autobiographical account of his sailing experiences around Australia as a youth. He also travelled to Spain, in 1937, as a war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War.Tasmanian Devil: The Fast and Furious Life of Errol Flynn, flamingstarfilms.com.au; retrieved 23 May 2012. Flynn co-starred with Olivia de Havilland a total of eight times, and together they made the most successful on-screen romantic partnership in Hollywood in the late 1930s-early 1940s in Captain Blood (1935), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Four's a Crowd (1938), Dodge City (1939), The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), Santa Fe Trail (1940) and They Died with Their Boots On (1941). While Flynn acknowledged his personal attraction to de Havilland, assertions by film historians that they were romantically involved during the filming of Robin HoodRudy Behlmer in the Special Edition release of Robin Hood (2003) were denied by de Havilland. "Yes, we did fall in love and I believe that this is evident in the screen chemistry between us", she told an interviewer in 2009. "But his circumstances [Flynn's marriage to actress Lili Damita] at the time prevented the relationship going further. I have not talked about it a great deal but the relationship was not consummated. Chemistry was there though. It was there."Leach, B (17 June 2009). Gone With The Wind star confirms one of Hollywood's most talked-about romances. The Telegraph; retrieved 15 September 2015.  Flynn's relationship with Bette Davis, his co-star in The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), was quarrelsome; Davis allegedly slapped him across the face far harder than necessary during one scene. Flynn attributed her anger to unrequited romantic interest; but according to others, Davis resented sharing equal billing with a man she considered incapable of playing any role beyond a dashing adventurer. "He himself openly said, 'I don't know really anything about acting'", she told an interviewer, "and I admire his honesty, because he's absolutely right."Spada, J. More Than a Woman: An Intimate Biography of Bette Davis. Bantam (1993), p. 143; ISBN 0553095129.  Years later, however, de Havilland recounted that during a private screening of Elizabeth and Essex, an astounded Davis exclaimed, "Damn it! The man could act!"Matzen, R.

In 1940, at the zenith of his career, Flynn was voted the fourth most popular star in the US and the seventh most popular in Britain.  He was a member of the Hollywood Cricket Club with David Niven, and a talented tennis player on the California club circuit. His suave, debonair, devil-may-care attitude was characterised as "Errolesque" by author Benjamin S. Johnson in his treatise, An Errolesque Philosophy on Life.My Wicked, Wicked Ways (essay), errolflynn.net; accessed 22 September 2015. Flynn became a naturalised American citizen on 14 August 1942. As the United States had by then entered the Second World War, he attempted to enlist in the armed services, but failed the physical exam due to multiple heart problems (including at least one heart attack), recurrent malaria (contracted in New Guinea), chronic back pain (self-medicated with morphine and later, heroin), chronic tuberculosis and numerous venereal diseases.Basinger, Jeanine: The Star Machine, p. 247. This created an image problem for both Flynn, the supposed paragon of male physical prowess, and for Warner Brothers, which continued to cast him in athletic roles, including such patriotic productions as Dive Bomber (1941), Desperate Journey (1942) and Objective, Burma! (1945).Thomas, Tony. Errol Flynn: The Spy Who Never Was Despite widespread criticism, Flynn's failure to join other Hollywood stars in military service was never explained by the studio, which had no desire to publicise the health problems of one of its most valuable assets. In 1946 Flynn published an adventure novel, Showdown. He earned a reported $184,000 for the year of 1946.M'CAREY'S WAGE OF $1,113,035 YEAR'S HIGHEST: Treasury Report Places Film Producer First, Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) [Chicago, Ill] 17 June 1946: 6. After the Second World War the taste of the American moviegoing audience changed from European-themed material and the English history-based escapist epics in which Flynn excelled to more gritty, urban realism and film noir, reflecting modern American life. Flynn tried unsuccessfully to make the transition in Uncertain Glory (1944) and Cry Wolf (1947), and then increasingly passe Westerns such as Silver River (1948) and Montana (1950). After he displayed his frustration with increasingly disruptive behavior during filming, he was released from his contract in 1950 by Jack L. Warner as part of a stable-clearing of 1930s glamour generation stars. His Hollywood career over at the age of 41, Flynn entered a steep financial and physical decline. In the 1950s, after losing his savings from the Hollywood years in a series of financial disasters, including The Story of William Tell (1954), he became a parody of himself, sailing aimlessly around the Western Mediterranean aboard his yacht . Heavy alcohol abuse left him prematurely aged and overweight. He staved off financial ruin with roles in forgettable productions such as King's Rhapsody (1955) in the UK's failing film industry, Hello God (1951) and Crossed Swords (1954). He performed in such also-ran Hollywood films as Mara Maru (1952) and Istanbul (1957), and made occasional television appearances.'Errol Flynn', 'Secret Lives Series' (1996), documentary made for Channel 4 Television by Hart-Ryan Productions, Britain. As early as 1952 he had been seriously ill with hepatitis resulting in liver damage.Flynn, Errol My Wicked, Wicked Ways (1959) p. 14 In 1956 he presented and sometimes performed in the television anthology series The Errol Flynn Theatre that was filmed in Britain. He enjoyed a brief revival of popularity with The Sun Also Rises (1957); The Big Boodle (1957), filmed in Cuba; Too Much, Too Soon (1958); and The Roots of Heaven (1958). He met with Stanley Kubrick to discuss a role in Lolita, but nothing came of it. Flynn went to Cuba in late 1958 to film the self-produced B film Cuban Rebel Girls, where he met Fidel Castro and was initially an enthusiastic supporter of the Cuban Revolution. He wrote a series of newspaper and magazine articles for the New York Journal American and other publications documenting his time in Cuba with Castro. Many of these pieces were lost until 2009, when they were rediscovered in a collection at the University of Texas at Austin's Center for American History. He narrated a short film titled Cuban Story: The Truth About Fidel Castro Revolution (1959), his last known work as an actor. Flynn developed a reputation for womanising, hard drinking, and for a time in the 1940s, narcotics abuse. The expression "in like Flynn" is said to have been coined to refer to the supreme ease with which he reputedly seduced women, though there is dispute about its origin.McNulty, T. Errol Flynn: The Life and Career. McFarland (2011), p. 143; ASIN B00OYV18WU. Flynn was reportedly fond of the expression, and later claimed that he wanted to call his memoir In Like Me. (The publisher insisted on a more tasteful title, My Wicked, Wicked Ways.)Caterson, Simon, "Genius for living driven by lust for death", Australian Literary Review, 3 June 2009; retrieved 6 June 2009.ERROL FLYNN PROFILE, tcm.com; retrieved 23 May 2012. His lifestyle caught up with him in 1942 when two under-age girls, Betty Hansen and Peggy Satterlee, accused him of statutory rape at the Bel Air home of Flynn's friend Frederick McEvoy and on board Flynn's yacht, respectively.Host Sued For Divorce, The Advertiser, 28 October 1942, retrieved 26 October 2011. The scandal received immense press attention. Many of Flynn's fans, assuming that his screen persona was a reflection of his actual personality, refused to accept that the charges were true. Some founded organisations to publicly protest the accusation. (One such group, the American Boys' Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn—ABCDEF—accumulated a substantial membership that included William F. Buckley, Jr.)Valenti, Peter Errol Flynn: A Bio-Bibliography, p. 141. The trial took place in late January and early February 1943; Flynn's attorney, Jerry Giesler, impugned the women's character and morals, and accused them of numerous indiscretions, including affairs with married men and abortions.Higgins, B. Errol Flynn Stood Trial for Statutory Rape in 1934. Hollywood Reporter archive; retrieved 14 September 2015. Flynn was acquitted, but the trial's widespread coverage and lurid overtones permanently damaged his carefully cultivated screen image as an idealised romantic lead player.Valenti, Peter Errol Flynn: A Bio-Bibliography, pp. 143-46.  Flynn was married three times: to actress Lili Damita from 1935 until 1942 (one son, Sean Flynn, 31 May 1941-disappeared MIA 1971); to Nora Eddington from 1943-49 (two daughters, Deirdre, born 1945, and Rory, born 1947); and to actress Patrice Wymore from 1950 until his death (one daughter, Arnella Roma, 1953–98). In Hollywood, he tended to refer to himself as Irish rather than Australian (his father Theodore Thomson Flynn had been a biologist and a professor at the Queen's University of Belfast in Northern Ireland during the latter part of his career). After quitting Hollywood, Flynn lived with Wymore in Port Antonio, Jamaica in the early 1950s. He was largely responsible for developing tourism to this area and for a while owned the Titchfield Hotel which was decorated by the artist Olga Lehmann. He popularised trips down rivers on bamboo rafts. Flynn was a longtime friend of the painter Boris Smirnoff, who painted his portrait several times, as well as those of Lili Damita, Patrice Wymore and celebrity friends such as Edward G. Robinson, Jean Harlow, Norma Shearer and Barbara Stanwyck.Napier-Ford, Noel: Smirnoff biography for Sir Peter Michael's restaurant "The Vineyard", the-vineyard.co.uk; accessed 22 September 2015. The gossips took note of his close friendships with Lupe Vélez, Marlene Dietrich, Dolores del Río and Carole Lombard. Lombard is said to have resisted his advances. She had already met and fallen in love with Clark Gable, but she liked Flynn and invited him to her extravagant soirees.Thomas McNulty, Errol Flynn: The Life and Career His only son, Sean (born 31 May 1941), was an actor and war correspondent.

As Caldough was driving Flynn and the young actress Beverly Aadland, who had accompanied him on the trip, to the airport on 14 October for a Los Angeles-bound flight, Flynn began complaining of severe pain in his back and legs. Caldough transported him to the residence of a doctor, Grant Gould, who noted that Flynn had considerable difficulty negotiating the building's stairway. Gould, assuming that the pain was due to degenerative disc disease and spinal osteoarthritis, administered 50 milligrams of demerol intravenously. As Flynn's discomfort diminished, he "reminisced at great length about his past experiences" to those present. He refused a drink when offered it.Letter to Vancouver coroner from Dr. Grant Gould, MD.

Flynn responded that he felt "ever so much better". After 20&nbsp;minutes Aadland checked on Flynn and discovered him unresponsive. Despite immediate emergency medical treatment from Gould and a swift transferral by ambulance to Vancouver General Hospital, he did not regain consciousness and was pronounced dead that evening.

In 1961, Beverly Aadland's mother, Florence, co-wrote The Big Love with Tedd Thomey, alleging that Flynn had been involved in a sexual relationship with her daughter, who was 15 at the time. The book was later made into a play starring Tracey Ullman as Florence Aadland. In 1980, author Charles Higham published a controversial biography, Errol Flynn: The Untold Story, in which he alleged that Flynn was a fascist sympathiser who spied for the Nazis before and during the Second World War, and that he was bisexual and had affairs with Tyrone Power, Howard Hughes, and Truman Capote. The author accused Flynn of arranging to have Dive Bomber filmed on location at the San Diego Naval Base for the benefit of Japanese military planners, who needed information on American warships and defense installations. Higham later admitted to the New York Times that he had no documents proving Flynn was a Nazi agent.Biographer Charles Higham, who wrote about Errol Flynn, dies, winnipegfreepress.com; retrieved 23 May 2012.

In a 2000 article Higham repeated his Nazi collaboration accusations, and also linked Flynn with Dr. Hermann Erben, an Austrian who served in German military intelligence. Subsequent biographers—notably Tony Thomas (Errol Flynn: The Spy Who Never Was) and Buster Wiles (My Days With Errol Flynn: The Autobiography of a Stuntman)—rejected Higham's claims as pure fabrication. They accused him of altering FBI documents in an attempt to validate his allegations."Charles Higham, who has died aged 81, was a much-feared and notoriously bitchy celebrity biographer whose works fell squarely in the 'unauthorised' category", telegraph.co.uk; retrieved 23 May 2012. Flynn's political leanings, they said, appear to have been leftist: he supported the Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War and, for a time, the Cuban Revolution. In 2000 the British Home Office released MI5 files suggesting that Flynn worked for the Allies during the war. Flynn reportedly volunteered for espionage duties in Ireland, but was turned down because of FDR's fear that he sympathised with the Nazis. In Errol Flynn: Satan's Angel (2000), David Bret also alleged that Flynn was bisexual, but denounced the Nazi charges.Bret, David. Errol Flynn: Satan's Angel (2000) In a 1982 interview with Penthouse magazine, Ronald DeWolf, son of the author L. Ron Hubbard, said that his father's friendship with Flynn was so strong that Hubbard's family considered Flynn an adoptive father to DeWolf. He claimed that Flynn and his father engaged in illegal activities together, including drug smuggling and sexual acts with under-age girls; but Flynn never joined Hubbard's religious group, Scientology.
