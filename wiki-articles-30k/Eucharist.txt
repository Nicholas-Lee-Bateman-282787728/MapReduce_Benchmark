    The Eucharist  (also called Holy Communion, the Lord's Supper, and other names) is a rite considered by most Christian churches to be a sacrament. According to the New Testament, it was instituted by Jesus Christ during his Last Supper. Giving his disciples bread and wine during the Passover meal, Jesus commanded his followers to "do this in memory of me" while referring to the bread as "my body" and the wine as "my blood".Ignazio Silone, Bread and Wine (1937). Through the Eucharistic celebration Christians remember Christ's sacrifice of himself once and for all on the cross. Christians generally recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite, though they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present. While all agree that there is no perceptible change in the elements, some believe that they actually become the body and blood of Christ, others believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present in, with, and under the bread and wine (whose reality remains unchanged), others believe in a "real" but merely spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and still others take the act to be only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper. Some Protestants view the Eucharist as an ordinance in which the ceremony is seen not as a specific channel of divine grace, but as an expression of faith and of obedience to Christ. In spite of differences between Christians about various aspects of the Eucharist, there is, according to the Encyclopædia Britannica, "more of a consensus among Christians about the meaning of the Eucharist than would appear from the confessional debates over the sacramental presence, the effects of the Eucharist, and the proper auspices under which it may be celebrated."Encyclopædia Britannica, s.v. Eucharist The word Eucharist may refer not only to the rite but also to the consecrated bread (leavened or unleavened) and wine (or grape juice) used in the rite. In this sense, communicants (that is, those who partake of the communion elements) may speak of "receiving the Eucharist", as well as "celebrating the Eucharist". The Greek noun εὐχαριστία (eucharistia), meaning "thanksgiving", is not used in the New Testament as a name for the rite; however, the related verb is found in New Testament accounts of the Last Supper,Thomas R. Schreiner, Matthew R. Crawford, The Lord's Supper (B&H Publishing Group 2011 ISBN 978-0-8054-4757-6), p. 156John H.

Duke, The New Westminister Dictionary of Church History (Westminster John Knox Press 2008 ISBN 978-0-664-22416-5), vol. 2, p. 231 including the earliest such account:  For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me". (1 Corinthians 11:23-24)  The term "Eucharist" (thanksgiving) is that by which the rite is referred by the Didache (late 1st or early 2nd century),Eucharist in the New Testament by Jerome Kodell 1988 ISBN 0-8146-5663-3 p. 51Introducing Early Christianity by Laurie Guy ISBN 0-8308-3942-9 p. 196Didache 9:1 (pp. 22-23)Theological Dictionary of the New Testament by Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich and Geoffrey W.

Other Protestant denominations rarely use this term, preferring either "Communion", "the Lord's Supper", or "the Breaking of Bread".  The Lord's Supper, in Greek Κυριακὸν δεῖπνον (Kyriakon deipnon), was in use in the early 50s of the 1st century, as witnessed by the First Epistle to the Corinthians (11:20-21): When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. Those mentioned above in relation to the term "Eucharist" rarely use the expression "the Lord's Supper", but it is the predominant term among Baptist groups, who generally avoid using the term "Communion", and is preferred also by some evangelical Anglicans and Methodists.  Communion or Holy Communion are used by some groups originating in the Protestant Reformation to mean the entire Eucharistic rite. Others, such as the Catholic Church, do not use this term for the rite, but instead mean by it the act of partaking of the consecrated elements: they speak of receiving Holy Communion even outside of the rite, and of participating in the rite without receiving Holy Communion. The term "Communion" is derived from Latin communio ("sharing in common"), which translates Greek κοινωνία (koinōnía) in : The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?.   The Last Supper appears in all three Synoptic Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke. It also is found in the First Epistle to the Corinthians,Tyndale Bible Dictionary / editors, Philip W. Comfort, Walter A. Elwell, 2001 ISBN 0-8423-7089-7, article: Lord's Supper, TheOxford Dictionary of the Christian Church / editors, F. L. Cross & E. A. Livingstone 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3, article Eucharist which suggests how early Christians celebrated what Paul the Apostle called the Lord's Supper. Although the Gospel of John does not reference the Last Supper explicitly, some argue that it contains theological allusions to the early Christian celebration of the Eucharist, especially in the chapter 6 Bread of Life Discourse but also in other passages. In his First Epistle to the Corinthians (c 54-55), Paul the Apostle gives the earliest recorded description of Jesus' Last Supper: "The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me. Those interested might note that the Greek word for remembrance is ἀνάμνησιν or "anamnesis," which itself has a much richer theological history than the English word for "remember." The liturgical setting of the passage (a pastoral letter to an early Christian congregation) implies that Paul is referencing an already-present eucharistic-type practice among early believers. If this is true, it should also be kept in mind as contextual background to the later Gospel accounts (below). {{Expand section|1= * more from the Synoptic gospels |date=September 2014}}  The synoptic gospels, {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:22-25}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:26-29|NIV}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:13-20|NIV}}, depict Jesus as presiding over the Last Supper.

The consecration of the bread (known as the [[Host (Holy Communion)|host]]) and wine represents the separation of Jesus's body from his blood at [[Calvary]]. However, since he has risen, the Church teaches that his body and blood can no longer be truly separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or [[extraordinary minister of Holy Communion]]) says "the body of Christ" when administering the host and "the blood of Christ" when presenting the chalice, the communicant who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire.  [[File:BentoXVI-51-11052007 (frag).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] celebrates a Mass.]] The Catholic Church sees as the main basis for this belief the words of Jesus himself at his Last Supper: the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:26-28|NAB}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:22-24|NAB}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:19-20|NAB}}) and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul's]]  {{bibleref2|1cor|11:23-25||1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;11:23-25}}) recount that in that context Jesus said of what to all appearances were bread and wine: "This is my body … this is my blood."

In his 1968 ''[[Credo of the People of God]]'', he reiterated that any theological explanation of the doctrine must hold to the twofold claim that, after the consecration, 1) Christ's body and blood are really present; and 2) bread and wine are really absent; and this presence and absence is ''real'' and not merely something in the mind of the believer.  On entering a church, [[Latin Church]] Catholics [[genuflect]] to the [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] that holds the consecrated host in order to respectfully acknowledge the presence of Jesus in the [[Blessed Sacrament]], a presence to which a [[votive candle]] or [[sanctuary lamp]] kept burning close to such a tabernacle draws attention.  ===Eastern Christianity=== [[File:Liturgy St James 1.jpg|thumb|Eucharistic elements prepared for the Divine Liturgy.]] {{Main|Divine Liturgy}} Among Eastern Christians, the Eucharistic service is called the ''Divine Liturgy'' ([[Byzantine Rite]]) or similar names in other rites. It comprises two main divisions: the first is the ''Liturgy of the Catechumens'' which consists of introductory litanies, antiphons and scripture readings, culminating in a reading from one of the [[Gospels]] and, often, a [[homily]]; the second is the ''Liturgy of the Faithful'' in which the Eucharist is offered, consecrated, and received as Holy Communion. Within the latter, the actual Eucharistic prayer is called the ''[[anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]], '' literally: "offering" or "carrying up" ({{lang|grc|ἀνα- + φέρω}}). In the [[Rite of Constantinople]], two different anaphoras are currently used: one is attributed to Saint [[John Chrysostom]], the other to [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil the Great]]. Among the [[Oriental Orthodox]], a variety of anaphoras are used, but all are similar in structure to those of the Constantinopolitan Rite, in which the Anaphora of Saint John Chrysostom is used most days of the year; Saint Basil's is offered on the Sundays of [[Great Lent]], the eves of [[Christmas]] and [[Theophany]], [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], [[Holy Saturday]], and upon his feast day (1 January). At the conclusion of the Anaphora the bread and wine are held to be the Body and Blood of Christ. Unlike the Latin Church, the [[Byzantine Rite]] uses leavened bread, with the leaven symbolizing the presence of the Holy Spirit.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zSXu17g7BRwC&pg=PA90#v=onepage&q&f=false Steven Runciman, The Great Church in Captivity (Cambridge University Press 1968 ISBN 0-521-31310-4), p. 90]</ref> The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], like the Latin Church, uses unleavened bread.  Conventionally this change in the elements is understood to be accomplished at the ''[[Epiclesis]]'' ([[Greek language|Greek:]] "invocation") by which the [[Holy Spirit]] is invoked and the [[consecration]] of the bread and wine as the true and genuine Body and Blood of Christ is specifically requested, but since the anaphora as a whole is considered a unitary (albeit lengthy) prayer, no one moment within it can be readily singled out.  ===Anglican=== {{Main|Anglican Eucharistic theology}}Unlike that of many Protestant traditions, Anglican Eucharistic theology is not [[Memorialism|memorialist]] (the belief that nothing special happens at the Lord's Supper other than devotional reflection on Christ's death). However, since the [[English Reformation]] it has also historically distinguished itself from the Catholic doctrine of [[transubstantiation]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Anglicans Online {{!}} The Thirty-Nine Articles, Article XXVIII "Of the Lord's Supper"|url = http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html|website = anglicansonline.org|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}</ref> [[Receptionism]], which teaches that Christ is only present in the Eucharist to the person who receives him in faith, has been a common but not universal stance within post-Reformation Anglicanism. However, certain strains of Anglo-Catholicism, who largely trace their roots back to the [[Oxford Movement]], believe the Anglican tradition should be seen as more closely connected to the Catholic tradition from which it sprang, and therefore hold views that come closer to transubstantiation.{{see also|Book of Common Prayer}} In most churches of the [[Anglican Communion]], the Eucharist is celebrated every Sunday, having replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service. The rites for the Eucharist are found in the various [[Book of Common Prayer|prayer books]] of [[Anglican]] churches. Wine and unleavened wafers or leavened bread is used. Daily celebrations are the norm in many [[cathedral]]s and parish churches typically offer one or more Eucharists during the week. Only a small minority of parishes with a priest do not celebrate the Eucharist at least once each Sunday. The nature of the ceremony, however, varies according to the theological orientation of the priest, parish, [[diocese]] or regional church.  ===Protestant=== {{Overly detailed|date=April 2015|section=yes}}  ====Baptist==== [[File:Communion Baptist.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Serving of elements individually, to be taken in unison, is common among Baptists]] The bread and "fruit of the vine" indicated in Matthew, Mark and Luke as the elements of the ''Lord's Supper''<ref>{{bibleref|Matthew|26:26–29}}, {{bibleref|Mark|14:22–25}}, {{bibleref|Luke|22:19}}</ref> are interpreted by many [[Baptists]] as unleavened bread (although leavened bread is often used) and, in line with the historical stance of some Baptist groups (since the mid-19th century) against partaking of alcoholic beverages, [[grape juice]], which they commonly refer to simply as "the Cup".<ref>See, e.g., {{cite book | first=J. R. | last=Graves | year=1928 | title=What is It to Eat and Drink Unworthily | publisher=Baptist Sunday School Committee | oclc=6323560}}</ref> The unleavened bread also underscores the symbolic belief attributed to Christ's breaking the bread and saying that it was his body. A [[saltine cracker|soda cracker]] is often used.  Most Baptists do not consider the Communion or its elements to be sacramental; rather, it is considered to be an act of remembrance of Christ's atonement, and a time of renewal of personal commitment.   However, with the rise of [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]], many Baptists have denied memorialism as a 19th-century doctrinal novelty, and have taken up a Reformed view of Communion.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Confessional Baptists believe in pneumatic presence, which is expressed in the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|Second London Baptist Confession]], specifically in Chapter 30, Articles 3 and 7. This view is prevalent among [[Southern Baptists]], those in the Founders movement (a Calvinistic movement within the some [[Independent Baptists]], [[Freewill Baptists]], and several individuals in other Baptist associations.  Communion practices and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice is to have small cups of juice and plates of broken bread distributed to the seated congregation. In other congregations, communicants may proceed to the altar to receive the elements, then return to their seats. A widely accepted practice is for all to receive and hold the elements until everyone is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, music is performed and Scripture is read during the receiving of the elements.  Some Baptist churches are closed-Communionists (even requiring full membership in the church before partaking), with others being partially or fully open-Communionists. It is rare to find a Baptist church where The Lord's Supper is observed every Sunday; most observe monthly or quarterly, with some holding Communion only during a designated Communion service or following a worship service.  ====Lutheran==== [[File:EucharistELCA.JPG|right|thumb|Table set for the Eucharist in an ELCA service]] {{Main|Eucharist in Lutheranism}} {{see also|Divine Service (Lutheran)}} [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]s believe that the body and blood of Christ are "truly and substantially present in, with, and under the forms" of the consecrated bread and wine (the elements), so that communicants eat and drink the body and blood of Christ himself as well as the bread and wine in this [[Lutheran sacraments|sacrament]].<ref>[[Augsburg Confession]], Article 10</ref> The Lutheran doctrine of the Real Presence is more accurately and formally known as the "[[sacramental union]]".

In the more modern groups, Communion is only the serving of the Lord’s Supper. In the communion meal, the members of the Mennonite churches renew their covenant with God and with each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/O745ME.html |title=Ordinances |publisher=GAMEO |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>  ====Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren==== Among [[Open Brethren|Open]] assemblies, also termed [[Plymouth Brethren]], the Eucharist is more commonly called the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper. It is seen as a symbolic memorial and entirely non-sacramental and central to the worship of both individual and assembly.<ref name="Darby">Darby, J.N., quoted in Bradshaw, P.F. ''The new SCM dictionary of liturgy and worship'', p.375</ref> In principle, the service is open to all [[baptism|baptized]] Christians, but an individual's eligibility to participate depends on the views of each particular assembly. The service takes the form of non-liturgical, open worship with all male participants allowed to pray audibly and select hymns or readings. The breaking of bread itself typically consists of one leavened loaf, which is prayed over and broken by a participant in the meeting<ref>Muller, G. (1860) ''A Narrative of some of the Lords dealings with George Muller'', pp.279-281</ref> and then shared around. The wine is poured from a single container into one or several vessels, and these are again shared around.<ref>Bradshaw, P.F. ''The new SCM dictionary of liturgy and worship'', p.375</ref><ref>[http://www.brethrenonline.org/faqs/Brethren.htm Brethren Online FAQs]</ref>  The [[Exclusive Brethren]] follow a similar practice to the [[Open Brethren]]. They also call the Eucharist the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper.<ref name="Darby" />  ====Reformed/Presbyterian==== In the [[Reformed Churches]] the Eucharist is variously administered. The Calvinist view of the Sacrament sees a real presence of Christ in the supper which differs both from the objective ontological presence of the Catholic view, and from the real absence of Christ and the mental recollection of the memorialism of the Zwinglians<ref>McGrath, Alister E. ''Reformation Thought'' Oxford: Blackwell (2003) p.189</ref> and their successors.  [[File:South Leith communion token reverse.jpg|thumb|150px|Many Presbyterian churches historically used [[communion token]]s to provide entrance to the Lord's Supper.]] The bread and wine become the means by which the believer has real communion with Christ in his death and Christ's body and blood are present to the faith of the believer as really as the bread and wine are present to their senses but this presence is "spiritual", that is the work of the Holy Spirit.<ref>Hendry, George S. ''The Westminster Confession for Today'' SCM (1960) p.232</ref> There is no standard frequency; John Calvin desired weekly communion, but the city council only approved monthly, and monthly celebration has become the most common practice in Reformed churches today.  Many, on the other hand, follow [[John Knox]] in celebration of the Lord's supper on a quarterly basis, to give proper time for reflection and inward consideration of one's own state and sin. Recently, Presbyterian and Reformed Churches have been considering whether to restore more frequent communion, including weekly communion in more churches, considering that infrequent communion was derived from a memorialist view of the Lord's Supper, rather than Calvin's view of the sacrament as a means of grace.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.opc.org/OS/html/V6/4l.html|title=The Lord’s Supper: How Often?|author=D. G. Hart and John R. Muether|journal=Ordained Servant|volume=6|issue=4|date=October 1997}}</ref> Some churches use bread without any raising agent (whether [[leaven]] or [[yeast]]), in view of the use of [[matzo|unleavened bread]] at [[Passover seder|Jewish Passover meals]], while others use any bread available.  The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], for instance, prescribes "bread common to the culture". Harking back to the [[regulative principle of worship]], the Reformed tradition had long eschewed coming forward to receive communion, preferring to have the elements distributed throughout the congregation by the presbyters (elders) more in the style of a shared meal. Wine and grape juice are both used, depending on the congregation.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}   Openness ranges between open communion (any believer may participate, e.g. the PCUSA) to closed (only members of the denomination may partake). Most Reformed churches would practice a balance between these, i.e., all believers who are united to a church of like faith and practice, and who are not living in sin, would be allowed to join in the Sacrament, sometimes with a requirement of pastoral or elder approval.  ====Methodist==== [[File:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|150px|thumb|right|A United Methodist minister consecrating the elements]] The ''Catechism for the use of the people called Methodists'' states that, "[in the Eucharist] Jesus Christ is [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|present]] with his worshipping people and gives himself to them as their Lord and Saviour".<ref name="Methcat" /> Methodist theology of this sacrament is reflected in one of the fathers of the movement, [[Charles Wesley]], who wrote a Eucharistic hymn with the following stanza:<ref name="AbrahamWatson2013"/>  :We need not now go up to Heaven, :To bring the long sought Saviour down; :Thou art to all already given, :Thou dost e’en now Thy banquet crown: :To every faithful soul appear, :And show Thy real presence here!<ref name="AbrahamWatson2013">{{cite book|last1=Abraham|first1=William J.|last2=Watson|first2=David F.|title=Key United Methodist Beliefs|accessdate=8 December 2015|year=2013|publisher=Abingdon Press|language=English |isbn=9781426756610|page=103-104|quote=Charles Wesley wrote a marvelous collection of hymns that offer an amazing vision of Christ's mysterious, yet real, presence in the bread and the wine.

Though the ritual is standardized, there is great variation amongst United Methodist churches, from typically high-church to low-church, in the enactment and style of celebration. Methodist clergy are not required to be vested when celebrating the Eucharist, though the [[alb]] and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] is common.  [[United Methodists]] in the United States are encouraged to celebrate the Eucharist every Sunday, though it is typically celebrated on the first Sunday of each month, while a few go as long as celebrating quarterly (a tradition dating back to the days of [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit rider]]s that served multiple churches). Communicants may receive standing, kneeling, or while seated. Gaining more wide acceptance is the practice of receiving by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). The most common alternative to intinction is for the communicants to receive the consecrated juice using small, individual, specially made glass or plastic cups known as communion cups.<ref>[http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product Communion Cups, 1000] from Broadman / Holman Church Supply.

Others, including [[Evangelical]] churches such as the [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)|Church of God]], [[Calvary Chapel]], and many forms of [[Baptist]], typically receive communion on a monthly or periodic basis. Many non-denominational Christians hold to the Biblical [[autonomy]] of local churches and have no universal requirement among congregations.  The [[Churches of Christ]], among others, use [[grape juice]] and unleavened wafers or unleavened bread and practice open communion.  ===Other Christian churches===  ====Syriac==== {{Main|Holy Qurbana}} '''Holy Qurbana''' or '''Qurbana Qadisha, ''' the "Holy Offering" or "Holy Sacrifice", refers to the Eucharist as celebrated according to the [[East Syrian Rite|East Syrian]] and [[West Syrian Rite|West Syrian traditions]] of [[Syriac Christianity]]. The main [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora]] of the East Syrian tradition is the [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari]], while that of the West Syrian tradition is the [[Liturgy of Saint James]]. Both are extremely old, going back at least to the third century, and are the oldest extant liturgies continually in use.  ====Seventh-day Adventists==== In the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] the Holy Communion service customarily is celebrated once per quarter. The service includes the ordinance of [[footwashing]] and the Lord’s Supper. Unleavened bread and unfermented (non-alcoholic) grape juice is used. [[Open communion]] is practised: all who have committed their lives to the Saviour may participate. The communion service must be conducted by an ordained pastor, minister or church elder.<ref>Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual, 17th edition, 2005, pp. 81-86.

Jehovah's Witnesses believe that [[144,000#Jehovah's Witnesses|only 144,000]] people will receive heavenly salvation and immortal life and thus spend eternity with God and Christ in heaven, as under-priests and co-rulers under [[Christ the King]] and [[High priest#Christianity|High Priest]], in [[God's Kingdom|Jehovah's Kingdom]]. Paralleling the [[anointing]] of kings and priests, they are referred to as the "anointed" class and are the only ones who should partake of the bread and wine.  They believe that the "[[other sheep]]" of Christ's flock also benefit from the [[ransom sacrifice]], and are respectful observers of the Lord's Supper Remembrance, with hope of receiving everlasting life in Paradise restored on a "New Earth".<ref name=jwbh>{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005155|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=207}}</ref>  The Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation and viewing among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread symbolizes and represents Jesus Christ's perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which redeems fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as "emblems") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]]; so not a literal presence of flesh and blood in the emblems, but that the emblems are simply symbolisms denoting spiritual realities.<ref name=jwbh /><ref>"Discerning What We Are — At Memorial Time", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1990, p. 16.</ref>  ====Latter-day Saints==== {{main|Sacrament (LDS Church)}} In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the "Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper",<ref>See, e.g., {{cite book |first= B.

The famed apologist [[Saint|St.]] [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 150) wrote: "No one else is permitted to partake of it, except one who believes our teaching to be true...." For the first several hundred years, non-members were forbidden even to be present at the sacramental ritual; visitors and [[catechumen]]s (those still undergoing instruction) were dismissed halfway through the Liturgy, after the Bible readings and sermon but before the Eucharistic rite. This ancient custom is still evident in the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]], where the Mass is divided into two parts; the Mass of the Catechumens, and the Mass of the Faithful. The [[Divine Liturgy]] of St. John Chrysostom, used in the [[Byzantine Rite]], still has a formula of dismissal of catechumens (not usually followed by any action) at this point.  Churches such as the Catholic and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Churches]] practice [[closed communion]] under normal circumstances. However, the Catholic Church allows administration of the Eucharist, at their spontaneous request, to properly disposed members of the eastern churches ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Church of the East]]) not in full communion with it and of other churches that the [[Holy See]] judges to be sacramentally in the same position as these churches; and in grave and pressing need, such as danger of death, it allows the Eucharist to be administered also to individuals who do not belong to these churches but who share the Catholic Church's faith in the reality of the Eucharist and have no access to a minister of their own community.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844]</ref> Some [[Protestant]] communities exclude non-members from Communion.

Some churches do not limit it to only members of the congregation, but to any person in attendance (regardless of Christian affiliation) who considers himself/herself to be a Christian.  Others require that the communicant be a baptized person, or a member of a church of that denomination or a denomination of "like faith and practice". Some Progressive Christian congregations offer communion to any individual who wishes to commemorate the life and teachings of Christ, regardless of religious affiliation.<ref>In most United Church of Christ local churches, the Communion Table is "open to all Christians who wish to know the presence of Christ and to share in the community of God's people".

The Catholic Church believes that the matter for the Eucharist must be wheaten bread and fermented wine from grapes: it holds that, if the gluten has been entirely removed, the result is not true wheaten bread,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/Liturgy/zlitur47.htm |title=Gluten-free Hosts |accessdate=2008-04-22 |last=McNamara |first= Father Edward |date=2004-09-14 |year=|month= |work= ZENIT International News Agency}}</ref> For celiacs, but not generally, it allows low-gluten bread.

For alcoholics, but not generally, it allows the use of [[mustum]] (grape juice in which fermentation has begun but has been suspended without altering the nature of the juice), and it holds that "since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the species, communion under the species of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. For pastoral reasons, this manner of receiving communion has been legitimately established as the most common form in the Latin rite."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1390]</ref>  As already indicated, the one exception is in the case of a priest celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant. The water that in the [[Latin Church]] is prescribed to be mixed with the wine must be only a relatively small quantity.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3A.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 924 §1]</ref> The practice of the [[Coptic Church]] is that the mixture should be two parts wine to one part water.<ref>[http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/thecopticchurch/sacraments/4_eucharist.html Sacrament of the Eucharist: Rite of Sanctification of the Chalice]</ref>  Many Protestant churches allow clergy and communicants to take [[mustum]] instead of wine. In addition to, or in replacement of wine, some churches offer grape juice which has been [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] to stop the fermentation process the juice naturally undergoes; de-alcoholized wine from which most of the alcohol has been removed (between 0.5% and 2% remains); or water.<ref>Compare John Howard Spahr, [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1605 I Smell the Cup], ''Christian Century'', 12 March 1974, pp. 257-259.</ref> Exclusive use of unfermented grape juice is common in [[Baptist]] churches, the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]], [[Churches of Christ]], [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)]] some [[Lutherans]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Pentecostals]], [[Evangelicals]], the [[Christian Missionary Alliance]], and other American [[Nondenominational Christianity|independent]] Protestant churches.,  ====Fear of transmission of diseases==== Risk of infectious disease transmission related to use of a common communion cup is low, to the point of being undetectable. No case of transmission of an infectious disease related to a common communion cup has ever been documented. The most likely diseases to be transmitted would be common viral illnesses such as the [[common cold]], but a study of 681 individuals found that taking communion up to daily from a common cup did not increase the risk of infection beyond that of those who did not attend services at all.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Risk of Infectious Disease Transmission from a Common Communion Cup |first=Lilia P. |last=Manangan |first2=Lynne M. |last2=Sehulster |first3=Linda |last3=Chiarello |first4=Dawn N. |last4=Simonds |first5=William R. |last5=Jarvis |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |date=October 1998 |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=538–539 |url= http://www.ntnl.org/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/470-common-cup-cdc |doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70029-x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pellerin | first1 = J. | last2 = Edmond | first2 = M.

This is in full accord with Catholic Church belief that communion under the form of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. However, the same measure has also been taken by churches that normally insist on the importance of receiving communion under both forms. This was done in 2009 by the [[Church of England]].<ref>[http://www.christiantoday.com/article/archbishops.advise.against.sharing.chalice.during.swine.flu.pandemic/23882.htm Archbishops advise against sharing chalice during swine flu pandemic]</ref>  Some fear contagion through the handling involved in distributing the hosts to the communicants, even if they are placed on the hand rather than on the tongue. Accordingly, some churches use mechanical wafer dispensers or "pillow packs" (communion wafers with wine inside them). While these methods of distributing communion are not accepted in Catholic Church parishes, one such church provides a mechanical dispenser to allow those intending to communicate to place in a bowl, without touching them by hand, the hosts for use in the celebration.<ref>{{cite web| first= Sumathi |last=Reddy |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704415104576065982762908782.html |title= Hands Off After Wafer Scare| publisher= Wall Street Journal| date=7 January 2011| accessdate=2012-10-12}}</ref>  ==See also== {{div col}} ;Eucharistic theology *[[Eucharistic theology]], [[Eucharistic theologies summarised]] *[[Eucharistic miracle]] *[[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]]  ;Liturgical worship *[[Holy Qurbana|Eastern Rite]] *[[Mass (liturgy)|Western Rite]] *[[Canon of the Mass]] *[[Anaphora (liturgy)|Eucharistic Prayers]] *[[Mass of Paul VI|Second Vatican Council changes]]  ;Eucharistic practice *[[Closed communion]] *[[Communion under both kinds]] *[[First Communion]] *[[Fraction (religion)]] *[[Intinction]] *[[Open communion]] *[[Sacramental wine]] *[[Thanksgiving after Communion]]  ;Views of different churches *[[Anglican Eucharistic theology]] *[[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)]] *[[Sacramental Union]] (Lutheran) *[[Transubstantiation]] (Catholicism)  ;Sacramental theology *[[Baptism]] *[[Sacrament]]  ;History *[[Origin of the Eucharist]] ([[The Last Supper]]) *[[Marburg Colloquy]] (1529) *[[Sacramentarians]] ([[Protestant Reformation]] period, approx. 16th Century) *''[[The Adoration of the Sacrament]]'' by Martin Luther (1523) *[[Confession Concerning Christ's Supper]] by Martin Luther (1528) *[[Ubiquitarians]] (1530 and 1540) *[[Receptionism]] (16th and 17th-century Anglicans) *[[Year of the Eucharist]] (2004–2005) *[[Host desecration]]  ;Others *[[Agape feast]] *[[Catholic social teaching]] *[[Catholic theology of the body]] *[[Perichoresis]] *[[Theophagy]] {{div col end}}  ==Notes== {{Reflist|group="note"}}  ==References== {{reflist|30em}}  ==Further reading== {{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}  :Bouyer, Louis.

It is the term used by the Plymouth Brethren. The "Blessed Sacrament" and the "Blessed Sacrament of the Altar" are common terms used by Catholics, Lutherans and some Anglicans (Anglo-Catholicism) for the consecrated elements, especially when reserved in a tabernacle. "Sacrament of the Altar" is in common use also among Lutherans. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the term "The Sacrament" is used of the rite. Mass is used in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, some Anglicans (Anglo-Catholicism), the Church of Sweden, the Church of Norway, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, and some other forms of Western Christianity. Among the many other terms used in the Catholic Church are "Holy Mass", "the Memorial of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the Lord", the "Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", and the "Holy Mysteries"., and  The term "Mass" is probably derived from the fact that the Roman rite celebrates the Eucharist with unleavened bread (in Hebrew: matstsah).  This explains why the Eastern Catholic Liturgies are never referred to as the "Mass".  Eastern rite Liturgies are celebrated with leavened bread.  Although the prevailing theory is that it is derived from the Latin word  (dismissal), a word used in the concluding formula of Mass in Latin: Ite, missa est ("Go; it is the dismissal"). The reverse is probably more likely.  The word 'dismissal' probably came about because the Mass signaled the time for the Catechumens to leave.  Thus, the term "Misa" came to imply a 'mission', because at the end of the Mass the congregation are sent out to serve Christ. This term is used in Byzantine Rite traditions, whether in the Eastern Orthodox Church or among the Eastern Catholic Churches. These also speak of "the Divine Mysteries", especially in reference to the consecrated elements, which they also call "the Holy Gifts".Within Oriental Orthodoxy, the "Oblation" is the term used in the Syrian, Coptic and Armenian churches, while "Consecration" is used in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. "Oblation" and "Consecration" are of course used also by the Eastern Catholic Churches that are of the same liturgical tradition as these churches. Likewise, in the Gaelic language of Ireland and Scotland the word "Aifreann", usually translated into English as "Mass", is derived from Late Latin "Offerendum", meaning "oblation", "offering". This is the title for the liturgy in Lutheran churches and is used by most conservative Lutheran churches to refer to the Eucharistic liturgy.
