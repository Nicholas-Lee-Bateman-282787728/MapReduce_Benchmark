She has campaigned against the implementation of the WTO 1994 Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, which broadens the scope of patents to include life forms. Shiva has criticised the agreement as having close ties with the corporate sector and opening the door to further patents on life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/global/vshiva4_int.html|title=Interview with Vandana Shiva - The Role of Patents in the Rise of Globalization / Global Eyes / In Motion Magazine|publisher=Inmotionmagazine.com|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> Shiva calls the patenting of life ‘biopiracy’, and has fought against attempted patents of several indigenous plants.

In 2001, following intensive campaigning, RiceTec lost most of its claims to the patent.  ===Golden Rice=== Shiva strongly opposes [[Golden rice]], a breed of rice that has been genetically engineered to biosynthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of Vitamin A. It was developed for purely humanitarian purposes, has the potential to prevent "half a million to 3 million poor children a year" from becoming [[Blindness|blind]], and would assist in alleviating the [[vitamin A deficiency]] suffered by 250 million people in developing countries.<ref name=why>[http://reason.com/archives/2001/01/01/dr-strangelunch Dr. Strangelunch Or: Why we should learn to stop worrying and love genetically modified food], The Reason, Ronald Bailey, January 2001.</ref> Shiva has claimed that the women of Bengal grow and eat 150 greens which can do the same, which a furious Martina McGloughlin subsequently compared to "Marie Antoinette, [who] suggested the peasants eat cake if they didn't have access to bread".<ref name=why /> It was also pointed out that "nutritionists at UNICEF doubted it was physically possible to get enough vitamin A from the greens Shiva was recommending".<ref name=why /> Doctor Patrick Moore writes that most of these 250 million children don't eat much else than a bowl of rice a day.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/by-opposing-golden-rice-greenpeace-defies-its-own-values-and-harms-children/article14742332/ By opposing Golden Rice, Greenpeace defies its own values – and harms children], [[The Globe and Mail]], 15 October 2013.</ref> Doctor Adrian Dubock says that golden rice is as cheap as other rice and vitamin A deficiency is the greatest reason for blindness and causes 28% of global preschool child mortality.<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/response-zac-goldsmith-golden-rice-gm-food No, Zac Goldsmith, golden rice is not 'evil GM'.

The creation of seed monopolies, the destruction of alternatives, the collection of superprofits in the form of royalties, and the increasing vulnerability of monocultures has created a context for debt, suicides, and agrarian distress. According to data from the Indian government, nearly 75 percent rural debt is due to purchased inputs. Shiva claims that farmers' debt grows as [[GMO]] corporation's profits grow. According to Shiva, it is in this systemic sense that GM seeds are those of suicide.   But the seller offers golden rice royalty-free to local farmers who earn less than US$10,000 per year--virtually all of the target farming community.  However, farmer suicides had begun to grow before the introduction of the GM seeds, and the growth decreased when GM seeds were introduced. [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) analyzed twice academic articles and government data and concluded the decrease and that there was no evidence on "resurgence" of farmer suicides, GM cotton technology has been very effective in India and there have been many other reasons for the suicides.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2014/01/29/vandana-shiva-anti-gmo-celebrity-eco-goddess-or-dangerous-fabulist/3/ Vandana Shiva, Anti-GMO Celebrity: 'Eco Goddess' Or Dangerous Fabulist?], Jon Entine & Cami Ryan, Forbes, 1/29/2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india Bt Cotton and farmer suicides in India: Reviewing the evidence], International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), 2008.

When the U.S. government dispatched grain and soy to help feed the desperate victims, Shiva held a news conference in New Delhi and said that the donation was proof that “the United States has been using the Orissa victims as guinea pigs” for genetically-engineered products, although she made no mention about the fact that those same products are approved and consumed in the United States.
