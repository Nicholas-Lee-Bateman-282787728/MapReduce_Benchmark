    The MetroCard is the payment method for the New York City Subway; New York City Transit buses, including routes operated by Atlantic Express under contract to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), MTA Bus, and Nassau Inter-County Express systems; PATH; the Roosevelt Island Tramway; AirTrain JFK; and Westchester County's Bee-Line Bus System. It is a thin, plastic card on which the customer electronically loads fares. It was introduced to enhance the technology of the transit system and eliminate the burden of carrying and collecting tokens. The MTA discontinued the use of tokens in the subway on May 3, 2003, and on buses on December 31, 2003. The MetroCard is managed by a division of the MTA known as Revenue Control, MetroCard Sales and manufactured by Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc.  During a swipe, the MetroCard is read, re-written to, then check-read to verify correct encoding.Riazi, Atefeh. MetroCard: Automating New York City’s Public Transit System. Proceedings of the First International Conference on Urban Transportation Systems, American Society of Civil Engineers, Miami, Fla. (March 21–25, 1999).  Each MetroCard stored value card is assigned a unique, permanent ten-digit serial number when it is manufactured. The value is stored magnetically on the card itself, while the card's transaction history is held centrally in the Automated Fare Collection (AFC) Database. When a card is purchased and fares are loaded onto it, the MetroCard Vending Machine or station agent's computer stores the amount of the purchase onto the card and updates the database, identifying the card by its serial number. Whenever the card is swiped at a turnstile, the value of the card is read, the new value is written, the customer is let through, and then the central database is updated with the new transaction as soon as possible. Cards are not validated in real time against the database when swiped to pay the fare. The AFC Database is necessary to maintain transaction records to track a card if needed. It has actually been used to acquit criminal suspects by placing them away from the scene of a crime. The database also stores a list of MetroCards that have been invalidated for various reasons (such as lost or stolen student or unlimited monthly cards), and it distributes the list to turnstiles in order to deny access to a revoked card. The older blue MetroCards were not capable of the many kinds of fare options that the gold ones currently offer. The format of the magnetic stripe used by the blue MetroCard offered very little other than the standard pay-per-swipe fare. Also, gold MetroCards allow groups of people (up to four) to ride together using a single pay-per-swipe MetroCard. The gold MetroCard keeps track of the number of swipes at a location in order to allow those same number of people to transfer at a subsequent location, if applicable. The MetroCard system was designed to ensure backward compatibility, which allowed a smooth transition from the blue format to gold. Cubic later used the proprietary MetroCard platform to create the Chicago Card, which is physically identical to the MetroCard except for the labeling. The SingleRide Ticket (introduced to replace subway tokens and single cash fares) is a piece of paper with a magnetic strip on the front, and with the date and time of purchase stamped on the back. SingleRide Tickets are not frequently used, having been used by only 3% of subway riders in 2009.http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/nyregion/27single.html Although the Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard is accepted on PATH, the regular SingleRide ticket is not. However, a PATH SingleRide ticket is available from MVMs in PATH stations for $2.75, valid for 2 hours and only on PATH. Accepted on: However, PATH does not accept reduced fare MetroCard. Accepted at: Students who receive a student MetroCard must live: Accepted at:   Senior citizen MetroCards are received via applicationhttp://web.mta.info/nyct/fare/pdf/seniors.pdf and act as a combination photo ID and MetroCard. This type of card is accepted at everywhere the Pay-Per-Ride or time-based MetroCard is valid at, with two exceptions: it is not valid on the PATH, and it is not valid for ticket purchase on New York City-bound LIRR and Metro-North trains in the morning. Reduced-Fare MetroCards (in any variety) are not accepted at PATH stations. Reduced fare customers who do not have a MetroCard may purchase a full-fare round trip MetroCard from a subway station agent by presenting proof of eligibility. This type of card caused complaints because it took up to three months to replace.http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/fare-level-anxiety-senior-metrocards-chore-article-1.1073326 All fare payments must be made using MetroCard or coins (dollar bills and half-dollar coins are not accepted for fare payment on any buses that accept MetroCard, nor in fare payment stations for Select Bus Service buses). All fares are in US dollars. All fares are in US dollars. There is a $1 purchase fee for all new MetroCard purchases within the subway system or at railroad stations (except for expiring or damaged MetroCards or MetroCards bought as part of a UniTicket).http://web.mta.info/metrocard/mcCombinationValue.htm About the $1 New Card Fee, MTA.info  All transfers with MetroCard are free from bus to subway, local bus to local bus, and subway to local bus. For transfers to express buses from local buses (except for the BxM4C), an additional US$3.50 is deducted from a Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard.http://mta.info/busco/schedules/qm001cur.pdf QM1 schdeule fare information, page 2 With coins, transfers are available to different local buses only, with some restrictions.

The BxM4C does not accept paper or MetroCard transfers, but it does issue transfers to/from other buses and the subway. NICE customers needing to transfer to City of Long Beach N69, Suffolk County Transit, or Huntington Area Rapid Transit  services must ask for a transfer, even if paying with MetroCard. The MetroCard Bus Transfer is issued upon request to passengers who pay cash fares on buses accepting MetroCard. The transfer is inserted into the fare box on the second bus, which retains it. Westchester Bee Line bus system and Nassau Inter-County Express and MTA New York City Transit bus is free to transfer from one bus to another bus that is accepted with MetroCard. The bus transfer is paper like the SingleRide Metrocard. This transfer does not grant cash customers subway access. For suburban transfers, if the fare paid to get the transfer is less than that required on the second bus, the difference must be paid on boarding. For transfers from NICE to New York City Transit, no step up fee is required. The predecessor to the MetroCard bus transfer was the original bus transfer. These paper tickets allowed bus to bus transfers. Available in pads of several different colors for use at different times, boroughs or directions, they would be torn at a certain time-marked line to indicate when the transfer would expire. A version of this still exists today as the "General Order Transfer" (aka "block ticket") which is provided to customers as they leave the subway system during service disruptions to re-enter the system at another point (often via a shuttle bus). There are restrictions on transfers, as noted below: There are no out-of-system subway-to-subway transfers allowed (i.e. exiting the turnstile and entering again; see also Shanghai Metro variant), with the exception of a transfer between Lexington Avenue / 59th Street on the IRT Lexington Avenue and BMT Broadway Lines and Lexington Avenue / 63rd Street on the IND 63rd Street Line.http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ Out-of-system transfer detail, MTA.info Until 2011, an extra out-of-system subway-to-subway transfer was allowed between 23rd Street – Ely Avenue/Long Island City – Court Square on the IND Queens Boulevard and Crosstown Lines and 45th Road – Court House Square on the IRT Flushing Line. This transfer was rendered obsolete when an enclosed in-system transfer passageway was opened between the three stations in 2011. Additional exceptions may be added on a case by case basis, usually due to construction making a regular transfer unavailable. For Pay-per-Ride customers, there is no free transfer back onto the same route on which the fare was initially paid, or between the following buses:http://mta.info/metrocard/termsreg.htm "Regular MetroCard Conditions of Use", MTA.info There are no subway-to-bus or bus-to-subway transfers without a MetroCard allowed, with one exception: All new MetroCard purchases are charged a $1 fee, except reduced fare customers and those exchanging damaged / expired cards. Booths are located in all subway stations and are staffed by station agents. Every type of MetroCard can be purchased at a booth with the exception of the SingleRide ticket (purchased at the MetroCard Vending Machine), and MetroCards specific to other transit systems (PATH, AirTrain JFK). All transactions must be in cash.http://web.mta.info/metrocard/buybooth.htm MetroCard Vending Machines (MVMs) are machines located in all subway stations, the Staten Island Ferry terminals, the Roosevelt Island Tramway stations, the Hempstead Transit Center, Eltingville Transit Center, just inside the Central Terminal at LaGuardia Airport, at the Howard Beach and Jamaica AirTrain terminals near John F. Kennedy International Airport, and the NYC Visitors Center on 7 Avenue & 53 Street. They debuted on January 25, 1999 and are now found in two models. Standard MVMs are large vending machines that accept cash, credit cards, and debit cards and are in every subway station. Cash transactions are required for purchases of less than $1, and they can return up to $8 in coin change. There are also smaller versions of these machines, known as MetroCard Express Machines (MEMs), that only accept credit and ATM/debit cards. Both machines allow a customer to purchase any type of MetroCard through a touch screen. MVMs can also reload previously-issued MetroCards. PATH fare vending machines can also dispense MetroCards. The machines are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 through use of braille and a headset jack. Audible commands for each menu item are provided once a headset is connected and the proper sequence is keyed through the keypad. All non-visual commands are then entered via the keypad instead of the touch screen.   A number of MetroCard sales vans and a MetroCard bus (a retired bus converted for sales duty) routinely travel to specific locations in New York City and Westchester County, stopping for a day (or half a day) at the announced locations. MetroCards can be purchased or refilled directly from these vehicles. Reduced-fare MetroCard applications can also be processed on the bus, including taking photographs for these cards. The MetroCard van serves all five boroughs and Westchester County, while the MetroCard bus serves Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, and parts of Brooklyn. Vendors can apply to sell MTA fare media at their business. Only presealed, prevalued cards are available, and no fee is charged. A comprehensive listing can be found on the MTA website.*http://www.mta.info Metropolitan Transportation Authority Homepage Railroad ticket vending machines (TVM) for the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad offer the option to purchase combined tickets/passes and MetroCards. A $5.00 MetroCard is available with a round-trip ticket, $30 MetroCard with a weekly pass and $40 MetroCard with monthly pass. In addition, the machines sell separate $20 MetroCards. TVMs at Jamaica Station and Penn Station sell AirTrain monthly passes on the back of LIRR tickets. All cards sold from these machines are on thick paper stock, not the normal plastic. Beginning in 2007 with the start of service on the S89 bus, a combined HBLR monthly pass and monthly MetroCard is available at NJT Ticket Vending Machines at HBLR stations. In 2006 the MTA and Port Authority announced plans to replace the magnetic strip with smart cards. On July 1, 2006, MTA launched a six-month pilot program to test the new "contact-less" smart card fare collection system, initially ending on December 31, 2006 but extended until May 31, 2007.The NYC Subway Trial - FAQs (MasterCard) This program was tested at all stations on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and at four stations in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. The testing system utilized Citibank Mastercard's Paypass keytags. This smart card system is intended to ease congestion near the fare control area by reducing time spent paying for fare. MTA and other transportation authorities in the region say they will eventually implement system-wide. Beginning October 7, 2012, MetroCard vending machines scattered throughout Manhattan dispensed something other than the classic blue and gold MetroCard. The MTA has begun to sell advertisement space on the front and back of the card to raise additional revenue. The ad appearing on the cards was purchased by The Gap and reads: "Be Bright NYC" with multicolored letters on a navy blue background. It encourages New Yorkers to visit Gap's newly remodeled flagship store at 34th Street and Broadway starting October 10, 2012. Customers who present the MetroCard at any Gap store were entitled to a 20% discount on merchandise purchases through November 18, 2012. The MTA had been running advertisements on the back of MetroCards since its inception, earning advertiser fees along with expired card value (accruing when purchased fares wind up not being used on a card deemed a collectible by fans). Deals were arranged as early as 1997. However, this is the first time the front of the cards have changed in over 10 years. Approximately 10% of the MetroCards sold throughout the system in a typical month will carry the Gap ad. Future MetroCard advertising campaigns will include the word "MetroCard" on the back of the card, flush right in the white space above the zone available for advertising. Recently, the MetroCards have displayed Grand Central Terminal advertising the 100 year anniversary of the famous clock, encouraging tourists and New Yorkers to visit said clock. The back of the MetroCard states: "Meet Me at the Clock. The clock on top of the Information Booth in the middle of Grand Central Terminal is one of the most recognizable icons in New York City and has been a famous rendezvous spot for 100 years."  The MetroCard system is susceptible to various types of unauthorized resale. At times, this may involve individuals charging to swipe another commuter into the subway system. Usually these frauds involve the person preventing or dissuading the commuter from using his or her own MetroCard, and then charging the commuter for entry to the system (entry is gained by a method that costs the individual nothing). The individual can use an array of unlimited cards, selling rides for a discounted price. Multiple cards are needed because of the 18-minute delay between each swipe at the same station. Using unlimited cards, one is able to sell rides for a discounted price. In addition, MetroCard Vending Machines are programmed to disable the bill or coin acceptor after a series of rejected bills or coins, which can result in a row of MVMs all saying "No Bills" or "No Coins". A report from New York State Senator Martin J. Golden  claims these behaviors cost the MTA $260,000 a year. All aspects of this scam have been recently prohibited by MTA policy and a New York State law. It is now a crime to: The introduction of MetroCards did eliminate one class of unauthorized resale. When the NYC subway still used tokens, token suckers would steal tokens by jamming turnstile coin slots, waiting for other passengers to deposit tokens (only to discover that the turnstile did not work), then returning to suck out the token. Token-sucking ended with the retirement of tokens in 2003. The MetroCard does have a magnetic stripe, but both the track offsets and the encoding differ from standard Magstripe cards. It is a proprietary format developed by the contractor Cubic. Off-the-shelf reader/writers for the standard cards are useless, and even hypothetically could work only with both physical and software modification. Some have had partial success decoding it using audio tape recorder heads, laptop sound cards, and custom Linux software.
