     Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)  is Malaysia's main international airport and one of the major airports of South East Asia. Built at a cost of US$3.5 billion in Sepang district of Selangor, it is located approximately  from Kuala Lumpur city centre and serves the Greater Klang Valley conurbation. KLIA is the largest and busiest airport in Malaysia. In 2014, it handled 48,930,409 passengers and 753,899 tonnes of cargo. It is the world's 20th-busiest airport by total passenger traffic, 13th-busiest airport by international passenger traffic, and 28th-busiest airport by cargo traffic. The airport is operated by Malaysia Airports (MAHB) Sepang Sdn Bhd and is the major hub of Malaysia Airlines, MASkargo, AirAsia, AirAsia X, Malindo Air and Rayani Air.   The ground breaking ceremony for Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) took place on 1 June 1993 when the government decided that the existing Kuala Lumpur airport, then known as Subang International Airport (now Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport) could not handle future demand. It was created as part of the Multimedia Super Corridor, a grand development plan for Malaysia. Upon KLIA's completion, Subang Airport's Terminal 1 building was demolished. Malaysia Airports agreed to redevelop the remaining Terminal 3 to create a specialist airport for turboprop and charter planes surrounded by a residential area and a business park. The IATA airport code KUL was transferred from Subang Airport, which currently handles only turboprop aircraft, general aviation and military aircraft. Subang Airport's IATA code was changed to SZB. The airport's site spans  2, of former agricultural land and is one of the world's largest airport sites. An ambitious three-phase development plan anticipates KLIA to have five runways and two terminals each with two satellite terminals. Phase One involved the construction of the main terminal and one satellite terminal, giving a capacity of 25 million passengers, and two full service runways. The Phase One airport had sixty contact piers, twenty remote parking bays with eighty aircraft parking positions, four maintenance hangars and fire stations. Phase Two, designed to increase capacity to 35 million passengers per year is largely complete. Phase Three is anticipated to increase capacity to 100 million passengers per year. Kuala Lumpur International Airport was officially inaugurated by the 10th Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Ja'afar of Negeri Sembilan, on 27 June 1998 at 20:30 MST, a week ahead of Hong Kong International Airport and in time for the 1998 Commonwealth Games. The first domestic arrival was Malaysia Airlines flight MH1263 from Kuantan (Kuantan Airport) at 07:10 MST. The first international arrival was Malaysia Airlines flight MH188 from Malé International Airport at 07:30 MST. The first domestic departure was Malaysia Airlines flight MH1432 to Langkawi (Langkawi International Airport) at 07:20 MST; the first international departure was Malaysia Airlines flight MH84 to Beijing (Beijing Capital International Airport) at 09:00 MST.   The inauguration of the airport was marked with problems. Aerobridge and bay allocation systems broke down, queues built up throughout the airport and baggage handling broke down. Bags were lost and there were waits of over five hours. Most of these issues were remedied eventually, though baggage handling system was plagued with problems until it was put up for a complete replacement tender in 2007. The airport suffered greatly reduced traffic with the general reduction in economic activity brought about by the East Asian financial crisis, SARS, bird flu epidemic (Avian flu), the global financial crisis and the swine flu pandemic. 1998 saw a reduction of passenger numbers as some airlines, including All Nippon Airways (recommencing on 1 September 2015), British Airways (resumed on 28 May 2015), Lufthansa (later reinstated) and Northwest Airlines, terminated their loss making services to KLIA. KLIA's first full year of operations in 1999, in its Phase One manifestation (capacity of 25 million passengers per year), saw only 13.2 million passengers. Passenger numbers eventually increased to 21.1 million in 2004 and 23.2 million in 2005 — though short of the originally estimated 25 million passengers per year by 2003. Kuala Lumpur International Airport has three parallel runways (one for Terminal 1, one for KLIA Terminal 2, and one runway that can be used for both terminalsFor KLIA2, arrivals for can only use 32L while departures can only use 14R). Two KLIA operational runways are located 2 kilometres from each other, which are designed for simultaneous take-offs and landings. Terminal 1 runways are monitored by the main Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower, which was the tallest ATC tower in the world (currently 3rd, behind Bangkok Suvarnabhumi). Runway 3 for klia2 is monitored by a dedicated separate ATC Tower which, standing at 133.8m, is currently the tallest in the world. KLIA features a number of modern design features that assist in the efficient operation of the airport. It is one of the first Asia Pacific airports to become 100% Bar Coded Boarding Pass capable.

As there are international flights operating out from the airport, therefore terminals of the airport are equipped with immigration processing facilities and security scanning for all passengers including domestic passengers. The Satellite terminal handles most of the international flights, while the main terminal building's contact pier handles domestic traffic, regional international flights and international flights routed to other hubs within Malaysia. Malaysia Airlines operate from both terminals, where main terminal building's contact pier is their preferred terminal for domestic flights.

Each 250-person capacity train can transport 3,000 passengers per hour in each direction at up to 56&nbsp;km/h (35&nbsp;mph). These three-car driverless trains run on elevated rail and under the taxiways. The journey takes under two minutes. The Aerotrain operates between three to five-minute intervals between terminal. Automatic train controls manage the operation of the entire Aerotrain system, controlling the speeds, headways, stops and door openings in stations, and integrating functions that enhance the reliability and performance of the system.<ref name="Kiat.net: Kuala Lumpur International">{{cite web|title=Kuala Lumpur International|url=http://kiat.net/klia/index.html|publisher=Kiat.net|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>  [[KLIA Transit]] and [[KLIA Ekspres]] provides landside connections between klia2 and KLIA Main Terminal Building (MTB), and vice versa.

There are two ERL stations at the airport: [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport ERL station|KLIA station]] at the Main Terminal Building and [[klia2 ERL station|klia2 station]] at Gateway@klia2. The airport is served by two rail services on the ERL: *[[KLIA Ekspres]]: The dedicated [[airport rail link]] which runs non-stop between KL Sentral and KLIA. The journey takes 28 minutes to/from KLIA, and 33 minutes to/from klia2 with a two-minute stop at KLIA. The KLIA Ekspres terminal at KL Sentral is known as the [[KL Sentral#KL City Air Terminal|KL City Air Terminal]] (KL CAT), which has an [[IATA]] designation '''XKL'''. KL CAT offers in-town flight check-in service up to two hours before flight departure time for passengers travelling on [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Etihad Airways]], [[Malaysia Airlines]] and [[Royal Brunei Airlines]]. *[[KLIA Transit]]: A [[commuter rail]] service which stops at three additional stops ([[Bandar Tasik Selatan station|Bandar Tasik Selatan]], [[Putrajaya/Cyberjaya ERL station|Putrajaya/Cyberjaya]] and [[Salak Tinggi ERL station|Salak Tinggi]]) between KL Sentral and KLIA. The journey takes 35 minutes to/from KLIA and 39 minutes to/from klia2. Check-in facilities are not available at KLIA Transit stations.  ===Taxis and limousine=== Airport taxis or airport limousines are provided by Airport Limo. The taxis and limousines are readily available at the Taxi and Limousine counters. They run from airport itself to destinations in Klang Valley and Greater Klang Valley. The fares are to be paid at the counter and are charged according to the destinations' zone. A surcharge is applied for services between 12&nbsp;am to 5&nbsp;am  ===Bus=== Both public and private buses connect KLIA and klia2 to several points in Kuala Lumpur and beyond.  ==Expansion and developments==  ===Plans=== [[File:KLIAAeropolis.jpg|thumb|KLIA Aeropolis Masterplan]]  With the slight modification of the masterplan, the future Terminal 2's satellite terminal will be combined into one satellite terminal. The expansion of Terminal 2's satellite terminal will be exactly the same as Terminal 1's satellite terminal, where initially the satellite terminal will have four arms, and another four arms when the terminal reached its capacity. There is sufficient land and capacity to develop facilities to handle up to 97.5 million passengers a year, four runways by the year 2020 and two mega-terminals, each linked with satellite terminals.<ref name="KLIA Phases"/>  {| class="collapsible wikitable collapsed" style="width: 70% ; font-size: 85%; border: #999 solid 1px; text-align: lcenter; margin-bottom: 0; margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |- ! colspan="5" style="background: #8B8589;"| '''Summary of Kuala Lumpur International Airport Masterplan''' |- style="font-weight:bold; background:#d3d3d3;" !Phase!!Year!!Description |- |rowspan="2"|Phase 1||1998||Initial Capacity of 25 million Passenger Per Annum |- |2006||Capable of Handling 35 million Passengers per annum with the construction of Low Cost Carrier Terminal |- |Phase 2||2008||Expansion of Low Cost Carrier Terminal to accommodate 40 Million Passengers per annum. |- |rowspan="2"|Phase 3||2011||New Low Cost Carrier Terminal will be constructed to accommodate additional 30 million (55 million) passengers Per Annum, Current Low Cost Carrier Terminal converted to cargo usage. |- |Not fixed||Satellite Terminal B will be constructed to handle maximum of 75 million passengers.
