    The Westland WS-61 Sea King is a British licence-built version of the American Sikorsky S-61 helicopter of the same name, built by Westland Helicopters. The aircraft differs considerably from the American version, with Rolls-Royce Gnome engines (derived from the US General Electric T58), British-made anti-submarine warfare systems and a fully computerised flight control system. The Sea King was primarily designed for performing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. A Sea King variant was adapted by Westland as troop transport known as the Commando. In British service, the Westland Sea King provided a wide range of services in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. As well as wartime roles in the Falklands War, the Gulf War, the Balkans conflict, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War, the Sea King is perhaps most well known in its capacity as a Royal Navy Search and Rescue (red and grey livery) and RAF Search and Rescue Force (yellow livery) helicopter. The Sea King was also adapted to meet the Royal Navy's requirement for a ship-based airborne early warning platform. As of 2014, the WS-61 Sea King remains in operation in Britain, as well as several export customers: Germany, Norway, Egypt and India. Some operators have replaced, or are planning to replace, the Sea King with more modern helicopters, such as the NHIndustries NH90 and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin. Westland Helicopters, which had a long-standing licence agreement with Sikorsky Aircraft to allow it to build Sikorsky's helicopters, extended the agreement to cover the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King soon after the Sea King's first flight in 1959.James 1991, pp. 377–378.Uttley 2001, p. 206. Westland proceeded to independently develop the Sea King, integrating a significant proportion of components from British suppliers; key changes include the use of a pair of Rolls-Royce Gnome turboshaft engines and the implementation of an automatic flight control system.McGowen 2005, p. 119. On this matter, authors Jim Thorn and Gerald Frawley stated that: "Despite appearances, Westland's Sea King [is a] very different aircraft from Sikorsky's".Thorn and Frawley 1998, p. 164. Many of the differences between the Westland-built Sea King and the original helicopter were as a result of differing operational doctrine. While the U.S. Navy Sea Kings were intended to be under tactical control of the carrier from which they operated, the Royal Navy intended its helicopters to be much more autonomous, capable of operating alone, or coordinating with other aircraft or surface vessels. This resulted in a different crew arrangement, with operations being controlled by an observer rather than the pilot, as well as fitting a search radar.Lake 1996, pp. 114–115. The Royal Navy selected the Sea King to meet a requirement for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter to replace the Westland Wessex, placing an order with Westland for 60 SH-3D Sea Kings in June 1966.Air International May 1981, p. 215. The prototype and three pre-production aircraft were built by Sikorsky at Stratford, Connecticut and shipped to the United Kingdom to act as trials and pattern aircraft.Howard et al. 2011, pp. 229–230. The first of the SH-3Ds was initially fitted with General Electric T58s and, after being shipped from the United States, was flown in October 1966 from the dockside at Avonmouth to Yeovil airfield. The other three were delivered from the docks, by road to Yeovil, for completion with British systems and Rolls-Royce Gnome engines. The first Westland-built helicopter, designated Sea King HAS1, flew on 7 May 1969 at Yeovil. The first two helicopters were used for trials and evaluation by Westland and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment; subsequent production Sea Kings were delivered to the Royal Navy's 700 Naval Air Squadron from August 1969 onwards. By 1979, the Royal Navy had ordered 56 HAS1s and 21 HAS2s to meet the anti-submarine requirements, these were also configured for the secondary anti-ship role.Hewish 1979, p. 76. The Westland Sea King was updated and adapted for numerous roles, subsequent variants include the HAS2, HAS5 and HAS6. Changes from initial production aircraft included an expansion of the cabin and upgraded engines.McGowen 2005, pp. 119–120. One of the most extensively modified variants was the Westland Commando, operated by the Royal Navy as the HC4.McGowen 2005, p. 120.Air Forces, May 2012, p.6, Key Publishing,   The Commando had capacity for up to 28 fully equipped troops and had originally been developed to meet an Egyptian Air Force requirement.McGowen 2005, pp. 120, 126. Due to the deletion of the amphibious capability, not required in the Egyptian desert, the most noticeable change from the Sea King was the deletion of the side floats, the main undercarriage being carried on stub sponsons. An improved variant of the Egyptian Commando, with changes including the fitting of folding blades common to the ASW variants, was designated as the Sea King HC4 by the Royal Navy and all the aircraft were new build. First flying on 26 September 1979,  due to its operational range of up to 600 nautical miles without refuelling, the HC4 'Commando' became an important asset for amphibious warfare and troop transport duties, in particular."Westland – Sea King/Commando." Flight International, 3 August 1985, p. 42. Several Royal Naval Air Squadrons have operated the Commando variant, such as 845 Naval Air Squadron, 846 Naval Air Squadron and 848 Naval Air Squadron. In British service, the Sea King HC4 was deployed on operations in the Falklands, the Balkans, both Gulf Wars, Sierra Leone, Lebanon and Afghanistan. Towards the end of the Sea King's operational life, several HAS6s were repurposed by the removal of the ASW equipment, as troop transports. In 2010, the last of the UK's converted ASW Sea Kings to troop transports were retired.Allen, Peter. "UK RN retires final Commando Sea King Mk 6CR." Jane's Defence Weekly, Volume 47, Issue 2, 2 June 2010, p. 33. In the 1970s, Westland's experience with the Sea King led the company to conduct the British Experimental Rotor Program (BERP), in coordination with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which applied innovations in composite materials and new design principles to the helicopter rotor. Initial trials carried out with active Sea Kings found several advantages to the BERP rotor, including a longer fatigue life and improved aerodynamic characteristics. Subsequent Westland helicopters, such as the record-breaking Lynx and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, took advantage of BERP rotors for greater performance.Bud and Gummett 2002, pp. 75–79. Westland equipped later-built Sea Kings with the new composite rotors as well."Westland – Sea King." Flight International, 1 August 1987, p. 34. Retrieved 19 April 2012. Westland has produced a total of 330 Sea Kings;McGowen 2005, p. 126. export customers include the Indian Naval Air Arm, the German Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, and the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The last of the Royal Navy's Sea Kings in the ASW role was retired in 2003, being replaced by the AgustaWestland Merlin HM1. The Sea King Airborne Surveillance and Control (ASaC) variant is expected to be replaced around the introduction of the two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.Beedall, Richard. "Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control (MASC) (UK MoD)." Navy Matters, 18 May 2011. Retrieved 19 April 2012. The UK has also planned to retire the HC4 and search and rescue variants in March 2016.  A dedicated search and rescue (SAR) version, the HAR3, was developed for the RAF Search and Rescue Force. The type entered service in 1978 to replace the Westland Whirlwind HAR.10.Ministry of Defence 2006, p. 120. A 16th helicopter was ordered shortly after, and following the Falklands War of 1982, three more examples were purchased to enable operation of a SAR flight in the islands, initially from Navy Point on the north side of Stanley harbour, and later from RAF Mount Pleasant. In 1992, six further helicopters were ordered to replace the last remaining Westland Wessex helicopters in the SAR role, entering service in 1996. The six Sea King HAR3As featured updated systems, including a digital navigation system and more modern avionics.Chesneau 1985, pp. 2–3. Westland also manufactured SAR versions of the Sea King for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the German Navy and the Belgian Air Force.Chesneau 1985, p. 2. On SAR variants, the cabin was enlarged by a stretch of the fuselage behind the door; another key feature, used for additional flotation in the unusual event of a water landing, inflatable buoyancy bags were housed inside the aircraft's sponsons.Chesneau 1985, pp. 2–4. Upgrades and changes made to SAR Sea Kings include the addition of radar warning receivers, a cargo hook for the underslung carriage of goods, and the redesigning of the cockpit for compatibility with night vision goggles.Chesneau 1985, p. 5. , up to 12 HAR3/3As were dispersed across the UK, a further two HAR3s were attached to the Falkland Islands, providing 24-hour rescue coverage. Some Royal Navy HAS5 ASW variants were adapted for the SAR role and served with 771 Naval Air Squadron, Culdrose and HMS Gannet SAR Flight at Prestwick Airport in Scotland. , they are expected to remain in service until 2016, being replaced with civilian operated SAR rotorcraft.Carrara 2009, pp. 78–82. Both Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge have flown SAR Sea Kings in front-line roles.Harding, Thomas. "Harry gets his wish to see action in Iraq." The Telegraph, 23 February 2007. Retrieved 19 April 2012. The Royal Navy's airborne early warning (AEW) capability had been lost when the Fairey Gannet aeroplane was withdrawn after the last of the RN's fleet carriers was decommissioned in 1978. During the Falklands War, a number of warships were lost and casualties suffered due to the lack of an AEW platform.Armistead and Armistead 2002, p. 131. The proposed fleet cover by the RAF Shackleton AEW.2 was too unresponsive and at too great a distance to be practical. Consequently, two Sea King HAS2s were modified in 1982 with the addition of the Thorn-EMI ARI 5980/3 Searchwater LAST radar attached to the fuselage on a swivel arm and protected by an inflatable dome. This allowed the radar to be lowered below the fuselage during flight and for it to be raised for landing. These prototypes, designated HAS2(AEW), were both flying within 11 weeks and deployed with 824 "D" Flight on HMS Illustrious, serving in the Falklands after the cessation of hostilities.Instant Airborne Radar Heads South. "New Scientist", 12 August 1982, 95(1318), p. 428. A further eight HAS2s were modified to a production standard, known as the AEW2. Two remained "fitted for but not with".  These entered operational service in 1985, being deployed by 849 Naval Air Squadron. Three Sea King HAS5/6s were later converted as part of the ASaC Mk7 programme, bringing the Mk7 fleet to 13; still 3 below the requirement. The upgrade programme resulted in the Sea King AEW fleet being upgraded with a new mission system, Comms, NavAids, JTIDS, Active Noise Reduction and Videographic recording.  The Mission System Upgrade (MSU) component (Radar and partial JTIDS integration) was based around the improved Searchwater 2000AEW radar, with an all-new man Machine Interface.  This MSU compoent was later termed "Project Cerberus" by Thales, after successful integration was conducted by Westland and GEC-Marconi.   This variant was initially referred to as the Sea King AEW7, but renamed ASaC7 just before In Service Date.  (Airborne Surveillance and Control Mk.7). The main role of the Sea King ASaC7 is detection of low-flying attack aircraft; it also provides interception/attack control and over-the-horizon targeting for surface-launched weapon systems. In comparison to older versions, the new radar enables the ASaC7 to simultaneously track up to 400 targets, instead of an earlier limit of 250 targets."Cerberus set for service aboard Sea King Whiskey, Upgrade Update." Jane's International Defence Review, 24 September 2002. Retrieved 19 April 2012. The effectiveness of the AEW7 was greatly increased via the addition of a Link 16 data link, allowing gathered radar information to be analysed and rapidly put to use by multiple allied platforms in range.Armistead and Armistead 2002, pp. 132–134. The ASaC7s will remain in service until they are replaced under the "Crowsnest" programme; intended as a podded capability onboard Merlins.  Previous proposed replacement programmes, Future Organic Airborne Early Warning (FOAEW) and MASC (Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control) were initiated and then cancelled, due largely to the erroneous assumption that the entire ASaC Mk7 system could simply be lifted and plugged into another aircraft type.  However, as a result of the time gap between the planned out of service date of the Sea King in 2016, and the introduction of  "Crowsnest" seven Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters will remain in service with the RN through to the second half of 2018.http://www.janes.com/article/37615/uk-extends-sea-king-asac-7-life-out-to-2018  A number of Sea Kings were deployed during the Falklands War. They were transported to the combat zone and operated from the decks of various ships of the Royal Navy, such as the landing platform dock .Chant 2001, pp. 15–16. In the theatre, they performed a wide range of missions, from anti-submarine patrols and reconnaissance flights to replenishment operations and the insertion of special forces.Freedman 2005, pp. 298, 728. Support provided by the Sea Kings in the form of transport for men and supplies has been viewed as vital to the success of the British operation.McGowen 2005, p. 15. Sea Kings also protected the fleet by acting as decoys against incoming Exocet missiles, with some missions being flown by Prince Andrew, Duke of York."Prince Andrew Tells of Being Decoy for Exocet." Glasgow Herald, 19 June 1982, p. 1. Anti-Submarine Sea Kings of 820 Naval Air Squadron was embarked on . With 11 HAS.5s, the squadron operated anti-submarine and search and rescue sorties with one helicopter always airborne on surface search duties.Burden et al. 1986, pp. 237–240. On 14 June, an 820 NAS Sea King HAS.5 was used to transport Major General Jeremy Moore to Port Stanley to accept the surrender of Argentine troops on the island. The squadron flew 1,650 sorties during the war. A Flight of 824 Naval Air Squadron embarked two Sea King HAS.2As aboard  and were used to move supplies to other ships on the way south and later anti-submarine patrols.Burden et al. 1986, pp. 241–243. C Flight had three Sea King HAS.2As on board  which were used for replenishment duties, supplying over 2,000 tons of stores. 825 Naval Air Squadron was formed for the war with 10 Sea King HAS.2s modified as utility variants to support ground forces.Burden et al. 1986, pp. 244–247. The anti-submarine equipment was removed and the helicopters fitted with troop seats. Two aircraft embarked on Queen Elizabeth 2 and were later used for moving troops from QE2 to other ships, the remainder embarked on Atlantic Causeway and were used for troop movements around the islands. Embarked on  was 826 Naval Air Squadron with nine HAS.5s, which carried out continuous anti-submarine sorties.Burden et al. 1986, pp. 247–250. From the departure of Hermes from Ascension in April until the Argentine surrender, the squadron operated at least three helicopters airborne continuously for fleet protection. On 23 April 1982, a Sea King HC4 was ditched while performing a risky transfer of supplies to a ship at night, operating from the flagship HMS Hermes.Chant 2001, p. 34. On 12 May, a Sea King operating from Hermes crashed into the sea due to an altimeter problem; all crew were rescued.Burden et al. 1986, pp. 248–249.

During the 1991 Gulf War Sea Kings from several nations, including Canada, Britain, and the U.S., were present in the coalition forces against Saddam Hussain's Iraq regime.Donald and Chant 2001, pp. 15, 41, 54. Due to the threat of potential use of any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, it was standard practice for Sea King crews to wear fully enclosed NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) protective suits.Donald and Chant 2001, p. 15. Britain's Sea Kings primarily engaged in inter-ship transport duties, including ferrying troops between the fleet and land.Donald and Chant 2001, p. 33.

There was thorough radar coverage by U.S. airborne early warning and control  (AWACS) aircraft; British AEW Sea Kings were not deployed.Armistead and Armistead 2002, pp. 179–180. Following the end of hostilities, the available Sea Kings remained on deployment in the region to conduct transport missions to relocate people displaced by the conflict to refugee camps and repatriate citizens to their home countries."Kurdish Refugees Stream Back to Iraq." The Associated Press, 2 May 1991. The Sea King participated in the UN's intervention in Bosnia. 845 Naval Air Squadron and their Sea Kings had been dispatched to the region in late 1992 in response to escalating tensions in the region.Ripley 2001, p. 92. They performed various logistical and transport missions, such as the repositioning of  Royal Artillery L118 Light Guns in the region and in the evacuation of casualties. In one incident on 24 March 1993, during an attempt to establish an air evacuation route to a UN-declared safe zone, a flight of French Aérospatiale Pumas and Sea King HC4 helicopters were shelled while taking off from an improvised landing zone. Two further Sea Kings arrived to evacuate several UN casualties, managing to fly the wounded to the Bosnian city of Tuzla, where they came under further enemy fire while unloading.Ripley 2001, pp. 16–17. During NATO's intervention in Kosovo, Sea Kings of 814 Naval Air Squadron, operating from numerous Royal Navy vessels in the Adriatic, including the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible, maintained a patrol of the Balkans' coast.Hall, Macer.

In 1974, Australia purchased 12 Westland Sea King Mk 50s as the Royal Australian Navy's new ASW helicopter; the Sea Kings replaced the aircraft carrier 's complement of Westland Wessex HAS31 in the following year.Hewish 1984, p. 231. Early operations were troubled by a series of accidents. Between October 1975 to May 1979, four aircraft were lost in accidents, the primary causes were the loss of oil from the main gearbox.Gillett 1986, p. 70.Matherell, Mark and Cynthia Banham. "Bumpy ride, but Sea King pulls its weight." The Sydney Morning Herald, 4 April 2005. Retrieved 19 April 2012. The Australian Sea Kings had similar avionics to that of the Sea King HAS.1, with the same ARI 5995 search radar in a dorsal radome, but had American Bendix AN/ASQ-13A dipping sonar instead of the Plessey sonar of the Royal Navy Sea Kings. They also had more powerful engines giving improved high temperature hover performance. Australia's Sea Kings were flown by 817 Squadron RAN from HMAS Melbourne until the carrier was retired from service, without replacement. As the Sea King was too large to operate from the s, 817 Squadron was then forced to operate from land bases, in both ASW and utility roles, with the Sea King relinquishing the anti-submarine mission in 1990.Lake 1996, pp. 132–133.

The replacement for the Sea King is the MRH 90.   Following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Pakistan invested heavily in modern submarines and long-range torpedoes. In response, India opted to procure six Westland Sea Kings from Britain in 1969, for ASW duties, designated as Mk42. The purchase also included the provision of air-droppable homing torpedoes for use against submarines. The delivery of the aircraft began a few months before the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.Hiranandani 2005, p. 21. Due to training shortfalls on the new helicopters, Sea King operations were considerably restricted during the 1971 war; by November 1971, increased aircrew experience had enabled offensive anti-submarine operations to be conducted.Hiranandani 2005, pp. 87–88. The Majestic class aircraft carrier  was also refitted in 1972–1974 to enable extensive Sea King operations, becoming the carrier's primary anti-submarine aircraft.Hiranandani 2005, pp. 88–89. During the early 1960s, India and Britain agreed upon the domestic production of the . The initial helicopter deployed aboard India's Leanders, known as the , was the Aérospatiale Alouette III, however, this offered much less capability in the anti-submarine role compared with the Sea King and the need for design changes was realised to allow the Sea King to be deployed upon the flight deck of the Nilgiri-class, a practice pioneered by the Royal Canadian Navy using their Sikorsky CH-124 Sea Kings on similar-sized frigates.Hiranandani 2005, pp. 57–58.Singh Air International January 1991, p. 37. It proved unfeasible to operate the Sea King from the unmodified Nilgiri-class, with the last two ships of the class being fitted with an enlarged flight deck and hangar. This required removal of the ship's Limbo anti-submarine mortar.Hiranandani 2005, pp. 58–59, 62.Baker 1998, p. 325. Beyond the original 1971 procurement, India chose to acquire a further six Mk42s in 1974, and three more in 1980; these three had been specifically modified to operate from the flight deck of the last two Nilgiris and designated as Mk42A.Hiranandani 2005, p. 96. As a follow-on to the Nilgiris, India commenced development of a new frigate, based on the Leander/Nilgiri, but larger. The resultant , also known as Project 16, could operate two Sea Kings simultaneously.Hiranandani 2005, p. 64. In 1982, India signed a contract to purchase several Mk42B Sea Kings, an upgraded variant to perform dual-purpose: anti-shipping and anti-submarine missions, following a competition for the order against the Aérospatiale Super Puma.Hiranandani 2005, pp. 97–98. These helicopters would operate from the Godavari-class frigates as well as replace the existing Sea Kings. A team of Indian engineers was sent to Britain to help develop the Mk42B's avionics, especially the onboard software. Changes from the older Sea Kings included a brand new avionics suite, the use of composite materials throughout the fuselage and in the rotor blades, as well as the integration of the Sea Eagle missile, which had been procured from Britain in 1983.Byers 1986, p. 232. Between 1988 and 1992, a total of 20 Mk42B Sea Kings were delivered to the Indian Navy.Hiranandani 2012, p. 157. Six Sea Kings in troop-carrying capacity, designated Mk42C, were also procured in 1987.Hiranandani 2005, p. 99. Although the Indian Navy considered the AEW Sea King, expected to be designated as Mk42D, it was judged to be too expensive, consequently, in 2003, the Russian Kamov Ka-31 was procured instead.Hiranandani 2005, p. 107. The indigenous HAL Dhruv was the intended replacement for the Sea King in the ASW role, however, in 2000, it was deemed unsuited, as the Indian Navy were dissatisfied with the design's folding blade mechanism and by the Dhruv's maintenance record.Govindasamy, Siv.

In May 1998, the United States enacted sanctions upon India as a part of the international response to a series of nuclear weapons tests by India. , these sanctions effectively grounded India's Sea Kings because India could not purchase any US-supplied spare parts for the fleet. Westland also complied with the sanctions by refusing to maintain any US-made components.Bilgrami 2004, pp. 186–187. A limited number of Sea Kings were kept operational by cannibalising other aircraft and the manufacture of some components by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). In December 2000, President Bill Clinton permitted a relaxation of the sanctions.Bilgrami 2004, pp. 187, 199. In the late 2000s, HAL and AgustaWestland signed an agreement to jointly maintain and perform upgrades to India's fleet of Sea Kings.Hiranandani 2012, p. 158.  The Norwegian Ministry of Justice owns 12 Mk43B Sea Kings which are operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Forces's 330 Squadron. The aircraft are used for SAR and air ambulance missions and are under the command of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway and Northern Norway. Introduced in May 1973, they were originally stationed at Bodø Main Air Station, Ørland Main Air Station, Sola Air Station and Station Group Banak. In 1997, the squadron conducted 237 SAR and 747 air ambulance missions. From 1995 to 1998, one helicopter was stationed at Ålesund Airport, Vigra, and since 1999, one has been stationed at Rygge Air Station. Florø Airport became a station for one helicopter from 2009. The helicopters are to be replaced by AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin under the Norwegian All-Weather Search and Rescue Helicopter (NAWSARH) programme. The candidates for the NAWSARH contract of 10–12 helicopters was the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, NHIndustries NH-90, Eurocopter EC225 and Sikorsky S-92."Candidates that passed the Pre-qualification process for delivery of future SAR helicopters for Iceland and Norway." Royal Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police. Retrieved: 26 February 2012. July 2013, AgustaWestland (AW101 Merlin) and Eurocopter (EC225) was short-listed to conduct further discussions for the NAWSARH programme for up to 16 helicopters. The German Navy placed an order for 22 Sea King Mk.41s on 20 June 1969 as a replacement for the Grumman Albatross flying boat in the Search and Rescue Role. This was the first export sale for the Westland Sea King, and was the first dedicated Search and Rescue Sea King variant, with an enlarged cabin and more fuel. The German Sea Kings had similar radar and navigation equipment to the HAS.1, but was not fitted with sonar.James 1991, p. 389. The 22 Sea Kings were delivered between April 1973 and September 1974, equipping Marinefliegergeschwader 5 (MFG 5) (Naval Air Wing 5). An additional Sea King was delivered in April 1975 to replace one destroyed in a gale. The surviving Sea Kings were upgraded between 1986 and 1988, adding the capability to carry Sea Skua anti-ship missiles, which required the addition of a Ferranti Seaspray radar in a nose radome. The 21 remaining Sea Kings are tasked to a variety of roles including SAR, transport, disaster relief, tactical land–sea transport, evacuation, surveillance, reconnaissance and naval support. The main base is Nordholz, although units are always stationed at Heligoland Airport and Warnemünde, and sometimes at Borkum Airfield. The helicopters are scheduled to be replaced by the NH-90.  Egypt is a prolific operator of the Sea King, using many different variants for a wide variety of purposes. In addition to operating ASW Sea Kings for coastal patrols, Egypt procured a land-based transport adapted from the basic Sea King, marketed by Westland as the Commando, including a VIP subvariant.Lake 1996, pp. 133–134.James 1991, p. 392. An electronic warfare version was also deployed by the Egyptian Air Force, featuring sophisticated onboard jamming systems.Lake 1996, p. 135. As of 2011, 23 Sea Kings/Commandos remain in service with Egypt.Hoyle Flight International 13–19 December 2011, p. 38. The Qatar Emiri Air Force also operates Westland's Commando variant, as a standard utility transport for ground forces, a single one was also equipped specially to perform VIP transport duties.Lake 1996, p. 134. A few Qatari Sea Kings serve in an anti-shipping capacity and have been outfitted to carry, and deploy if required, two Exocet anti-ship missiles. Pakistan's Navy took delivery of six Mk.45 Sea Kings, a variant based on the Royal Navy's Sea King HAS.1 from 1975. It served in an combined anti-submarine and anti-ship role, carrying the Exocet missile as an alternative to the normal anti-submarine weapon load of four Mark 44 or Mark 46 torpedos. One of Pakistan's Sea Kings was lost in an accident in February 1986, and was replaced by an ex-Royal Navy HAS.5, redesignated Mk.45C, in January 1989.Fricker Air International June 1991, p. 298.
