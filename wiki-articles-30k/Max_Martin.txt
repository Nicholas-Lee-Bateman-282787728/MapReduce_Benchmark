     Martin Karl Sandberg (born February 26, 1971), known professionally as Max Martin, is a Swedish music producer and songwriter. He rose to prominence in the mid-1990s after making a string of major hits for artists such as the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. Some of his earlier hits include "I Want It That Way" (1999), "...Baby One More Time" (1999) and "It's My Life" (2000). His trademark during the second half of the 1990s and the early 2000s was a danceable, keyboard-laden pop sound that blended music styles such as funk and Europop. However, with Kelly Clarkson's songs "Since U Been Gone" (2004) and "Behind These Hazel Eyes" (2005), Martin stepped back into the spotlight after reinventing himself with a heavier, rock-tinged sound. Since 1999, Martin has written and co-written 21 Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits (most of which he has also produced or co-produced) in the United States, including Katy Perry's "I Kissed a Girl" (2008), Pink's "So What" (2008), Britney Spears's "Hold It Against Me" (2011), Maroon 5's "One More Night" (2012), Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off" (2014). Martin is the songwriter with the third-most number one singles on the chart, behind only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26). In 2015, Martin won the ASCAP Songwriter of the Year award for the fifth consecutive year and for the eighth time in his career tying him with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis as the top recipient of the award. As of February 2015 Martin has had a total of 54 songs reach the top ten charts placing him above Madonna's 38, Elvis Presley's 36 and the Beatles' 34. In 2014 Martin broke ahead of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Dr. Luke to take the second-place position on the list of most number one hits for a producer behind only George Martin who has 23. In early 2013 his single sales were tallied by The Hollywood Reporter to be at over 135 million. Martin Sandberg grew up in Stenhamra, Ekerö Municipality, a suburb of Stockholm. As a child, Martin was a student of Sweden's much-lauded public music-education program, and once said he had "public music education to thank for everything." Other alumni of the program include Andreas Carlsson, Rami Yacoub, and Anders Bagge, each of whom boasts a discography nearly as long and successful as Martin's. As a teenager he sang in a variety of bands before joining a glam-style metal band called It's Alive in 1985 as their singer and frontman. It's Alive were formed by ex-LAZY members Per Aldeheim and Kim Björkgren on guitars, and John Rosth who had been a member of Lineout. Martin eventually dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music with his band under the nickname "Martin White". In 1988 they participated in the national rock championships and played as the in-house band at a disco in Cyprus. The band got a breakthrough in 1991, as Dave Constable of Megarock Records offered them to make a demo-record. The later debut album was originally pressed in 1,000 copies and later on given away as a free cover tape in the UK by the Metal Forces magazine. The decision to focus on a music career paid off as they landed a record deal on producer Denniz PoP's label Cheiron Records, a BMG affiliate. After recording their second album Earthquake Visions, they released three singles in conjunction with the record and toured through Europe in 1994 supporting Kingdom Come. Earthquake Visions eventually sold a disappointing 30,000 copies, despite being released in as many as 30 countries. More importantly though, Martin also began collaborating on songs with PoP. Recognizing a talent for writing pop songs in the young rocker, PoP renamed his new protégé Max Martin and eventually became Martin’s mentor. "I didn't even know what a producer did, I spent two years&ndash;day and night&ndash;in that studio trying to learn what the hell was going on." &ndash; Max Martin, 19 March 2001.TIME - "Top of the Pops" by Jeff Chu, 19 March. 2001 vol. 157 no. 11 In 1993, Martin was hired by Cheiron Studios and spent some time learning the basics, before the first production collaboration between PoP and Martin: the Rednex song "Wish You Were Here" in 1994. They both worked on Ace of Base's second album The Bridge (1995) shortly thereafter, as well as on albums by 3T, Army of Lovers and Leila K. To date, The Bridge has sold more than six million copies worldwide, including one million in the United States. When Martin eventually left his band It's Alive in late 1995, he was replaced by Anders Jansson. In 1995, the Cheiron Studios was hired by Zomba to work on Backstreet Boys' self-titled debut album Backstreet Boys (1996). Zomba became the main working partner since the success in 1995. Martin took part in the production of "Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)" (1996), co-written with Herbie Crichlow, a single which quickly went platinum and climbed to No.&nbsp;2 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as the singles "As Long As You Love Me" (1997) and "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)" (1997). The album was not released in the U.S. until 1997, but was released overseas and caught on all across Europe, eventually selling around 8 million copies worldwide. This led to the Backstreet Boys being relaunched in their home country later on, this time more successfully. Later that year, Martin co-wrote and co-produced Robyn's hits "Show Me Love" and  "Do You Know (What It Takes)" which ended up on the Billboard Hot 100 top 10. In 1998, Cheiron Productions worked on albums by Five and Jessica Folcker. Jessica Folcker had first been hired as a backing singer for tracks with Ace of Base and Dr. Alban, and her debut album Jessica became an instant hit with singles like "Tell Me What You Like" and "How Will I Know Who You Are" which both sold platinum. After Denniz PoP died of cancer that same summer, Martin took over as director of Cheiron Studios. He soon started working with writer/producer Rami Yacoub, who continued to be his partner for many years. Martin also wrote two songs with Bryan Adams during this time, "Cloud Number Nine" and "Before The Night Is Over". Martin wrote, co-wrote, and co-produced 7 out of the 12 songs on the Backstreet Boys' third album Millennium (1999), including all the singles. "I Want It That Way", a hit song Martin co-wrote with Andreas Carlsson and co-produced with Kristian Lundin, became the group's biggest single to date and it is still popular today. ("I Want It That Way" was voted No. 10 in the MTV/Rolling Stone list of the "100 Greatest Pop Songs.") A VH1 special, 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s, ranked the song at number 1, making it the highest ranked boy-band single and pop song. Millennium sold over 1.1 million units in its first week in the United States, setting a record for most albums sold in its debut week (that record was later beaten by NSYNC's 2000 album No Strings Attached), and was the best-selling album in the world. When working on her own solo album, to be released in 2001 on Stockholm Records, Lisa Miskovsky wrote the lyrics forthe Backstreet Boys' new hit single "Shape of My Heart" with Max Martin and Rami. The song, originally written for Miskovsky’s own album, was passed along to the Backstreet Boys by Max Martin when Miskovsky determined it did not fit her style. The song became the first single off the group's third album Black & Blue (2000). In the first week of release, "Shape of My Heart" immediately jumped into the Top Five in Sweden, Norway, Canada, Germany and another 15 countries. Black & Blue, containing several songs produced and written by Martin, sold 1.6 million units in its first week in America. Martin again received ASCAP's award "Songwriter of the Year" both in 2000 and 2001. In 2013 April, the Backstreet Boys member Brian Littrell call Martin for their single "In A World Like This", the single peak No.6 in the Oricon chart and performed well in the rest of the world. Martin collaborated on the Never Gone songs "Climbing the Walls", "Just Want You to Know", "Siberia", and the melancholy love song "I Still...", a trademark song for the Backstreet Boys. Martin wanted the album to be more of a contemporary, alternative pop album with a little R&B. The resulting album had a more organic music style with more live instruments, and was a departure from The Backstreet Boys' earlier work. Martin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub wrote Westlife's song "I Need You" for the first Westlife album Westlife (1999). Martin, Nick Jarl, Steve Mac, and Patric Jonsson wrote Westlife's song "You Make Me Feel" for their second album Coast to Coast (2000). Also Max Martin, Rami Yacoub, and Andreas Carlsson wrote one of Westlife's hits "When You're Looking Like That" for their second album Coast to Coast (2000). In 1998, Martin wrote and co-produced Spears' hit "...Baby One More Time" for her debut album with the same name, (the hit single was originally offered to both the Backstreet Boys, who turned it down, and TLC, who passed because they were 'taking time off'). The single remains Spears' best-selling single to this date, and on VH1's "100 Greatest Songs of the '90s", it was ranked at number 7. That same year, Martin also co-wrote and co-produced the third single "(You Drive Me) Crazy". In 1999, the album ...Baby One More Time has sold over 15 million copies in the U.S., certifying Diamond Status. Also, within a year of its release, ...Baby One More Time had become the best-selling LP by a teenager in history, selling over 30 million copies. Martin was the first non-American citizen ever to win ASCAP's prestigious award "Songwriter of the Year" in 1999 (an award he also won in 2000 and 2001). Martin worked on Spears' first three studio albums (1999's ...Baby One More Time, 2000's Oops!... I Did It Again, and 2001's Britney), which were made in the style of teen-oriented pop. In this period he co-wrote and co-produced the singles "Oops!... I Did It Again" (2000), "Lucky" (2000), "Stronger", (2000) "Overprotected" (2001), and "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" (2002). However, when Spears recorded her fourth studio album In the Zone (2003), she decided to move away from that genre. The duo ended up parting ways, and Martin had no input on that album nor on her fifth studio album, Blackout (2007). At the request of Spears, Martin produced and wrote for Spears' sixth studio album Circus (2008). Martin co-wrote and produced the provocatively titled, "If U Seek Amy", which was chosen by fans to be the third single of the album. Different from Martin's previous tracks for Spears, "If U Seek Amy" is an electro-pop dance song, in which even the lyrics shows a different, more dance-oriented direction from Spears and Martin's previous work. In July 2009, Spears stated on her Twitter account, that she was in the recording studio in Stockholm, Sweden with Martin.A Tweet from Britney - BRITNEY SPEARS Later, on 29 September 2009, it was announced that Martin had worked with Spears on her upcoming compilation album. Martin produced "3", the song debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Martin was the executive producer (along with Dr. Luke) of Spears' seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011). During a 2011 interview with Rolling Stone, Spears stated that Martin "gets exactly what I am saying when I tell him what I want and don't want musically. His melodies are incredible and he is always coming up with weird sounds, which I love." Adding; "There is nobody I feel more comfortable collaborating with in the studio." In January 2011, "Hold It Against Me" was released as the lead single of Spears' new album; the song later debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Spears' second single to debut at No. 1 and her fourth overall. Martin also co-produced the album's second single "Till the World Ends", peaking at No. 3. As well as co-producing "Hold It Against Me" and "Till the World Ends", Martin co-produced the songs "Inside Out", "I Wanna Go", "Seal It with a Kiss", "Criminal" and "Up n' Down". In May 2011, it was announced "I Wanna Go" would serve as the third single from Femme Fatale. On 5 August 2011, Spears launched a poll on her Facebook page asking fans whether her next single should be "Criminal", "Inside Out" or "(Drop Dead) Beautiful." After the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, she revealed to MTV News that "Criminal" was chosen as the fourth single, marking the first time Martin has produced four singles of a Spears album, beating out himself when he had produced the first three singles from Oops!... I Did It Again. Martin did not contribute to Spears's eighth studio album, Britney Jean. In late 1999 Céline Dion released "That's the Way It Is," a song co-written by Max Martin to promote her greatest hits album All the Way... A Decade of Song. The song became a hit, going to number 1 on the adult contemporary charts in the United States and Canada, and reaching top 10 all over the world. Since the song was released in November 1999, it has cycled 500,000 times on almost 1400 radio stations across Canada and the U.S. In 2003 Martin co-wrote and produced three songs for Céline Dion's album One Heart. One of them called "Faith" was released in 2003 as a promotional single in Canada and reached number 4 on the Quebec Airplay Chart and number 37 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart. The traditional division of work in the record industry typically has the artist writing the songs and then hiring a producer to help shape the sound. At Cheiron it was the other way around; the producers wrote the songs, played the instruments, engineered and mixed the recordings and the artist was only brought in near the end of the process to do the vocals. For example, on Britney Spears's second album Oops!… I Did It Again (2000), Cheiron had already written seven songs and had proceeded to record the layers of music before Britney even arrived at the studios in early November 1999. It took her only one week to do the vocals. Martin and his team worked more like a band that alternated singers. Martin explained his working method:  Despite the success, Cheiron Studios was closed down in 2000. The reason behind the decision to close it down was, according to the press release on their homepage, that the heart and soul of the studio had been lost with the death of Denniz PoP. Another reason for closing the studio down was for the people at Cheiron Studios to be able to do more experimental music work without the weight of the now famous name Cheiron upon their shoulders. Max Martin and Tom Talomaa started a new production company together named Maratone in January 2001 and moved into the famous Cosmos Studios that had housed the production team Kai Erixon and Kent (Gillström) Isaacs whom had been very successful at the Swedish pop/hiphop-arena with numerous gold/platinum-selling artists. Also, David Kreuger and Per Magnusson started A Side Productions and Kristian Lundin started the production company The Location and the publishing company Location Songs together with Jake Schulze and Andreas Carlsson (both also members of Cheiron's production team) at the same location as Cheiron Studios. The first songs to be written and produced at Maratone were four tracks for Britney Spears' third album Britney (2001). The Maratone production crew initially consisted of producers/songwriters Max Martin, Rami, Alexandra, Arnthor and young sensation Shellback, but Rami, Alexandra and Arnthor have all moved on since then. Following the work with Celine Dion on the album One Heart in 2003, few new hits appeared from Maratone until 2005. More recently 2009 has seen a string of hits from the studio including the hits "My Life Would Suck Without You" from Kelly Clarkson and "3" from Britney Spears. In 2004, former American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson traveled to Sweden to collaborate with Max Martin and Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald on songs for her second studio album Breakaway. They decided to create songs that were rockier than anticipated by the fans, as can be heard on the hit singles "Since U Been Gone" (2004) and "Behind These Hazel Eyes" (2005). "Since U Been Gone" became a huge hit and remains one of the biggest hits of Clarkson's career, and one of the biggest hits of 2005. The next single, "Behind These Hazel Eyes", reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 while the single "Since U Been Gone" was still on the chart. In 2009 he also co-wrote Clarkson's single "My Life Would Suck Without You", which has the record for the highest Billboard Hot 100 jump to No. 1, jumping from No. 97 in its first week on the chart. In 2005 Max Martin collaborated with the Norwegian singer Marion Raven for the release of her debut album entitled Here I Am on what may be his first mainstream Rock work, writing the song "Break You" and co-writing with Raven many songs, including "End of Me," "Here I Am," "Little By Little," "In Spite of Me," and "Six Feet Under." "End of Me" and "Break You" were big hits in Asia and Norway. In 2007 "Break You" was included again in Raven's North American and European debut album called Set Me Free. The American singer Megan McCauley also recorded "Break You" in 2006 but the song wasn't included on any of McCauley's albums. In 2005, Max Martin wrote the first single-song for pop punk duo The Veronicas, "4ever", with Lukasz Gottwald for their debut studio album The Secret Life Of... (2005). Also he wrote "Everything I'm Not", the second single-song of The Veronicas, the same year, again with Lukasz Gottwald, Rami, Jessica Origliasso and Lisa Origliasso for the same album The Secret Life Of.... Martin also co-wrote and produced songs on Pink's very successful and critically acclaimed platinum selling fourth album I'm Not Dead. Worldwide the album was the sixth biggest selling album of 2006, going top 5 in the UK, platinum and top ten in the United States, and number one in Australia and Germany. In Australia the album had 5 top five singles, and spent a record 63 weeks in the top 10. As of July 2009 it is 10 times Platinum and has been charting in the top 50 for 146 weeks. Martin also collaborated with Pink for her fifth studio album, Funhouse (2008). Martin co-wrote the first smash hit single, "So What" (2008), plus the tracks "Who Knew" (2006), "Please Don't Leave Me" (2009), "I Don't Believe You" (2009), and "It's All Your Fault". For her Greatest Hits album released 2009 he co-wrote the hits "Raise Your Glass" and "Fuckin Perfect". Martin worked with Avril Lavigne on two songs, "Alone" and "I Will Be", which were released on some deluxe editions of Lavigne's third studio album The Best Damn Thing (2007). Martin also worked on four songs for Lavigne's fourth studio album Goodbye Lullaby (2011): the three singles "What the Hell" (2011), "Smile" (2011), and "Wish You Were Here" (2011), and the album track "I Love You". Max Martin first worked with Jessie J on her international hit "Domino" after Dr Luke and Claude Kelly sought to create a song that showcased her vocals whilst also capable of being a commercial success. Alongside the aforementioned trio and Cirkut, Max Martin co-wrote the track and the song lived up to its hoped-for success becoming her major breakthrough into the US market, charting at number 6, whilst also topping the charts in the United Kingdom for two weeks. It charted in the top 50 most bought tracks in the US for 2012 and was the 8th best selling song in the same year within the United Kingdom with a sales figure of 749,000 in that year alone.http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-selling-singles-of-2012-revealed-1784/ It also achieved top ten success in other countries such as Canada and Australia. Following on from the success of "Domino", Jessie J has also worked with Max Martin for her third studio album on "Bang Bang" (2014) featuring Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj. The song served as the lead single and has achieved vast commercial success such as having the second highest sales figure for a song to debut on the Billboard Hot 100, only surpassed by Ariana Grande's "Problem" (2014). The song has peaked at number 3 on the Hot 100 chart and a music video was released, trumping her previous hit '"Domino". Max Martin is also responsible for some of the songs of Katy Perry on three albums.

Confirmed by RCA Executives on 18 December 2011, Martin worked on Christina Aguilera's seventh studio album Lotus (2012) and was the producer of her lead single, "Your Body" (2012), as well as another song titled "Let There Be Love". Both songs reached the top of the Billboard dance/club chart. Martin produced and co-wrote the Billboard Hot 100 number 1 hit "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" (2012), on Taylor Swift's fourth album Red (2012), which became her first number-one single in the US. Upon its release, the song reached the top position on the iTunes singles chart in 50 minutes, hence breaking the previous record held by Lady Gaga's song "Born This Way" with a record of an hour, making "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" the fastest selling single in digital history at that time.   Swift's "We Are Never Getting Back Together" set the record for the biggest digital sales week (623,000) ever for a song by a female artist, surpassing the record held by Kesha's "Tik Tok" (2009). It also reached the top of the iTunes single chart in 32 countries.

Martin's influence in the music field is also seen in the effect he has had on co-producers. The music site Stereogum singles out three people as his "disciples", Savan Kotecha, Dr. Luke, and Shellback. Time Magazine reported that "There’s a cluster of high-powered songwriters who are based in Sweden, and the grandmaster is Max Martin" and that when Kotecha worked with One Direction he credited Martin's influence 'We work melody first. That’s Max Martin’s school. We’ll spend days, sometimes weeks, challenging the melody. The goal is to make it sound like anyone can do this, but it’s actually very difficult. In Sweden, you don’t do anything until you do it right.'" The New Yorker reported that Martin was Dr. Luke's "Swedish mentor and frequent collaborator. If Luke is the Skywalker of pop songcraft, Max is the Obi-Wan: the reclusive master. ...The vital spark in the musical emergence of Dr. Luke was meeting Max Martin." Dr. Luke himself says of the chemistry between him and Martin "'It happened really fast. It was magical. …[Martin taught me that] Instead of making tracks for five thousand people, why not make tracks for a million?'" The magazine for Swedish music management STIM reported that Shellback became an "apprentice" with Martin acting as "his mentor" at Maratone Studios after 2006 when "Max Martin saw something special in the young man from Karlshamn. Judging by the incredible success Shellback has had since, Martin’s A&R skills are some of the best in the music business." Martin has a wife Jenny and daughter Doris born around 2001. Since 1999, Max Martin has written and co-written 21 Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits (most of which he has also produced or co-produced).
