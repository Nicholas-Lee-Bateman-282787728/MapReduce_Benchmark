    Mostyn Neil Hamilton (born 9 March 1949) is a British politician and former barrister, teacher, and Conservative MP for the Tatton constituency from 1983 to 1997. In 1997, after becoming involved in a political scandal known as the Cash-for-questions affair, Hamilton was defeated and left politics until 2011 when he was elected to the National Executive Committee of the UK Independence Party. Hamilton and his wife Christine became media celebrities. In Who's Who, Hamilton is described as a writer, actor, broadcaster and entertainer. Hamilton was born in Fleur-de-Lis, a Monmouthshire pit village near Blackwood,  Wales. His father was a chief engineer for the National Coal Board. His grandfathers were coal miners. Hamilton grew up in Ammanford in Carmarthenshire, West Wales. At the age of 15, in 1964, he joined the Conservative party. Hamilton attended Ammanford Grammar School. He received a bachelor of science degree in economics and politics (BScEcon) from the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, in 1970 and a master of science degree in economics and politics (MScEcon) in 1975.Aber Connect: Mr M N Hamilton While at Aberystwyth, Hamilton was active in the Federation of Conservative Students, (a member between 1968 and 1974). In 1973, as a representative of the Federation of Conservative Students, Hamilton addressed a conference of the Italian Social Movement (MSI). Hamilton went on to study at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,BBC News Election 97 (.) Accessed 23 May 2014 where he attained a post-graduate law degree. At the 1970 Conservative party conference, Hamilton called for mass privatisation. One year later, in 1971, he opposed Britain's joining the European Economic Community. In 1972, after several years' membership, Hamilton was elected to the executive council of the Conservative Monday Club. In 1973, he left the club and stood as chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students against David Davis and lost. In the early 1970s, Hamilton was a member of the Eldon League, a right-wing social organisation given to having picnics and dinners 'and having a good time'.Guy Rais, "Goose-step not backing Nazism says Tory MP", Daily Telegraph, 16 October 1986 Hamilton stood as the Conservative parliamentary candidate in the February 1974 general election in AbertilleryUK General Election results February 1974 at politicalresources.net and in the 1979 general election in Bradford North,UK General Election results May 1979 at politicalresources.net but failed on both occasions. Between 1973 and 1976, Hamilton was a teacher at St John's College (Portsmouth), Southsea. In his spare time, he studied for his bar practice exam. Hamilton also taught constitutional law at the Hatfield Polytechnic between September 1978 and July 1982. From September 1979, Hamilton practised as a barrister. He specialised in taxation law. However, after  Hamilton lost his parliamentary seat in 1997, he vowed never to return to "that constipated profession". In April 2001, Hamilton said, "If I am bankrupt, [which he was the following month] I won't be able to return to the bar but even if I was able to do so, I couldn't contain myself from saying what I thought to some of them judges." Hamilton was also European and Parliamentary Affairs Director of the Institute of Directors during this time.David Leigh & Ed Vulliamy, Sleaze, the Corruption of Parliament, pages 48/49, ISBN 185702-694-2 On 12 March 1983 Hamilton was selected as the Conservative candidate for the newly created Tatton constituency. Three months later, at the 1983 general election Hamilton was elected to Parliament as MP for Tatton. On entering the Commons, Hamilton was appointed as an officer on the backbench committee on Trade & Industry under the chairmanship of Michael Grylls. Leaded petrol In 1984, against party policy, Hamilton opposed the abandonment of leaded petrol in Britain. He argued there was no evidence that leaded petrol was damaging the environment and that jobs would be lost in his constituency if leaded petrol was banned. Western Goals Institute Hamilton resumed his activities as a supporter of pressure-groups, notably the Western Goals Institute, led by ex-Young Monday Club Chairman, Andrew V.R. Smith and attracting the support of other parliamentarians such as Sir Patrick Wall, Bill Walker, Nicholas Winterton and the Revd. Martin Smyth he was on their parliamentary advisory board.Labour Research, November 1988, p.2. The Western Goals Institute achieved notoriety by inviting French National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and Il Duce's granddaughter, Alessandra Mussolini (a Deputy sitting for the Italian neo-fascist Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI)), to address fringe meetings at the 1992 Conservative Party conference. The Conservative Party Chairman, Sir Norman Fowler was outraged and stated the Conservative Party was not related to the Western Goals Institute.  In the event the meetings were cancelled as neither le Pen nor Mussolini could come to Britain.Independent: Anti-fascists plan Tory protest, 30th September 1992 Hamilton also lent his support to the No Turning Back Group organised by his friend Michael Brown MP. Other MPs active in the No Turning Back Group included Michael Portillo, Peter Lilley, Alan Duncan and Gerald Howarth.David Leigh & Ed Vulliamy, Sleaze, the Corruption of Parliament, page 76, ISBN 185702-694-2 Ian Greer Associates In 1985, he began working for Ian Greer Associates, lobbying on behalf on US Tobacco.David Leigh & Ed Vulliamy, Sleaze, the Corruption of Parliament, pages 65/70, ISBN 185702-694-2 Hamilton, together with Michael Brown, became an enthusiastic supporter of US Tobacco's 'Skoal Bandits' product, a tea-bag type of pouch of tobacco designed for chewing. The product was believed to cause serious risk of oral cancer, particularly for minors, and the Government was inclined to ban its import. Hamilton claimed he supported the introduction of Skoal Bandits on libertarian grounds and lobbied ministers (including Edwina Curry and David Mellor) to allow its introduction. The House of Commons Select Committee on Standards investigation stated; "Mr Hamilton and Mr Brown had a number of contacts with Ministers and officials as part of their campaign to influence Government policy on Skoal Bandits" and that there was "no evidence ... that any appropriate declaration was made".Hansard: Select Committee on Standards and Privileges First Report: VI. SUMMARIZING THE EVIDENCE - Continued 7. ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO NON-DECLARATION OF INTERESTS b. The Campaign relating to Skoal Bandits Hamilton was obliged to concede he had been wrong to make no reference to the payment "when I went on those meetings with Ministers". Strategy Network International - Derek Laud In June 1990, Hamilton was recruited by the right-wing Monday Club activist Derek Laud to work for Strategy Network International, the firm specifically created to lobby against anti- apartheid movements, economic sanctions and for apartheid South Africa's 'transitional government' of Namibia set up in defiance of UN resolution 435 on Namibian independence. Derek Laud was an ex-Monday Club activist and protégé of Hamilton's friend, Michael Brown, who offered Hamilton a fee of £8,000 per year. Hamilton failed to registere the paid-for consultancy. Hamilton took free trips to South Africa in the company of Brown.Patricia Wynn Davies, "The Attack on Sleaze: How apartheid regime set out to woo Tories", The Independent, 26 October 1994David Leigh & Ed Vulliamy, Sleaze, the Corruption of Parliament, page 136, ISBN 185702-694-2Select Committee on Standards and Privileges First Report iv. STRATEGY NETWORK INTERNATIONAL, Hansard Thatcher leadership contest Thatcher made Hamilton whip in July 1990. In November 1990, Michael Heseltine initiated a leadership challenge to Margaret Thatcher. Despite being told by the Chief Whip to stay neutral, Hamilton claims he ignored this instruction. "I naturally ignored this advice and fed all my intelligence into her campaign." He claims too, to have made the fateful suggestion she interview each cabinet member individually, believing they would lack the resolve to tell her to her face, she must go. "Unfortunately, I had miscalculated."Neil Hamilton in Iain Dale (ed) Memories of Margaret Thatcher: A Portrait, By Those Who Knew Her Best (Biteback Publishing, 2013) ISBN 184954607X Hamilton strongly encouraged Thatcher to persist. At a meeting where Peter Lilley argued that Thatcher could not survive, Hamilton subjected him to a barrage of "sarcasm and heckling".Bruce Anderson, John Major – Making of the Prime Minister (1991) On 21 November 1990, Hamilton and like-minded colleagues met Thatcher at Downing Street. Thatcher did subsequently resign and Hamilton voted for John Major.Christine Hamilton's autobiography – 2005 John Major's Government From April 1992 to October 1994, Hamilton was the "minister for deregulation and corporate affairs"  in John Major's government. William Hague's leadership Following Hamilton's ejection from Tatton and the Conservative defeat in the 1997 election, the new party leader, William Hague, sought to distance the Conservative Party from the disgraced Hamilton and asked Hamilton to stay away from the party conference."Profile: Neil Hamilton", BBC News, 10 August 2001 Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty on 2 June 1992. Hamilton and some other conservative ministers had also opposed the treaty. Despite this, Hamilton remained, for a time, loyal to the Major government which endorsed the treaty. Hamilton urged his colleagues not to resign over the Treaty and other current issues. After Hamilton resigned in October 1994, he voted in a 1995 leadership ballot. Hamilton supported Michael Portillo, and when Portillo did not contest the leadership, he voted for John Redwood. Prior to the 1997 General Election, Hamilton determined to attempt to retain his parliamentary seat. His majority at the 1992 General Election had been almost 16,000 votes. In 1997, Tatton was the fourth safest Conservative seat in Britain. Hamilton was under investigation by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner (See The cash for questions enquiry, below) and some party members thought he should stand down after the collapse of his case against The Guardian.The 1997 General Election edited by D. T. Denver Page 83. ISBN 0714649090 Disquiet in the local association became public, but the majority gave him the benefit of the doubt."Neil Hamilton should step down as Knutsford's MP now, a true blue Tory argued this week", Warrington Guardian, 9 October 1996 Hamilton resisted the pressure from senior Conservatives and Conservative Central Office to stand down. Indeed, Jeremy Paxman states, Conservative Central Office "begged him not to stand, but in a gesture of overweening  arrogance, he refused to go quietly."Jeremy Paxman, The Political Animal,  2002, ISBN 9780141032962 On 8 April 1997, Hamilton was chosen as the Tory candidate for Tatton (182 for, 35 against, 100 abstained). The Observer commissioned ICM polls in the constituencies of the three Conservative candidates tainted by scandal and seeking re-election: Hamilton, Allan Stewart and Piers Merchant. Both Stewart and Merchant were found to have support consistent with their party's standing, but in Tatton, "there was massive hostility to Hamilton".Bruce Page, The Murdoch Archipelago, 2003, ISBN 9781849837798 When Martin Bell, a well-known BBC war correspondent, announced he would stand as an independent candidate in Tatton, the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates for the area stood down in order to give Bell a clear run against Hamilton. Bell trounced Hamilton, winning by a majority of over 11,000 votes with a swing of 48%. Although Hamilton vowed to return to parliament, this defeat marked the end of his political career in the Conservative Party. In March 1999, George Osborne was selected by the Tatton Conservative Association to be their candidate for the following general election. In September 2011, Hamilton attended the annual conference of the UK Independence Party and let it be known that he was available to assist it. The party's leader Nigel Farage pledged to support him in the election for the National Executive Committee. Hamilton was elected to the committee on 1 November 2011. He later become deputy chairman of the party."NEC", UKIP Hamilton was demoted from his role as campaign director in April 2014.Lucy Fisher, "Ukip demotes Neil Hamilton as party fears over sleaze grow." The Observer, p24, 20 April 2014. Accessed 23 May 2014. In the May 2014 local elections, he stood as a UKIP candidate in the St Mary's Park ward of Wandsworth London Borough Council and finished 8th of the 9 candidates with 396 votes.. On 30 January 1984, a Panorama programme, "Maggie's Militant Tendency", was broadcast. The programme made a number of allegations regarding Hamilton's past and more recent activities. These included his attending and giving a fraternal speech in 1972 to the Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI) an Italian neo-fascist party led by one of Benito Mussolini's ex-ministers, Giorgio Almirante,"Parliament Debate on Recommendation to Strip Msi Leader of His Immunity", JTA, 24 May 1973 Hamilton's membership of the Eldon League, and his involvement with the Powellite faction of the Monday Club and the far-right activist, George Kennedy Young, the former Deputy Director of MI6 and Chairman of the Society for Individual Freedom. The programme also made the claim that Hamilton gave a Nazi salute in Berlin while 'messing around' on a parliamentary visit in August 1983. A Nazi salute is a criminal offence in the Federal Republic of Germany.Robert Kahn, Holocaust Denial and the Law: A Comparative Study, p. 15. (2004) ISBN 9781403964762 In October 1986, Hamilton and his fellow MP Gerald Howarth (one of his closest friends), sued the BBC for libel along with Phil Pedley, a former chairman of the National Young Conservatives, who had appeared on the programme. The Guardian newspaper, highlighted Hamilton's admission in The Sunday Times in an article he wrote after the court case that he did give "a little salute with two fingers to his nose to give the impression of a toothbrush moustache." The prosecution was financed by Sir James GoldsmithMarcel Berlins "Price of backing a loser", The Guardian, 31 January 2000 and Taki, The Spectator columnist. David Davis, then a director of Tate and Lyle, persuaded that company to donate a sum to the cause. Lord Harris of High Cross (who helped to finance Hamilton's failed libel action against Mohammed Al-Fayed 13 years later), also raised approximately £100,000. During the case, Hamilton said he saw himself as being "the Mike Yarwood of the Federation of Conservative Students" Daily Telegraph, 17 October 1986 and that he frequently did impressions of public figures such as Frankie Howerd, Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, Charles De Gaulle and Enoch Powell. Hamilton claimed he had coloured himself black in 1982 to look like Idi Amin and dressed as Canon James Owen on a boat on the River Cam.The Daily Telegraph, October 1986 He claimed he would have twenty character witnesses: "My main character witness was going to be Norman St John Stevas."Neil Hamilton, Sunday Times News in Focus feature,  26 October 1986 In a Sunday Times article, Hamilton denied there was any malicious intent behind the salute. He also pointed out that one person present at the incident, Julian Lewis, was a Jew and that a "number of his relatives were killed by the Nazis during the war". BBC collapse In mid-trial and without cross-examining Hamilton, the BBC capitulated on 21 October 1986. The Director-General, Alasdair Milne, stated he was instructed to do so by the Governors of the BBC. The corporation was directed to pay the men's legal costs. Hamilton and Howarth were awarded £20,000 each and in the next edition of Panorama, on 27 October, the BBC made an unreserved apology.The Times, 28 October 1986 The settlement of the case raised serious concerns regarding political pressure and the intimidation of witnesses. Before the BBC defence lawyers had an opportunity to interrogate Hamilton, the Board of Governors met during the trial and instructed the BBC Board of Management to settle the case. "...the BBC executives at this meeting expressed serious doubts about the decision. It was pointed out the BBC had not even begun to put its case".Simon Freeman and Henry Porter, "BBC to settle Tory libel case", Sunday Times, 19 October 1986. The National Young Conservatives hinted at a stitch-up at the BBC. The chairman, Richard Fuller, told the Eastern Area Young Conservatives: "I find it strange that they have apparently decided to settle now, when things appeared to be going well."Peter Fiddick and Dennis Barker, "BBC in crisis over libel case deal", The Guardian, 20 October 1986 Attention focussed on the actions of Malcolm McAlpine, a cousin of Alistair McAlpine, the treasurer of the Conservative Party. "He denied yesterday that he had promised Mr Hamilton that he could "deliver" the governors behind a settlement." Witness allegations In the immediate aftermath of the BBC settlement, allegations of witness intimidation abounded. A BBC internal memorandum to the Board of Management claimed some 17 witnesses had been intimidated to change their testimony.Hamilton and Howarth v. British Broadcasting Corporation, Hansard, HC Deb 31 October 1986 vol 103 c272W A BBC source stated: "Nearly all the defence witnesses have had a quiet word in their ears. Only two or three people connected with Tory politics who would have given vital evidence for us now stick to their testimony. Some previously expressed disgust at incidents they had witnessed. Now they claim to have witnessed nothing."John Merritt, "Tories Nobble BBC Claim", The Daily Mirror, 20 October 1986Anne Spackman, "New evidence emerges in BBC Libel Case", The Independent, 25 October 1986 Howarth and Hamilton said the case against Pedley would not be dropped and Pedley said he would not be joining the BBC decision. The Financial Times reported, "A solicitor for Mr Hamilton and Mr Howarth said later that their linked libel action against Mr Philip Pedley... would continue. Mr Pedley indicated that he intends to continue the case." David Thomas, Raymond Hughes and Michael Cassall, "MP urges resignations at BBC after libel settlement", Financial Times, 22 October 1986. The media began to focus on the remaining unsettled case. The Guardian reported that "The spotlight had swivelled to Phil Pedley, the Tory defendant who remained adamant he would fight on alone, backed by independent funds and, he claims, a wide range of Conservative supporters.""Fighting on alone", The Guardian, 22 October 1986 Pedley did not name the supporters but the then chairman of the Young Conservatives, Richard Fuller, pledged financial support to the fight and in a meeting with Jeffrey Archer, Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party, Fuller resisted Archer's demand to back down.David Sapsted, "MP's get damages", The Times, 20 October 1986Dennis Barker and Peter Fiddick, "Young Tory in Archer Meeting", The Guardian, 21 October 1986 Labour accused Conservative Central Office of organising a cover up over claims that Hamilton had given a Nazi salute on a visit to Berlin and sought to question the then party chairman, Norman Tebbit.PMQs, Hansard, HC Deb, 21 October 1986 vol 102 cc940-6Ivor Owen, "Labour calls for statement on alleged libel case interference", Financial Times, 22 October 1986John Pienaar, "Tebbit leaning on Tories over BBC", The Independent, 22 October 1986 Dale Campbell-Savours claimed he had evidence in the form of a letter from Pedley to the former Party Chairman, John Selwyn Gummer, demonstrating Conservative Central Office (CCO) had contacted witnesses.BBC (Court Case), Hansard, HC Deb 23 October 1986 vol 102 cc1307-10 Tebbit confirmed one witness had been in touch with CCO. "I am aware that one potential witness sought advice from Central Office but was told that no advice could be given..."  Tebbit accused Campbell Savours of making his accusations behind the cloak of parliamentary privilege and left the chamber to make his reply. "My staff are appalled and disgusted. They are filled with contempt for a man who can make these sort of accusations of a criminal offence against a member of staff, who, Mr Campbell-Savours knows damn well, is not guilty of it." Anthony Bevins, "Top Tory named in BBC Row", The Independent, 24 October 1986Alan Travis, "Labour accuses Tories of Libel Pressure", The Guardian, 24 October 1986 On 25 October, the press reported new evidence of inappropriate witness contact.Anne Spackman, "New Evidence emerges in BBC libel case", The Independent, 25 October 1986 Later that day, Hamilton announced that he was dropping the action against Pedley. However Pedley reaffirmed he, "had no intention of withdrawing from the case."David Hencke, "MP drops Young Tory libel action", The Guardian, 27 October 1986 Hamilton's announcement failed to quell demands for an enquiry and Campbell-Savours denounced Tebbit's tactic of making his statements outside the House of Commons chamber, accusing him of "a deliberate ploy to avoid placing himself in contempt by misleading the House in a personal statement". He invited Tebbit to make a statement in the House."If he refuses, then the country will know that a conspiracy of silence is being engineered by senior figures to hide the truth."Anthony Bevans, "Tebbit challenged to make statement on BBC case", The Independent, 28 October 1986Alan Travis, "Tory Squeeze Claim", The Guardian, 28 October 1986 More information appeared in the press alleging witness interference, including the Hogan Memorandum, the internal BBC document listing the witnesses who had changed their account.Alan Travis, "Tory Squeeze claim", The Guardian, 28 October 1986 The Independent revealed the existence of a taped conversation of a Tory witness being 'shaken rigid' by Central Office's suggestion that the Berlin events had not happened and "no other witness would substantiate or give evidence about those alleged incidents" and the witness was told no other witness would back his account. The witness, said "this was like a bad dream."Anne Spackman and Anthony Bevins, "BBC witness shaken rigid", The Independent, 29 October 1986 Campbell-Savours claimed this was proof of BBC nobbling and announced that he was sending his evidence to Sir Michael Havers, the Attorney General.James Naughtie, "MP claims tape proof of BBC nobbling", The Guardian, 5 November 1986 In the Commons, Campbell-Savours stated: "Central Office set about an elaborate attempt to interfere directly with potential witnesses. Attempts were made to manage and rig statements by Mr. David Mitchell. I repeat what I have said previously, but additionally I am able to say today that there is a tape in existence that confirms the nature of the conspiracy to hide the truth, and which identifies persons. Today I have sent a transcript of that tape to the Attorney-General. I have to inform you, Mr. Speaker, that it is but one of two tapes. I await a transcript of the second tape." BBC Libel Action, Hansard, 4 November 1986 Statement contradictions Press interest turned to Hamilton's past statements about the Berlin visit, over which Tory witnesses were alleged to have been pressured to say that they had not seen goose-stepping or Nazi style salutes. Hamilton had given a categorical denial he had made a Nazi salute in Berlin to John Selwyn Gummer, the Party Chairman, in January 1984: "Dear John... I make it absolutely clear that, whilst in Berlin, I did not do any goose-stepping nor did I at any time give Nazi salutes. Indeed, I have always thought the latter was a criminal offence in the Federal Republic." But, writing in the Sunday Times, Hamilton admitted making "a little salute" in the Reichstag.Neil Hamilton News in Focus feature, Sunday Times, 26 October 1986David Leigh and Paul Lashmar, Nazi Salute storm refuses to die down", The Observer, 2 November 1986Paul Foot, "Spot the Goose", Daily Mirror, 3 November 1986 Hamilton's admission had the effect of reaffirming the testimony of the two witnesses who alleged he had given a Nazi salute in Berlin and exposing those witnesses who had reversed their position. Dropping of libel action against the Young Conservatives Hamilton and Howarth reversed their earlier position and dropped their libel action against Pedley. They said that extracting an apology from Pedley was not "worth the bother".The Times, 27 October 1986 On 3 December 1986, Pedley refused the offered settlement terms and asked for a hearing in open court. Justice Simon Brown ruled that Hamilton and Howarth be debarred from alleging Pedley's words were libel and should pay Pedley's costs.The Financial Times, 4 December 1986High Court written judgement, 14 July 1987 Pedley made a statement from the steps to say, he stood by his words in the Panorama programme and re-stated he had never said the MP's were Nazis, rather their behaviour was part of a pattern that would harm the Party and in the case of Hamilton's Berlin behaviour, the Final YC Report accused Hamilton of 'batty eccentricity.' On the more substantive allegations Pedley said he reiterated the points made in the YC Report had been called into question. 'I consider I have the responsibility to vindicate the good work done by the members of that committee. Several have endured abuse and hate mail following publication of their names in the Young National Front paper Bulldog and other extremist papers. I hope this will now cease, together with set-ups and the surveillance and harassment of other witnesses; in my case by private security companies.' Pedley Prepared Court Statement 3rd December 1986Time Out: A thoroughly moderate man 17th December 1986 In December 1986, Hamilton was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to David Mitchell.  On 20 October 1994, The Guardian published an article which claimed that Hamilton and another minister, Tim Smith, had received money, in the form of cash in brown envelopes. It claimed the money was paid to the men by Mohamed Al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods. In return, the men were to ask questions on behalf of Al-Fayed in the House of Commons. Smith admitted his guilt and resigned immediately. Hamilton claimed innocence but was forced to resign five days later, on 25 October 1994. Hamilton brought legal action for libel against The Guardian. Hamilton joined Ian Greer, a parliamentary lobbyist, as a co-plaintiff. In the process, the Bill of Rights 1689 was amended by the Defamation Act 1996 to allow statements made in Parliament to be questioned in court.Robert Shrimsley, "Guardian Case MP seeks law change", Financial Times, 15 February 1996Only Flattery is Safe': Political Speech and the Defamation Act 1996 On 30 September 1996, the day before the start of the trial, Hamilton and Greer settled, citing a conflict of interest and lack of funds. The Guardian greeted the Hamilton collapse with the headline 'A Liar and a Cheat'. Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, said, "The decision by Neil Hamilton and Ian Greer must be one of the most astonishing legal cave-ins in the history of the law of libel" and called for the issues to be examined by Sir Gordon Downey, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and the Inland Revenue.David Hencke, David Leigh and David Pallister, "A Liar and a Cheat", The Guardian, 1 October 1996The Guardian front page, 1 October 1996 They each paid £7,500 towards paper's legal costs. All the "cash-for-questions" evidence was sent to Sir Gordon Downey, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.BBC News Timeline of Hamilton Cash for Questions Case On 1 October 1996, Hamilton appeared on the evening television program, Newsnight, and engaged in a live debate with Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian. The "cash for questions" parliamentary enquiry took place in 1997, led by Downey. Hamilton vowed that if the "Downey report" found against him, he would resign. Edwina Currie, a former health minister, gave evidence. She told the inquiry that, in May 1988, Hamilton had been unmoved by a set of photographs that depicted smoking related cancers; that is, harm to young people which might be caused by a product (tobacco) that he promoted.The Independent, 5 July 1997 Hamilton argued the pictures were irrelevant. Both Hamilton and Michael Brown had received a £6,000 honorarium and hospitality from Skoal Bandits. In December 1989, the sale of Skoal Bandit products was banned in the UK by the Secretary of State for Health, Kenneth Clarke."Safety ban on Skoal Bandits", The Herald, 14 December 1989 Downey reported that he found the evidence against Hamilton in the case of Al-Fayed "compelling". Hamilton received over £25,000 and had deliberately misled Michael Heseltine, then President of the Board of Trade, in October 1994, when he said he had no financial relationship with Ian Greer. In a phone conversation, Hamilton gave an absolute assurance to Heseltine that there was no such relationship. In fact, he had received two payments from Greer in 1988 and 1989, totalling £10,000.The Independent, 4 July 1997 Hamilton had asked for payment in kind so the money would not be taxable. He also failed to register his stays at the Hôtel Ritz Paris and at Al-Fayed's castle in Scotland in 1989. On 3 July 1997, the enquiry found Hamilton guilty of taking "cash for questions". The Independent wrote, "Sir Gordon, contrary to Hamilton's confident expectations, had no compunction about concluding that he did indeed take cash in brown envelopes" and called the new Party Leader to "expel the miscreants".Donald McIntyre, "A clear response to the cash for questions MPs", The Independent, 4 July 1997 Hamilton, Smith (also found guilty), Brown and Michael Grylls were harshly criticised. If Hamilton and Smith had remained in parliament, Downey said he might have recommended long periods of suspension for both. Hamilton rejected these findings, whereas Smith, who had stood down, accepted them, apologised for his conduct, and retired from politics altogether. Hamilton also brought a legal action for libel against Mohamed Al-Fayed. On 16 January 1997, Al-Fayed appeared in an edition of the Dispatches documentary series on Channel 4."Appendix 33 - continued: Appendix 1 Channel 4 and Fourth Estate Press Releases", Select Committee on Standards and Privileges First Report, House of Commons, January 1997 He claimed that Hamilton had demanded and had accepted cash payments of up to £110,000,"Hamilton loses libel case", BBC News, 21 December 1999 Harrods' gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Hôtel Ritz Paris in 1987, in return for asking questions in Parliament on behalf of Harrods. While Hamilton did not deny the holiday, he continued to maintain that he was innocent of improper conduct. On 31 July 1998, Hamilton's action was approved for a court listing. Funds for the action were donated by Lord Harris of High Cross, the Earl of Portsmouth and Taki, who raised £50,000."The odd couple behind the odd couple", BBC News, 23 December 1999 Other contributors to the fund included Simon Heffer, Norris McWhirter, Peter Clarke, Lord Bell, Gyles Brandreth and Gerald Howarth (Hamilton's co-plaintiff in the BBC action). Some Tory MPs (approximately 40 of the 165) also made contributions. In total, approximately £410,000 was raised.The Independent, 23 December 1999 The jury trial commenced in November 1999. Hamilton and his wife were cross-examined by George Carman QC. Carman put to Hamilton that he had acted corruptly to demand and then take £10,000 from Mobil Oil in 1989 for the tabling of an amendment to a finance bill. At the time, Hamilton was a member of a Commons select committee on finance. Al-Fayed said Hamilton had taken the money either in brown envelope cash payments or through Ian Greer. Hamilton said in his own evidence: "I have never received a penny from Mr Fayed; I have never asked".Matt Wells "'I lacked candour but I am not corrupt'", The Guardian, 11 December 1999 His counsel, in the closing comments, argued that Al-Fayed's assertions had destroyed his client's reputation."Hamilton's 'tragedy' was to help Al Fayed", The Guardian, 16 December 1999 On 21 December 1999, the jury unanimously decided in favour of the defence.Matt Wells, et al "A greedy, corrupt liar", The Guardian, 22 December 1999 A year later, Hamilton lost an appeal against his loss of the libel case."Neil Hamilton loses libel appeal", theguardian.com. 21 December 2000 On 14 October 1997, Hamilton made an appeal to a new committee. On 6 November, the committee only partially endorsed Downey's report, but still criticised Hamilton's behaviour whilst an MP. In April 2001, Hamilton was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. On 22 May 2001, unable to pay his legal fees and with costs amounting to some £3m, Hamilton declared bankruptcy. He was discharged from bankruptcy in May 2004. On 10 August 2001, the Hamiltons were arrested by police who were investigating an alleged rape.  The Hamiltons claimed they could not have been present at the alleged rape scene because they were hosting a dinner party and produced alibis including Derek Laud.Tara Womersley and Peter Foster, "Dinner guests whose testimony will count", Daily Telegraph, 13 August 2001 The investigation against the couple was dropped when it became apparent that the accusations were entirely false. This event was recorded on film by Louis Theroux, who, at that time, was embedded with the Hamiltons for an episode of his documentary series When Louis Met.... In June 2003, the woman who had fabricated the accusation of rape, Nadine Milroy-Sloan, was sentenced to three years in jail for perverting the course of justice. In February 2005, the publicist Max Clifford, who had acted for Milroy-Sloan, settled, paying Hamilton an undisclosed sum.  On 9 May 1997 Hamilton and his wife, Christine, appeared on the current affairs satire quiz Have I Got News for You. The episode was recorded one week after Hamilton lost his seat. Angus Deayton, the presenter of the panel game, wore a white suit instead of his usual brown one. This was a humorous reference to Martin Bell, who wore just such a suit throughout the 1997 general election campaign. As a further taunt, at the end of the show, the Hamiltons were handed their "fee" in brown envelopes. At one point Hamilton quipped, "I've found it's much better making political jokes than being one." Since then, the Hamiltons have appeared on chat shows. They have also appeared on programmes such as The Weakest Link and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, as well as in pantomime. In an appearance on a celebrity edition of Mastermind on Boxing Day 2004, Hamilton described himself as being "an object of professional curiosity". He appeared in Da Ali G Show in 2000. Hamilton  holds strong conservative views. He has opposed trade unions, immigration and child benefits. He supports free market economics, privatisation of public bodies and the continuance of capital punishment. Hamilton was in favour of coal mine closures and the development of nuclear power as an alternative. He also encouraged the preservation of the Welsh national language. Hamilton argued for the individual's right to smoke. He was the only member in committee to oppose the Conservative government's bill to outlaw trafficking in human organs.Robert Barr (Associated Press), "London Kidneys-for-Cash Scandal Prompts Action to Ban Sale of Organs", Los Angeles Times, 16 July 1989 In April 1986, Hamilton was one of ten MPs to vote against the government on an EEC bill. Hamilton was a member of the "No Turning Back group", a part of the Conservative Party calling for the privatisation of schools and the National Health Service, which he described as "vast monoliths". Hamilton was a provocative and outspoken parliamentarian. He was combative in the House of Commons. In November 1989, Hamilton won the Spectator parliamentary wit of the year award. He jokingly remarked that when told of winning the award, he thought it was for being the "Twit of the year".The Times, 22 October 1994 His "wit" was frequently controversial. During a debate about amputees he said that Frank Dobson "does not have a leg to stand on". (January 1987). To Jeremy Corbyn he suggested that "some of [his] IRA friends could be used to get rid of pensioners by shooting them" also in 1987. On 4 June 1983, five days before polling day in the 1983 general election, Hamilton married Mary Christine Holman in Cornwall. She was the secretary to Tory MP Michael Grylls.Andrew Roth, "Sir Michael Grylls: Conservative MP exposed in cash-for-questions investigation" (obituary), The Guardian, 24 February 2001 In September 2003, after having one of their homes in the Tatton constituency for twenty years, the Hamiltons moved to Hullavington, Wiltshire.
