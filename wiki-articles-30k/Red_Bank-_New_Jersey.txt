Red Bank was originally formed as a town on March 17, 1870, from portions of Shrewsbury Township. On February 14, 1879, Red Bank became Shrewsbury City, a portion of Shrewsbury Township, but this only lasted until May 15, 1879, when Red Bank regained its independence. On March 10, 1908, Red Bank was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature and was set off from Shrewsbury Township.Snyder, John P.

Occupied by indigenous peoples for thousands of years, in historic times the area of modern-day Red Bank was the territory of the Algonquian-speaking Lenape Native Americans, also called the Delaware by the English. The Lenape lived in the area between the Navesink River and the Shrewsbury River in an area that they called Navarumsunk. The Native Americans traded freely with European settlers from England and the Dutch Republic in the mid-17th century, who purchased land in the area.Sullivan, Joseph F. "Metropolitan Baedeker: Around Red Bank and the Navesink". The New York Times. October 15, 1976. Accessed July 10, 2012.

Borough of Red Bank. Accessed July 11, 2012. Red Bank was settled by English colonists beginning in the 17th century and became a center for shipbuilding. Its population grew rapidly after 1809, when regularly scheduled passenger ships were established to serve the route to Manhattan. By 1844, Red Bank had become a commercial and manufacturing center, focused on textiles, tanning, furs, and other goods for sale in Manhattan. With the dredging of the Navesink River about 1845, Red Bank became a port from which steamboats transported commuters to work in Manhattan. Red Bank grew in size as a result of this, as well as the effects of construction of a railway in the town by the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad in 1860.Staff.

"It being the occasion of the opening of the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad, to Long Branch, the City Guard accepted the invitation of the Railroad Company to pass over their road and join in the opening celebration at the same time that they celebrated their own anniversary.... The Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad, it may be proper to state here, was projected to run to Cabe May, and to form part of an air-line from New-York to Norfolk, a distance of 300 miles, 250 of which is to be by rail and the remainder by water." During the 20th century, Red Bank was a strong cultural, economic, and political center in Monmouth County, until it was hindered by the economic recession that began in 1987. During this time, Red Bank's economy, based largely on retail commerce, was in decline, due to a real estate scandal.  Local pundits and urban planners referred to the town as "Dead Bank".James, George (June 17, 2001). "COMMUNITIES; From Dead Bank To Red Bank". The New York Times. Accessed May 9, 2012. Quote: "It was the mid 1980's, and downtown stores were being forced out of business by the invasion of sprawling new malls, the population was slipping and the commercial and residential tax base was eroding. Red Bank was known as Dead Bank." Beginning in approximately 1991, under the New Jersey Development and Redevelopment Law, the borough authorized the creation of the Red Bank RiverCenter to manage redevelopment in what was designated as a special improvement district. RiverCenter retains authority over the management and redevelopment of a defined central business district, which includes Broad Street from the post office to Marine Park and from Maple Avenue to one block east of Broad Street. A number of urban redevelopment projects have taken place, including improved signage, distinctive and pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and lighting, a coherent design plan for Main Street and other major thoroughfares, improved condition of parking lots with landscaping, and similar projects.Red Bank, New Jersey Travel and Vacation Information.

The proposed district was amended to exclude opponents, and the district that was adopted stops at Maple Avenue.Burton, John.

The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.Cerra, Michael F.
