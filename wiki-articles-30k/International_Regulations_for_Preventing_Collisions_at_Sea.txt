    The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (Colregs) are published by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and set out, among other things, the "rules of the road" or navigation rules to be followed by ships and other vessels at sea to prevent collisions between two or more vessels.Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (COLREGs), from the IMO (The International Maritime Organisation). Retrieved 13 February 2006.Prevention of Collisions at Sea Regulations 1983, from Western Australian Legislation. Retrieved 6 June 2009. COLREGs can also refer to the specific political line that divides inland waterways, which are subject to their own navigation rules, and coastal waterways which are subject to international navigation rules. The COLREGs are derived from a multilateral treaty called the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. Although rules for navigating vessels inland may differ, the international rules specify that they should be as closely in line with the international rules as possible. In most of continental Europe, the Code Européen des Voies de la Navigation Intérieure (CEVNI, or the European Code for Navigation on Inland Waters) apply. In the United States, the rules for vessels navigating inland are published alongside the international rules.Navigation Rules, from the U.S. Coast Guard. Retrieved 16 December 2006. The Racing Rules of Sailing, which govern the conduct of yacht and dinghy racing under the sanction of national sailing authorities which are members of the International Sailing Federation (ISAF), are based on the COLREGs, but differ in some important matters such as overtaking and right of way close to turning marks in competitive sailing. Prior to the development of a single set of international rules and practices, there existed separate practices and various conventions and informal procedures in different parts of the world, as advanced by various maritime nations. As a result, there were inconsistencies and even contradictions that gave rise to unintended collisions. Vessel navigation lights for operating in darkness as well as navigation marks also were not standardised, giving rise to dangerous confusion and ambiguity between vessels at risk of colliding. With the advent of steam-powered ships in the mid-19th&nbsp;century, conventions for sailing vessel navigation had to be supplemented with conventions for power-driven vessel navigation. Sailing vessels are limited as to their manoeuvrability in that they cannot sail directly to windward or into the eye of the wind and cannot be readily navigated in the absence of wind. On the other hand, steamships can manoeuvre in all 360 degrees of direction and can be manoeuvred irrespective of the presence or absence of wind. In 1840 in London, the Trinity House drew up a set of regulations which were enacted by Parliament in 1846. The Trinity House rules were included in the Steam Navigation Act 1846, and the Admiralty regulations regarding lights for steam ships were included in this statute in 1848. In 1849 Congress extended the light requirements to sailing vessels on US&nbsp;waters. In the UK in 1858 coloured sidelights were recommended for sailing vessels and fog signals were required to be given, by steam vessels on the ships whistle and by sailing vessels on the fog horn or bell, while a separate but similar action was also taken in the United States. In 1850, English maritime Law was being adopted in the United States. Also in 1850, courts in the England and the United States adopted common law pertaining to reasonable speed within the Assured Clear Distance Ahead. In 1863 a new set of rules drawn up by the British Board of Trade, in consultation with the French government, came into force. By 1864 the regulations (or Articles) had been adopted by more than thirty maritime countries, including Germany and the United States (passed by the United States Congress as Rules to prevent Collisions at Sea. An act fixing certain rules and regulations for preventing collisions on the water. 29 April 1864, ch. 69.Library of Congress. Statutes at Large, 1789–1875. http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwsllink.html and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln). In 1867, Thomas Gray, assistant secretary to the Maritime Department of the Board of Trade, wrote The Rule of the Road, a pamphlet that became famous for its well-known mnemonic verses. In 1878, the United States codified its common law rules for preventing collisions. In 1880, the 1863 Articles were supplemented with whistle signals and in 1884 a new set of international regulations was implemented. In 1889 the United States convened the first international maritime conference in Washington, D.C. The resulting rules were adopted in 1890 and effected in 1897. Some minor changes were made during the 1910 Brussels Maritime Conference and some rule changes were proposed, but never ratified, at the 1929 International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea&nbsp;(S.O.L.A.S.) With the recommendation that the direction of a turn be referenced by the rudder instead of the helm or tiller being informally agreed by all maritime nations in 1935. The 1948 S.O.L.A.S. International Conference made several recommendations, including the recognition of radar these were eventually ratified in 1952 and became effective in 1954. Further recommendations were made by a S.O.L.A.S. Conference in London in 1960 which became effective in 1965 The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea were adopted as a convention of the International Maritime Organization on 20 October 1972 and entered into force on 15 July 1977. They were designed to update and replace the Collision Regulations of 1960, particularly with regard to Traffic Separation Schemes&nbsp;(TSS) following the first of these, introduced in the Strait of Dover in 1967. As of June 2013, the convention has been ratified by 155 states representing 98.7% of the tonnage of the world's merchant fleets.Ratification status of IMO Conventions. They have been amended several times since their first adoption. In 1981 Rule&nbsp;10 was amended with regard to dredging or surveying in traffic separation schemes. In 1987 amendments were made to several rules, including rule&nbsp;1(e) for vessels of special construction; rule&nbsp;3(h), vessels constrained by her draught and Rule&nbsp;10(c), crossing traffic lanes. In 1989 Rule&nbsp;10 was altered to stop unnecessary use of the inshore traffic zones associated with TSS. In 1993 amendments were made concerning the positioning of lights on vessels. In 2001 new rules were added relating to wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) craft and in 2007 the text of Annex&nbsp;IV (Distress signals) was rewritten. Each country that is a member of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) designates an "administration" or national authority or agency for implementing the provisions of the COLREG convention as it applies to vessels over which the national authority has jurisdiction. In other words, the IMO convention including the almost four dozen "rules" contained in the international regulations is adopted by each member country signatory to the convention. Each national administration is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the regulations as it applies to ships and vessels over which it has legal authority. For example, the US&nbsp;Coast Guard regulates US&nbsp;vessels, while Transport Canada regulates Canadian vessels. In effect, there is a set of national navigation laws (regulations) which conform to the international convention. Each administration is empowered to enact modifications that apply to vessels in waters under the national jurisdiction concerned, provided that any such modifications are not inconsistent with the COLREGs. The full text of the current rules is available from various national administration websites. Typically, the COLREGs are incorporated within national regulatory instruments "by reference". There are multiple books in many languages that not only provide the rules, but also provide discussion and examples related to interpreting the raw rules, including diagrams and hypothetical cases. The UK&nbsp;version is provided by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency&nbsp;(MCA). The COLREGs are contained within the Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations of 1996 as amended from time to time and is distributed and accessed in the form of a "Merchant Shipping Notice"&nbsp;(MSN), which is used to "convey mandatory information that must be complied with under UK legislation. These MSNs relate to Statutory Instruments and contain the technical detail of such regulations." Material published by the MCA is subject to Crown copyright protection, but the Marine and Coastgardit allow it to be reproduced free of charge in any format or medium for research or private study, provided it is reproduced accurately and not used in a misleading context. The summary below is based upon but is not identical to the published text. The rules are specified in great detail in the regulations. Certain individuals are legally required to carry or possess a copy of the rules, such as the owners and/or operators of certain vessels. COLREG laws exist within each maritime jurisdiction. Any individual subject to such requirements should be aware of the complete, official wording. Copies are available from government and official sources, such as the Coast Guard in the United States. In addition to the actual rules, a body of legal precedents and case law exists; judgements on the application of the various rules with respect to specific legal and admiralty court cases have been published. Such precedents of judicial interpretation provide guidance as to how the rules were deemed to have applied given specific facts, often with a view to apportioning contributory liability or blame. A commonly held misconception concerning the rules of marine navigation is that by following specific rules, a vessel can gain certain rights of way over other vessels. No vessel ever has absolute "right of way" over other vessels. Rather, there can be a "give way" (burdened) vessel and a "stand on" (privileged) vessel, or there may be two give way vessels with no stand on vessel. A stand on vessel does not have an absolute right of way over any give way vessel, for if there is a risk of collision, a stand on vessel may still be obliged under Rule&nbsp;2 to give way so as to avoid it, if doing so will be effective and is practicable. Two power-driven vessels approaching each other head to head, are both deemed to be "give way" and both are required to alter course so as to avoid colliding with the other. Neither vessel has "right of way". [Rule 2 is sometimes referred to as the "General Prudential" rule and provides for non-conformance with stated rules to prevent a collision, because what is paramount is to avoid or minimise the damaging effects of a collision, as opposed to blindly following the rules to the letter. The overall intent is to minimise actual collision taking place rather than rule compliance in and of itself, per&nbsp;se.] For the purpose of these Rules, except where the context otherwise requires: (a) The word “vessel” includes every description of water craft, including non-displacement craft, wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) vehicle, and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.

(k) Vessels shall be deemed to be in sight of one another only when one can be observed visually from the other. (l) The term "restricted visibility" means any condition in which visibility is restricted by fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, sandstorms, or other similar causes. (m) The term "Wing-In-Ground (WIG) craft" means a multimodal craft which, in its main operational mode, flies in close proximity to the surface by utilising surface-effect action. In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account: (a) By all vessels: * (i) the state of visibility; * (ii) the traffic density including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels; * (iii) the maneuvrability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions; * (iv) at night the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of her own lights; * (v) the state of wind, sea and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards; * (vi) the draught in relation to the available depth of water.

Attention is drawn to the relevant sections of the International Code of Signals, the Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual, Annex III and the following signals; (a) a piece of orange-coloured canvas with either a black square and circle or other appropriate symbol (for identification from the air); (b) a dye marker.   Light type Vessels  or more in length Vessels between  in length Vessels less than  in length Masthead light 6 nautical miles 5 miles; except for vessels less than , 3 miles 2 miles Sidelight 3 miles 2 miles 1 mile Towing light 3 miles 2 miles 2 miles White, red, green or yellow all-around light 3 miles 2 miles 2 miles (a) These rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels. (b) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of special rules made by an appropriate authority for roadsteads, harbours, rivers, lakes, or inland waterways connected with the high seas and navigable by seagoing vessels. Such special rules shall conform as closely as possible to these Rules. (c) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rule made by the government of any State with respect to additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or with respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape, or signal authorised elsewhere under these Rules (d) Traffic separation schemes may be adopted by the Organization for the purpose of these Rules. (e) Whenever the Government concerned shall have determined that a vessel of any special construction or purpose cannot comply with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range, or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, such vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, as her Government shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules in respect of that vessel. (a) Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these Rules or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case (b) In construing and complying with these rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the vessels involved, which may make a departure from these rules necessary to avoid immediate danger The rules apply in any condition of visibility (e.g.,&nbsp;in sight or in restricted visibility). Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision. Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions. Vessels must use all available means to determine the risk of a collision, including the use of radar (if available) to get early warning of the risk of collision by radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects. (e.g. ARPA, AIS). If the distance of any vessel is reducing and her compass bearing is not changing much or it is a large vessel or towing vessel at close distance, or if there is any doubt, then a risk of collision shall be deemed to exist. Actions taken to avoid collision should be: * positive * obvious * made in good time * A vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to starboard. * Small vessels or sailing vessels must not impede (larger) vessels which can navigate only within a narrow channel. * Ships must not cross a channel if to do so would impede another vessel which can navigate only within that channel. Ships must cross traffic lanes steering a course "as nearly as practicable" at right angles to the direction of traffic. This reduces confusion and enables that vessel to cross the lane as quickly as possible. Vessel entering a traffic separation scheme should do it at an angle as small as practicable. A traffic separation scheme does not relieve any vessel from complying with other rules. The following rules 11–18 applies to vessels in sight of one another. (Section&nbsp;III has specific requirements for restricted visibility) Two sailing vessels approaching one another must give-way as follows: * Port gives way to starboard. When each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind to port must give way; * Windward gives way to leeward. When both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is windward must give way to the vessel which is leeward; * Unsure port gives way. If a vessel, with the wind on the port side, sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine whether the other vessel has the wind on the port or the starboard side, they must give way. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules ...   ... an overtaking vessel must keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken. "Overtaking" means approaching another vessel at more than 22.5&nbsp;degrees abaftAbaft the beam is a nautical term denoting a relative bearing greater than 90&nbsp;degrees from the bow. her beam, i.e.,&nbsp;so that at night, the overtaking vessel would see only the stern light and neither of the sidelights of the vessel being overtaken.   Note that the opening words of this rule make clear that this rule overrides all other rules. When two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard so that they pass on the port side of the other. "Head-on" means seeing the other vessel ahead or nearly ahead so that by night her masthead lights are actually or nearly lined up and/or seeing both her sidelights, or by day seeing a similar aspect of her.  "If you see three lights ahead, starboard wheel and show your red." When two power-driven vessels are crossing, the vessel which has the other on the starboard side must give way and avoid crossing ahead of her. The saying is "If to starboard red appear, 'tis your duty to keep clear". "...Act as judgement says is proper: port or starboard, back or stop her." The give-way vessel must take early and substantial action to keep well clear. The stand-on vessel shall maintain her course and speed, but she may take action to avoid collision if it becomes clear that the give-way vessel is not taking appropriate action, or when so close that collision can no longer be avoided by the actions of the give-way vessel alone. In a crossing situation, the stand-on vessel should avoid turning to port even if the give-way vessel is not taking appropriate action. These options for the stand-on vessel do not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligations under the rules. Except in narrow channels, traffic separation schemes, and when overtaking (i.e.,&nbsp;rules 9, 10, and 13) * A power-driven vessel must give way to: ** a vessel not under command; ** a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre (this may include vessels towing one another); ** a vessel engaged in fishing; ** a sailing vessel. * A sailing vessel must give way to: ** a vessel not under command; ** a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre; ** a vessel engaged in fishing. * A vessel engaged in fishing when underway shall, so far as possible, keep out of the way of: ** a vessel not under command; ** a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre. * Any vessel other than a vessel not under command or a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre shall, if possible, not impede the safe passage of a vessel constrained by her draft, exhibiting the signals in Rule&nbsp;28. * A vessel constrained by her draft shall navigate with particular caution having full regard to her special condition. (a) Rule 19 applies to vessels (not in sight of one another) in or near restricted visibility. (b) All ships shall proceed at a safe speed for the condition of visibility (see Rule 6). A power-driven vessel shall have her engine(s) on stand-by for immediate maneuver. (c) All ships shall comply with Section&nbsp;I of this Part e.g.,&nbsp;Rules 5 (lookout), 6 (safe speed), 7 (risk of collision), 8 (action to avoid collisions), 9 (narrow channels), and 10 (TSS) with due regard for the visibility conditions. (d) If another vessel is detected by radar alone, and a close-quarters or collision risk is suspected, a vessel should take early and substantial action to avoid the other, but: (i) avoid any turn to port for a vessel detected forward of the beam, except for a vessel being overtaken, (ii) avoid any change of course toward a vessel abeam or abaft the beam. When the fog signal of another vessel is heard, apparently forward of the beam, a vessel should reduce speed to the minimum at which she can maintain her course, or if necessary stop, and navigate with extreme caution until there is no risk of collision. Rules concerning lights apply from sunset to sunrise, in conditions of restricted visibility, and in all other circumstances when it is deemed necessary. Rules concerning shapes apply during the day. "Masthead light" means a white light on the centreline of the vessel showing from right ahead to 22.5&nbsp;degrees abaft the beam on either side of the vessel. "Sidelights" means a green light on the starboard side and a red light on the port side each showing from right ahead to 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on its respective side. If the vessel is less than  long, the sidelights may be combined in one fixture carried on the centreline of the vessel. "Sternlight" means a white light placed as nearly as practicable at the stern showing 67.5&nbsp;degrees from right aft on each side of the vessel. "Towing light" means a yellow light having the same characteristics as a "sternlight" defined above. "All-round light" means a light visible from 360&nbsp;degrees of the horizon. "Flashing light" means a light flashing faster than 120 flashes per minute. "Long tow" means that the distance between the stern of the towing vessel and the after end of the towed vessel is more that 200 meters (often described as 600 feet in US publications). Lights must be bright enough to be visible as follows * A power-driven vessel underway must display: ** a masthead light forward; ** If over  length, then also a second masthead light aft and higher than the forward one; except that a vessel of less than 50 metres in length shall not be obliged to exhibit such light but may do so; ** sidelights; ** a sternlight. * A hovercraft must also display an all-round flashing yellow light. * A wing-in-ground craft must also display a bright all-round flashing red light when taking off, landing, or flying near the surface. * A power-driven vessel of less than  may display only an all-round white light and sidelights. However, in the case of a skiff a wooden clinker rowing boat which falls into this category only needs to be capable of showing a white light. * A power-driven vessel of less than  whose maximum speed does not exceed  must be capable of showing a white light * A power driven vessel when towing must show ** two masthead lights on top of each other, instead of the masthead(s) prescribed in Rule 23; *** for a "long tow", three masthead lights on top of each other, instead of two, and a diamond shape. ** sidelights; ** a sternlight; ** a towing light vertically above the sternlight; * if a pushing vessel and the vessel it is pushing are rigidly connected, they count together as a power driven vessel and must show the light prescribed by Rule 23. * If the pushing vessel and vessel being pushed are not rigidly connected, they must instead show: ** two masthead lights on top of each other, instead of the masthead(s) prescribed in Rule 23; ** sidelights; ** a sternlight on the pushing vessel only. * Power driven vessels larger than  which are towing or pushing and are not part of a composite unit must also show: ** a second masthead abaft of and higher than the forward one (vessels smaller than 50 metres may also show this light). * Vessels being towed that are not inconspicuous or partly submerged must show: ** sidelights; ** a sternlight; ** a diamond shape if the tow is longer than . * Any number of vessels being towed or pushed together shall be lit as one vessel, and ** a vessel being pushed ahead must show sidelights at its forward end if it is not part of a composite unit; ** a vessel being towed alongside must show a sternlight and sidelights at its forward end. * A vessel being towed that is inconspicuous or partly submerged must show: ** if it is narrower than , one all-round white light near the forward end (except if it is a dracone) and one near the after end; ** if it is wider than , then also two all round white lights at the extremities of its breadth; ** if it is longer than , then in a series of such all round white lights spaced no further than  apart; ** a diamond shape near the end of the last vessel, and, if the tow is longer than , another diamond shape as far forward as possible. ** If for any reason it is not possible to light the vessel according to these rules, all possible measures must be taken to light the vessel and indicate its presence. ** If the towing vessel is not normally engaged in towing operations and it is impractical to light it correctly, it is not obliged to show these lights if it is towing a vessel in distress or in need of assistance. All possible measures must be taken to show that it is towing; in particular the towline should be illuminated. A vessel constrained by her draft may, in addition to the lights prescribed for power-driven vessels in Rule 23, exhibit where they can best be seen three all-round red lights in a vertical line, or a cylinder. (a) A vessel engaged on pilotage duty shall exhibit: # at or near the masthead, two all-round lights in a vertical line, the upper being white and the lower red; # when underway, in addition, sidelights and a sternlight; # when at anchor, in addition to the lights prescribed in subparagraph (1), the light, lights, or shape prescribed in Rule 30 for vessels at anchor. (b) A pilot vessel when not engaged on pilotage duty shall exhibit the lights or shapes prescribed for a similar vessel of her length. * A vessel at anchor must display an all-round white light or one black ball in the fore part and another all-round white light at or near the stern at a lower level than the light in the fore part. BUT if the vessel is less than 50 meters in length it may exhibit an all-round white light where it can best be seen instead of the lights foresaid. Where it is impracticable for a seaplane or a WIG craft to exhibit lights and shapes of the characteristics or in the positions prescribed in the Rules of the Part she shall exhibit lights and shapes as closely similar in characteristics and position as is possible. short blast (1 second), and prolonged blast (4–6 seconds). Vessels  or more in length should carry a whistle and a bell and vessels  or more in length should carry in addition a gong. On many vessels, a horn serves the purpose of a whistle. The signals are used when vessels are in sight of one another The signals are used when vessels are in restricted visibility.
