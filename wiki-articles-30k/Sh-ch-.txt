     is a Japanese distilled beverage less than 45% alcohol by volume. It is typically distilled from  rice (kome), barley (mugi), sweet potatoes (imo), buckwheat (soba), or brown sugar (kokutō), though it is sometimes produced from other ingredients such as chestnut, sesame seeds, potatoes or even carrots. Typically shōchū contains 25% alcohol by volume, which is weaker than whisky or standard-strength vodka but stronger than wine and sake. It is not uncommon for multiple-distilled shōchū, which is more likely to be used in mixed drinks, to contain up to 35% alcohol by volume. Shōchū originated in Kyūshū but is produced in locations throughout Japan. Linguistically, the word shōchū is the Japanese rendition of the Chinese  (pinyin: shāojiǔ), which means "burned liquor".  However, today the word is written 焼酎 in Japanese. Shōchū should not be confused with sake, a brewed rice wine. Its taste is usually far less fruity and depends strongly on the nature of the starch used in the distilling process. Its flavor is often described as "nutty" or "earthy". Shōchū is drunk in many ways according to season or personal taste: neat, i.e., on its own with nothing added. on the rocks, i.e., mixed with ice diluted with room temperature or hot waterJoe, Melinda, "How I learned to stop worrying and love the shochu", Japan Times, 11 May 2012, p. 13 ('''mizuwari''<nowiki/>' or '<nowiki/>''oyuwari''<nowiki/>', respectively) * mixed with [[oolong]] tea or fruit juice * as [[chūhai]], a mixed drink consisting of shōchū, soda, ice and some flavoring, often [[lemon]], [[grapefruit]], [[apple]] or [[ume]] * mixed with a low-alcohol beer-flavored beverage known as [[hoppy (beverage)|hoppy]]  Shōchū is widely available in supermarkets, liquor stores and convenience stores in [[Japan]] while canned chuhai drinks are sold in some of Japan's ubiquitous vending machines. However, it is more difficult to find shōchū outside Japan except in urban areas with large enough Japanese populations. Interest in shōchū has begun to grow in North America, particularly in cosmopolitan cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, and New York. Dedicated shōchū bars have begun to appear in New York and more than 100 brands are now available in the U.S. market.<ref>http://kampai.us/</ref>  In Kyūshū, the center of production, shōchū is far more common than sake. Indeed, here ''sake'' generally means shōchū, and is normally consumed mixed with hot water. First hot water is poured into the glass, then shōchū is gently added. The liquids mix naturally and stirring is unnecessary. Typically, the amount of shōchū exceeds the amount of hot water, and is enjoyed for its aroma. Occasionally, shōchū and water are mixed, left to stand for a day, and then gently heated.  ===Boom=== The early 21st century witnessed a consumer boom in shōchū within Japan, and in 2003 domestic shipments surpassed those of sake for the first time.<ref name="japantimes">{{cite web|title=Shochu|first=Masami|last=Ito|publisher=The Japan Times|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/print/features/life2004/fl20040530x1.htm|accessdate = 2007-01-01}}</ref> Shōchū [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] appeared serving shōchū exclusively, and premium brands with a focus on particular ingredients, production methods, or aging techniques entered the market. The beverage has undergone change of image; formerly it was seen as an old fashioned drink, but now has become trendy amongst young drinkers, particularly women.<ref name="japantimes"/>  The boom also had negative effects: It caused a serious shortage of sweet potatoes, a basic ingredient of some popular types of shōchū and, with the emergence of expensive premium brands, pricing scams appeared.<ref name="japantimes"/>  In 2005 the Japanese television drama ''[[Kiken na Aneki]]'' illustrated this change in drinking habits.  Its plot centered on the Minagawa family of Miyazaki province, who were brewers of a sweet potato shōchū called [[Shōchū#Potato shōchū|imojōchū]].   The lead character Hiroko ([[Ito Misaki]]) spends the majority of the series trying to come up with enough money to save the brewery from loan sharks, but in the process becomes involved with corporate distilleries.  The larger companies formulate an advertising campaign that results in the imojōchū becoming a popular drink.  In this fictional account the beverage is marketed to young women, when it previously had been mostly consumed by the older male generation.  There are several reasons for shōchū's recent popularity.   With increasing health-consciousness, many people see it as more healthy than some alternatives. There have been well-publicized claims of medical benefits, including that it can be effective in preventing [[thrombosis]], heart attacks, and diabetes. It is also a versatile drink that is suited to most styles of cuisine.<ref name="japantimes"/><ref name="fukuoka">{{cite web|title=Kyushu's Spirit - Shochu |url=http://www.fukuoka-now.com/features/article_display.php?fn_code=429082 |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060217025854/http://www.fukuoka-now.com:80/features/article_display.php?fn_code=429082 |archivedate=February 17, 2006 }}</ref>  [[Shigechiyo Izumi]], a Japanese citizen who claimed to have been 120 years old (but only lived to be 105{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}), made shōchū part of his daily dietary regimen.

Until the 2006 revision the law referred to this category as {{nihongo|'''kōrui shōchū'''|焼酎甲類|shōchū kōrui|"[[Celestial stem|Class A]] shōchū"}}, sometimes abbreviated to "kōshu". Very sweet varieties of shōchū imported from Korea have recently grown in popularity and fall into this category (see [[soju]]).  It is generally distilled from a fermented liquid similar to molasses. Repeated distillation forms [[ethyl alcohol]] of high purity which is typically odorless and has a taste of little distinction. Water is then added, and the precise nature of this water has subtle effects on the taste and palatability of the shōchū.  Shōchū kōrui is made from sweet potato, potato, and corn. It is generally produced in modern large factories. Distillers make shōchū kōrui by weakening the distilled alcohol.  The specialized distillation equipment, called a [[patent still]] lends it to mass production at low cost, so large corporations produce this kind of shōchū in high volume. In Japan it retails in plastic bottle, can, and [[paper cup]] form and is consumed as a cheap alcoholic drink. It forms the base of several [[cocktail]]s and [[liqueur]]s such as [[chūhai]] and [[umeshu]].  [[Image:Woodstill5.jpg|thumb|Single Distillation.

The equipment used for single distillation is called a [[pot still]]. As the shōchū is distilled just once it retains the character of the base ingredient, typically rice, barley or [[potato]], with a strongly individual taste and aroma. Small-to-medium size enterprises make most brands, with the island of Kyūshū famous as the centre of production. Recently however larger corporations have been entering the market.  ====Maturation==== Fresh shōchū is shipped after maturation. Maturation techniques vary in storage vessel and location, both of which affect the character of the shōchū. The most commonly used containers for aging shōchū are stainless steel tanks, clay pots, and wooden barrels or casks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pellegrini|first1=Christopher|title=The Shochu Handbook - An Introduction to Japan's Indigenous Distilled Drink|date=July 22, 2014|publisher=Telemachus Press|isbn=978-1940745282|pages=37–38|url=http://www.amazon.com/The-Shochu-Handbook-Introduction-Indigenous/dp/1940745284/ref=tmm_pap_title_0|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>  As a result of maturation, the flavor and aroma of shōchū settle. Maturation generally takes between one and three months. Maturation from three to six months is called ''beginning maturation''. During this period, sharp flavors in the shōchū generally decrease. Shōchū matured from six months to three years usually has a mellow taste.  A shōchū called ''long-term maturation'' is matured for more than three years. But long-term maturation does not always improve the flavor. On the other hand, long-term maturation is particularly effective for ''awamori''. Distillers often mature ''awamori'' for longer than ten years.  =====Locations===== Shōchū is matured in various places to impart unique flavors, typically where there are minimal variations in temperature and humidity. These places include [[tunnel]]s and [[Cave|limestone caverns]].  ====Honkaku shōchū==== Until 2006 Japanese postwar tax law classified shōchū into "kōrui" and "otsurui" types. The terms {{nihongo|kō|甲}} and {{nihongo|otsu|乙}} are Chinese [[celestial stems]] typically used for classification, and mean something akin to "Grade A" and "Grade B" respectively.  Fearing a tendency to believe that otsurui shōchū is somehow inferior to kōrui shōchū, the Kyūshū Otsurui Shochu Producers' Association lobbied the Finance Ministry, and in 1962 succeeded in having {{nihongo|'''honkaku shōchū'''|本格焼酎|honkaku shōchū}}, or authentic shōchū, recognized as an alternative name. The name is believed to have been coined in 1957 by Enatsu Junkichi, the president of Kirishima Brewery of [[Miyakonojo|Miyakonojō]], [[Miyazaki Prefecture]].<ref name="sakesake">{{cite web|title=Sake Glossary|url=http://www.sakesake.com/comu/word/S_topic1.html|accessdate=2007-01-26}} (Japanese)</ref>  However, since the term was not formally defined naming disputes arose. As a result, on 1 November 2002 the law was clarified and shōchū satisfying any of conditions 1 to 5 of the above definition of singly distilled shōchū can be called honkaku shōchū. Those satisfying the final condition are excluded.  ===Shōchū consumption in Japan by categories=== 2009 Shōchū consumption in Japan by categories (tax base) is as follows;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nta.go.jp/shiraberu/senmonjoho/sake/tokei/kazeikankei2009/pdf/21-01.pdf|publisher=National Tax Agency Japan|title=Alcohol tax (Domestic and Import)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nta.go.jp/shiraberu/senmonjoho/sake/tokei/kazeikankei2009/pdf/21-02.pdf|publisher=National Tax Agency Japan|title=Alcohol tax (Domestic)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nta.go.jp/shiraberu/senmonjoho/sake/tokei/kazeikankei2009/pdf/21-04.pdf|publisher=National Tax Agency Japan|title=Alcohol tax (Import)}}</ref>  {| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" |- ! style="width:2em;" | Category!!

Usually rice or barley is steeped in water, then steamed to promote [[starch gelatinization]] and cooled. # Kōji production. ''kōjikin'', or [[Aspergillus oryzae|koji]] mold spores, are cultivated onto the material to form koji mold which creates enzymes as it grows. The enzymes break starch molecules down into sugar molecules that can be fermented, a process called ''saccharization''. # Primary fermentation. The koji is mashed by adding water and fermented for seven to nine days in a tank or vat to form unrefined alcohol, called '''moto''' or (first stage) '''moromi'''. # Secondary fermentation. The steamed main ingredient and water are added to the unrefined alcohol and fermented again to form (second stage) moromi.

Discovered at the beginning of the [[Taishō period]] when natural mutation and separation of some black kōji to white was observed. This effect was researched and white kōji was successfully grown independently. White kōji is easy to cultivate and its enzymes promote rapid saccharization; as a result it is used to produce most shōchū today. It gives rise to a drink with a refreshing, gentle, sweet taste. * '''Black'''. Mainly used in Okinawa to produce [[#Awamori|Awamori]]. It produces plenty of citric acid which helps to prevent the souring of the moromi. Of all three kōji it most effectively extracts the taste and character of the base ingredients, giving its shōchū a rich aroma with a slightly sweet, mellow taste. Its spores disperse easily, covering production facilities and workers' clothes in a layer of black. Such issues led to it falling out of favour, but due to the development of New Kuro-''kōji'' (NK-''kōji'') in the mid-1980s,<ref name="shochucircle">{{cite web|url= http://www.shochucircle.com| title= Shochu Circle| accessdate= 2007-12-11}}</ref> interest in black kōji resurged amongst honkaku shōchū makers because of the depth and quality of the taste it produced.  Several popular brands now explicitly state they use black kōji on their labels. * '''Yellow'''. Used to produce sake, and at one time all honkaku shōchū. However yellow kōji is extremely sensitive to temperature; its ''moromi'' can easily sour during fermentation. This makes it difficult to use in warmer regions such as Kyūshū, and gradually black and white kōji became more common.  Its strength is that it gives rise to a rich, fruity refreshing taste, so despite the difficulties and great skill required it is still used by some manufacturers. It is popular amongst young people and women who previously had no interest in typically strong potato shōchū, playing a role in its recent revival.  ===Water=== Water is one of the most important ingredients for making shōchū. The quality of water affects that of shōchū directly. Various kinds of water are used in the process of making shōchū.  ===Varieties=== There is a broad variety of moromitori shōchū.  Four locations have achieved protection as [[geographical indication]]s under [[World Trade Organization]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]] article 23 and are noted below.<ref name="aippi"/>  ====Rice shōchū==== {{nihongo|Rice shōchū|米焼酎|komejōchū}} shares its base ingredient with sake.

Originally it was almost exclusively produced in [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]] and [[Miyazaki Prefecture|Miyazaki]] prefectures, but nowadays is made across Japan using locally grown sweet potatoes.  It tends to have has a strong taste and a distinctive smell; more recently producers have made varieties whose aroma is somewhat suppressed.  Kagoshima's {{nihongo|'''[[Satsuma, Kagoshima|Satsuma]] shōchū'''|薩摩焼酎}} has been given protection under WTO rules as a geographical indication.  The 1956 film ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Teahouse of the August Moon]]'' portrayed an American-occupied Okinawan village rebuilding its economy with potato shōchū.  The taste of potato shōchū is a bit smoky, evocative of some whiskeys.  ====Brown sugar shōchū==== [[Image:Bottled amami kokuto shochu.jpg|thumb|Various bottled Amami Kokutō shōchū]] From the Edo Period through to the time of the [[Pacific War]], the [[Amami Islands]] produced drinks such as Awamori and a distilled alcohol based on [[muscovado|brown sugar]]. From the middle of the war through to the American occupation, because of a shortage of rice (the base ingredient of Awamori) and an inability to export the sugar-based alcohol to the mainland, a large surplus was produced. In 1953, when the Amami Islands were returned to Japanese sovereignty, the alcohol was not classified as "shōchū" under the 1949 alcohol tax law and therefore would attract a high rate of tax. The [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Ministry of Finance]], taking into account the desire of local residents and as part of a strategy to promote the region, gave special recognition to the local alcohol as {{nihongo|brown sugar shōchū|黒糖焼酎|kokutō shōchū}}. This recognition was geographically restricted to [[Amami Islands]] of [[Kagoshima Prefecture]] and was conditional on the use of rice kōji. This regional restriction remains in place to this day; as can be seen in the legal definition of singly distilled shōchū above.  Typically brown sugar shōchū contains 30% or 25% [[alcohol by volume]]. Contrary to what might be expected, brown sugar shōchū has a mild and not particularly sweet taste, as it contains no sugar. Nowadays it is produced in 25 breweries in 5 islands, such as [[Kikaijima]], [[Amami Ōshima]], [[Tokunoshima]], [[Okinoerabujima]] and [[Yoronjima]], but Awamori is no longer made outside [[Okinawa Prefecture]].  Before the war another alcoholic drink based on brown sugar was made in the [[Ogasawara Islands]]. Its name translates as "sugar alcohol" and could be seen as a form of brown sugar shōchū. Production ceased because of the war, but recently, aiming to revive its popularity, a similar alcohol, using no rice kōji, has been introduced. However, as Ogasawara does not qualify for the above special regional exemption, this alcohol is instead classified as rum or spirits.  ====Soba shōchū==== [[Soba]], or [[buckwheat]], {{nihongo|shōchū|そば焼酎|sobajōchū}} has origins going back to just 1973 when Unkai Brewery Co., of [[Gokase, Miyazaki]] Prefecture, developed it using soba from the local mountainous region as its base ingredient. Since then shōchū producers across Japan have produced it, sometimes as part of a shōchū blend.  Taste is milder than barley shōchū.  ====Awamori==== {{Main|Awamori}}  [[Image:Kikunotsuyu Awamori.jpg|thumb|A bottle of awamori from the Kikunotsuyu distillery of [[Miyako-jima|Miyako island]], Okinawa]]  [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] is the home of {{nihongo|Awamori|泡盛|awamori}} shōchū, which uses rice as its base ingredient. Prior to April 1983 it was labeled otsurui shōchū, but is now properly called "Authentic Awamori".  Awamori is made from Thai long-grained ''Indica'' crushed rice, not the usual short-grained ''Japonica'' of standard shōchū. The fermentation process employs black koji mold indigenous to Okinawa rather than the standard white variety, and secondary fermentation is not performed.<ref name="chuko-awamori">{{cite web|title=Chuko Distillers Corporation|url=http://www.chuko-awamori.com/english.html|accessdate=2007-01-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070103225000/http://www.chuko-awamori.com/english.html |archivedate = 2007-01-03}}</ref><ref name="Suntory Q&A">{{cite web|title=Suntory Shochu Q&A|url=http://www.suntory.co.jp/customer/FAQ/shochu_type.html|accessdate=2007-01-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101557/http://www.suntory.co.jp/customer/FAQ/shochu_type.html |archivedate = 2006-09-25}}</ref> Fermentation is done in a way that creates plenty of citric acid, allowing it to be produced all year round despite Okinawa's hot climate.<ref name="whatis"/> After distillation its strength is reduced with water to about 25% alcohol by volume, although some varieties go as high as 43%.  Japanese law classifies Awamori as singly distilled honkaku shōchū despite the different production process.  With its method of production Awamori could theoretically be made anywhere in Japan, but '''Ryūkyū Awamori''' is a protected geographical indication restricted to Okinawa.<ref>Okinawa Prefectural Government, "Awamori", Okinawa: Cultural Promotion Division, Okinawa Tourism and Cultural Affairs Bureau, 1996.</ref>  ====Others==== Japanese law admits a very wide range of unusual base ingredients, such as [[perilla]] leaf, [[sesame]] and [[chestnut]],<ref name="ingredients"/> and shōchū made from most if not all of these exists. For example, there is a milk shōchū brand called ''Makiba-no Yume''.<ref>http://www.matsumotoya-sake.com/makiba.html</ref> Others are generic shōchū mixed with a particular fruit juice or extracts.  With its peculiarity, such shōchū is typically intended to catch the eye of visitors to a region and has attracted limited broader appeal. Soba shōchū is a good example of one that has managed to achieve more widespread success.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  ==Kasutori shōchū== In contrast to moromitori shōchū, {{nihongo|'''kasutori shōchū'''|粕取り焼酎}} is made by distilling the sake [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] left over from the fermentation of sake. It is a form of honkaku shōchū.  It first became popular in the north of Kyūshū, and then spread to other areas, being manufactured during a period when it was not possible to brew refined sake across Japan. It is also widely used in sake production to stop fermentation before it is complete, which can help prevent degradation or give a dry taste. Shōchū made for this purpose is called {{nihongo|'''hashira shōchū'''|柱焼酎}}.  During the [[Edo Period]] shōchū lees were used as a fertilizer during the rice-planting season. Many farms therefore installed distillation equipment to distill sake lees to produce shōchū lees. Whilst the lees were used in the fields, the distilled alcohol was drunk, or offered to the gods, at the {{nihongo|sanaburi|早苗響}} festival held at the end of the rice-planting season to pray for a bountiful harvest. Kasutori shōchū has therefore also come to be known as '''sanaburi shōchū'''.<ref name="honkaku yougo"> {{cite web|title=Honkaku Shochu Glossary|url=http://www.japanml.net/japanspirits/dic/03sa.htm|accessdate = 2011-10-05}}</ref><ref name="">{{cite web|title=Drink Kasutori in the Summer, Be Happy|url=http://www.president.co.jp/dan/special/slowfood/008.html|accessdate = 2007-01-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061210084327/http://www.president.co.jp/dan/special/slowfood/008.html |archivedate = 2006-12-10}}</ref>  Owing to the recent surge in popularity of shōchū in Japan, an increasing number of manufacturers have been making kasutori shōchū.  Most kasutori shōchū is made in modern ways, shōchū made via older production processes has decreased sharply. People who wish to preserve Japanese culture call shōchū produced the historical way {{nihongo|'''Seichō kasutori shōchū'''|正調粕取焼酎}}, such drinks have been revitalized by their activities.<ref name="Seichō Kasutori">{{cite web|title=Kasutori Shōchū introduction of Kenji|url=http://beefheart.sakura.ne.jp/tankentai/tanteidan/gairon.html|accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref>  ===Slang usage=== Confusingly kasutori is also a slang term for a separate, inferior form of shōchū. After the [[Pacific War]], in a chaotic society with a shortage of good alcohol, [[moonshine]] shōchū began to circulate. Its source and ingredients were not apparent, and in extreme cases contained toxic [[methyl alcohol]] diluted with water. Such shōchū with ill side-effects became known as ''kasutori'', and the association with poor shōchū lingered, sometimes even affecting the image of "real" respectable kasutori shōchū.  The expressions ''kasutori literature'' and ''kasutori culture'' also came to be associated with the upheavals of the postwar period.  ==Blended shōchū== Singly distilled and multiply distilled shōchū can be mixed to form '''blended shōchū'''. Formerly it was often mislabeled ''honkaku shōchū'', or had no indication of mixing or relative volumes. Starting in 2005 the industry regulated itself and created the {{nihongo|blended shōchū|混和焼酎|konwashōchū}} mark, with subcategorization based upon the relative volumes used.  Singly distilled shōchū makes up 50%–95% of the total volume of ''singly distilled blended shōchū''. This category is targeted at those viewing pure singly distilled shōchū as having too strong a smell or taste, aiming to be softer and more easily drinkable.  In ''multiply distilled blended shōchū'' singly distilled shōchū makes up 5%–50% of the total volume. With a focus on price, this tries to combine the cheap mass-production benefits of multiply distilled shōchū whilst introducing some of the distinctive flavor and aroma of the singly distilled form.  ==See also== {{portal|Liquor|Drink}} *[[Awamori]]—Distilled Okinawan alcoholic drink *[[Rice baijiu]]—Distilled Chinese alcoholic drink *[[Soju]]—Distilled Korean alcoholic drink *[[Rượu đế]]—Distilled Vietnamese alcoholic drink *[[Arrack (drink)|Arrack]]—Distilled spirits in South and South-East Asia *[[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]]—Distilled alcoholic drink produced in the eastern Mediterranean countries *[[Oghi (distilled beverage)]]  ==References== {{Reflist|30em}}  ==External links== * [http://shochu.pro Shochu Pro] * [http://www.honkakushochu-awamori.jp/english/ Honkaku Shochu and Awamori] * [http://www.japanml.net/japanspirits/ 本格焼酎の楽しみ] {{Link language|ja}} * [http://beefheart.sakura.ne.jp/tankentai/tankentai.html 九州焼酎探検隊] {{Link language|ja}}  {{Alcoholic beverages}}  {{Authority control}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Shochu}} [[Category:Japanese distilled beverages]]
