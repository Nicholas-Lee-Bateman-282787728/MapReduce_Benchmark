      Munster (, ) is one of the provinces of Ireland situated in the south of Ireland. In early Ireland, it was one of the "fifths" ruled by a "king of over-kings" . Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, the ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes. In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties. Munster has no official function for local government purposes. For the purposes of the ISO, the province is listed as one of the provincial sub-divisions of the State (ISO 3166-2:IE) and coded as "IE-M". Geographically, Munster covers a total area of  and has a population of 1,246,088 with the most populated city being Cork. Other significant urban centres in the province include Limerick and Waterford.  In the early centuries AD, Munster was the domain of the Iverni and the legendary Clanna Dedad led by Cú Roí and to whom the celebrated Conaire Mór also belonged. In the Fifth Century, St. Patrick spent seven years in the area founding Christian churches and ordaining priests. During the Early Middle Ages, most of the area was part of the Kingdom of Munster, ruled by the Eóganachta dynasty. Prior to this date, the area was ruled by the Dáirine and Corcu Loígde overlords from the early 7th century onwards, perhaps beginning with the notable career of Faílbe Flann mac Áedo Duib. Later rulers from the Eóganachta who would dominate a greater part of Ireland were Cathal mac Finguine and Feidlimid mac Cremthanin. Notable regional kingdoms and lordships of Early Medieval Munster were Iarmuman (West Munster), Osraige (Ossory), Uí Liatháin, Uí Fidgenti, Éile, Múscraige, Ciarraige Luachra, Corcu Duibne, Corcu Baiscinn, and Déisi Muman. By the 9th century the Gaels had been joined by Norse Vikings who founded towns such as Cork, Waterford and Limerick, for the most part incorporated into a maritime empire by the Dynasty of Ivar, who periodically would threaten Munster with conquest in the next century. Around this period Ossory broke away from Munster. The 10th century saw the rise of the Dalcassians (probably descendants of the ancient Mairtine, a sept of the Iverni/Érainn), who had earlier annexed Thomond, north of the Shannon to Munster. Their leaders were the ancestors of the O'Brien dynasty and spawned Brian Bóruma, perhaps the most noted High King of Ireland, and several of whose descendants were also High Kings. By 1118 Munster had fractured into the Kingdom of Thomond under the O'Briens, the Kingdom of Desmond under the MacCarthy dynasty (Eóganachta), and the short-lived Kingdom of Ormond under the O'Kennedys (another Dalcassian sept). The three crowns of the Munster flag represent these three late kingdoms. This flag can easily be confused with the flag of Dublin which has three castles in a similar pattern on a blue background; it also resembles the lesser coat-of-arms of Sweden, the Three Crowns. There was Norman influence from the 14th century, due to adventuring of the FitzGerald, de Clare and Butler houses, two of whom carved out earldoms within the Lordship of Ireland, the Earls of Desmond eventually becoming independent potentates, for a time the greatest in Ireland, while the Earls of Ormond remained closer to England. The O'Brien of Thomond and MacCarthy of Desmond surrendered and regranted sovereignty to the Tudors in 1543 and 1565, joining the Kingdom of Ireland. The terrible Desmond Rebellions, led by the FitzGeralds, soon followed. Almost three centuries later much of the area was hit hard in the Great Hunger, especially the west.In 1841, before the Great Famine, there were just under three million people living in the province, but the population dropped devastatingly low due to mass emigration in the 1840s and continued emigration up until the 1980s. After the kingdom was merged into the United Kingdom, there was a war in the 20th century resulting in secession of the Irish Free State. There was a brief Munster Republic during the Irish Civil War, soon defeated by the Irish Army. The Irish leaders Michael Collins and earlier Daniel O'Connell came from families of the old Gaelic Munster gentry. The area is famed for Irish traditional music. There are many ancient castles and monasteries in the province; this coupled with the vast green countryside and three cities makes it a feature of the tourism industry. During the fifth century, St. Patrick spent seven years founding churches and ordaining priests in Munster, but a fifth century bishop named Ailbe is the patron saint of Munster. In Irish mythology, a number of pagan goddesses are associated with the province including Anann, Áine, Grian, Clíodhna, Aimend, Mór Muman, Bébinn, Aibell and Queen Mongfind. Each is historically associated with certain septs of the nobility. The druid-god of Munster is Mug Ruith. A more shadowy figure is Donn, associated with Tech Duinn, beyond the mortal realm. The province has long had trading and cultural links with continental Europe. The tribe of Corcu Loígde is known to have had a trading fleet active along the French Atlantic coast, as far south as Gascony, importing wine to Munster. The Eóganachta had ecclesiastical ties with distant Germany, which show in the architecture of their ceremonial capital, the famous acropolis on the Rock of Cashel. The majority of Irish ogham inscriptions are found in Munster, principally in areas occupied by the Iverni, especially the Corcu Duibne.The ruins of the Iron Age mountaintop fortress Caherconree, preserving the name of Cú Roí, can also be found in their lands. Later, Europe's first linguistic dictionary in any non-Classical language, the Sanas Cormaic, was compiled by Munster scholars, traditionally thought to have been directed by the king-bishop Cormac mac Cuilennáin (d. 908). The School of Ross in Munster was one of Europe's leading centres of learning in the Early Middle Ages. The province stands divided into six counties and three cities. Munster has many large towns and is the province with the most cites in the Republic of Ireland. Many small satellite towns and villages now have large populations because of cities getting larger. Ballincollig is a good example of this. Not long ago it was a small village in the countryside but because of Cork growing larger it is now one of the largest towns in Munster.     In order of size (2011 census figures; urban areas with over 10,000 inhabitants):  Urban areas 5,000–10,000  Urban areas in bold have city status. Suburbs are areas of cities which used to be towns or villages but joined the cities because of them growing larger. Cork city suburbs Limerick city suburbs Waterford city suburbs Munster is the second wealthiest province(wealthier than Ulster and Connacht) on the island of Ireland and also benefits from high salary levels. According to the 2012 Eurostat figures, GDP per capita ranges from €25,600 in the South Tipperary/Waterford (South-East)region to €48,500 in Cork and Kerry(South-West).County Dublin#cite note-7 The province contributes 50bn euro to Irish GDP (25% of total Irish GDP) (2012) (greater than the Economy of Northern Ireland 43 bn euro). Munster also is wealthier than Slovenia (pop. 2m), Lithuania (pop. 3.5m), Latvia (pop. 2.5m) and Kenya (pop. 35m). Munster is the home to many modern capital intensive, highly productive private sector enterprises. The Economy of Cork and Economy of Limerick are the main engines of the province's economy. The Cork harbour area was the centre of Ireland's heavy industry manufacturing sector. Cork had a steel mill, a shipyard, a car assembly plant, a tyre plant, a deep harbour, and a thriving textile sector in the mid twentieth century. However heavy taxes, excessive regulation, competition from larger centres of economic activity, and the sudden removal of protective tariffs upon membership of the European Economic Community caused a decline in the 1970s. Cork was Ireland's rust belt city in the 1980s, as heavy industry moved out, and newer sectors tried to get established in as unemployment peaked. The Kerry group is one of Ireland's companies. The largest retail groups are Dunnes Stores, and the Musgrave Group. Cork is also home to two of the three Irish stout brands; Murphy's Irish stout, and Beamish, as well as the 'Paddy' brand of Irish whiskey as well as the cider brand Bulmers. The Crescent Shopping Centre is Munster's largest shopping centre located in Dooradoyle in Limerick City with over 110 shops in an estimated 100,000 square metres of retail space. Mahon Point Shopping Centre located in Cork City has an estimated total retail floor area of 23,225 square metres and has 60 shops. Shannon Airport, a rich music tradition, the best food from land and sea, and landscapes of international renown, have all been influential in the development of the tourist sector in Munster.  The majority of the Republic's power stations are located in Munster. Ireland's only oil refinery and oil storage facility is still located at Whitegate. The majority of Ireland's gas production comes from Kinsale Head in County Cork, from where it is transported by pipeline across the country. Moneypoint power station located near Kilrush in County Clare is Ireland's largest electricity generating station. It is Ireland's only coal powered station and is Ireland's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is capable of meeting around 25% of customer demand across the country. The hydroelectric power plant at Ardnacrusha to the north of Limerick City in County Clare is Ireland's largest river hydroelectric power station and is operated on a purpose built canal from the River Shannon. It was the largest infrastructural project undertaken by newly established Irish Free State and was completed in 1927. For a time it was the largest hydroelectric power station in the world but was overtaken by the Hoover Dam. Limerick Alumina and Lisheen mine are located in the province. Ireland has 225 wind farms with a total installed capacity of 3025 MW (Megawatts). Munster is home to the majority of Ireland's wind farms.http://www.iwea.com/faqs Munster is one of Ireland's most important I.T. hubs with such multinationals as Apple, Intel, Amazon and Dell locating in the province. The Atlantic Quarter in Cork is a new plan to create a smaller version of Dublin's IFSC in Cork docklands. In Kerry, FEXCO Financial Services in Killorglin is a foreign exchange and global payments group. Munster has developed into the centre of Ireland's pharmaceutical industry. The province plays an ever greater role in the bio-pharmaceutical industry and is successful in fighting off stiff competition from Switzerland and Singapore for inward investments in the bio-pharmaceutical area in companies such as Amgen and Pfizer and Roche (located in Clarecastle Co.Clare). Large employers in the region include AOL, Bausch & Lomb, Dairygold, Dell, Amazon, Motorola, Amgen, Pfizer, Analog Devices, Fexco Financial Services, Vistakon, Waterford Crystal, Apple Computer, Intel, Novartis, O2, Lufthansa Technik, Kerry Group, Siemens, Sony and Blizzard Entertainment. The largest employment hub in Munster is Metropolitan Cork, with many large multinational firms located in the area. http://www.top1000.ie/companies Cork Harbour is the largest natural harbour in Europe and has always had a long and important maritime history. Haulbowline Island is the location of the Irish naval fleet. The National Maritime College of Ireland is at Ringaskiddy on the western side of the harbour. The town of Cobh and the village of Dunmore East are the only cruise ship destination. Cobh is also where the Titanic made its last port of call before meeting its final destiny. Shannon Foynes Port is located in north County Limerick on the Shannon Estuary on a deep water estuary. Foynes Harbour is located  from the mouth of the River Shannon. The very busy commercial shipping town provides an excellent anchorage plus moorings and a club pontoon that accommodate visitors. New plans are underway for further development of the port,url= http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/business/business-news/plan-for-foynes-port-to-capitalise-on-new-era-of-global-supertankers-1-4839274 Foynes provides complete protection from all winds and may easily be described as the most sheltered location upon the Shannon Estuary. It offers safe access as it is well lit and all dangers are well marked. Although subject to the challenges of the Shannon currents, it can be approached at all points of the tide, night or day. The harbour may be entered either from west through the preferred main deep water channel or from northeast by a buoyed channel. url = http://www.inyourfootsteps.com/sailing/harbours/95/foynes_harbour  Limerick Port is now control under Shannon Foynes Port Company which is Ireland second largest port authority (2007).url = http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/docks%20117.pdf url=http://www.limerickcity.ie/Library/LocalStudies/LocalStudiesFiles/D/Docks/ url = http://limerickslife.com/limerick-docks/ Waterford Harbour is a natural harbour at the mouth of the Three Sisters; the River Nore, the River Suir and the River Barrow in Ireland. It is navigable for shipping to both Waterford and New Ross. The Port of Waterford is capable of accommodating vessels up to 32,000 tons dwt. It separates County Waterford from County Wexford on the eastern side of the estuary. Munster is linked to the rest of Ireland via several connections on Ireland's motorway network, most which have been constructed in the past decade. Main interurban routes include the M8 from Cork City which runs through North Co. Cork & Tipperary. The M7 which runs east from Limerick City – acting as a bypass for the city – through north Co. Tipperary & converges with the M8 in Co. Laois to form the primary interurban route to Dublin from the province. Also, the M9 motorway connects Waterford City to Dublin. It merges with the M7 motorway at Newbridge. Other major regional routes include the M18 Which runs north from Limerick City through Co. Clare, the N25 which runs east from Cork City through east Co. Cork to Waterford City and onto Rosslare Europort, the N20 which connects Cork City with Limerick City, the N21 & N22 which links Co. Kerry with Limerick City & Cork City respectively. The N24 connects Limerick City to Waterford City. The N71 runs south west from Cork City through West Cork & Co. Kerry. The N72 runs from North Co. Kerry, through North Cork and into Co. Waterford. The busiest road in the province is the N40 which acts as a southern bypass and artery for the Cork City metropolitan area. This road, previously signposted the N25 until re-designation in 2012, has been extensively upgraded in the past decade with the removal of the Kinsale Road Roundabout & the ongoing removal of the Bandon Road & Sarsfield Road roundabouts. The N40 links with the N25 via the Jack Lynch Tunnel, which is frequently congested due to the under-powered design of the Dunkettle Interchange In Limerick, the Shannon tunnel (which runs west of the city), links the M7/M20 motorways with the N18/M18 motorway. Waterford City is also bypassed by way of the N25 dual carriageway.  This bypass connects to the N24 and M9 motorway. Railway services in MunsterIreland Map.
