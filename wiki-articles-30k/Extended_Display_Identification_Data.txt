 Extended display identification data (EDID) is a data structure provided by a digital display to describe its capabilities to a video source (e.g. graphics card or set-top box).  It is what enables a modern personal computer to know what kinds of monitors are connected to it.  EDID is defined by a standard published by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA).  The EDID includes manufacturer name and serial number, product type, phosphor or filter type, timings supported by the display, display size, luminance data and (for digital displays only) pixel mapping data. EDID structure versions range from v1.0 to v1.4; all these define upwards-compatible 128-byte structures. EDID structure v2.0 defined a new 256-byte structure, but subsequently has been deprecated and replaced by v1.3. HDMI 1.0 – 1.3c uses EDID structure v1.3.HDMI Specification v1.3a DisplayID is a standard targeted to replace EDID and E-EDID extensions with a uniform format suited for both PC monitor and consumer electronics devices. The channel for transmitting the EDID from the display to the graphics card is usually the I²C-bus, defined in DDC2B (DDC1 used a different serial format which never gained popularity). Before DDC and EDID were defined, there was no standard way for a graphics card to know what kind of display device it was connected to. Some VGA connectors in personal computers provided a basic form of identification by connecting one, two or three pins to ground, but this coding was not standardized. The EDID is often stored in the monitor in a memory device called a serial PROM (programmable read-only memory) or EEPROM (electrically erasable PROM) and is accessible via the I²C-bus at address 0x50.DDC/CI specifications The EDID PROM can often be read by the host PC even if the display itself is turned off. Many software packages can read and display the EDID information, such as read-edidread-edid software for Linux and DOS for Linux and DOS, PowerStripPowerStrip for Windows (Shareware) for Microsoft Windows and XFree86 for Linux and BSD unix. Mac OS X natively reads EDID information and programs such as SwitchResXSwitchResX for Mac OS X shows EDID and customizes display timings or DisplayConfigXDisplayConfigX for Mac OS X customizes display timings can display the information as well as use it to define custom resolutions. Enhanced EDID was introduced at the same time as E-DDC; it introduced EDID structure version 1.3 which supports multiple extensions blocks and deprecated EDID version 2.0 structure (although it can be supported as an extension). Data fields for preferred timing, range limits, monitor name are required in E-EDID.  E-EDID also supports dual GTF timings and aspect ratio change. With the use of extensions, E-EDID string can be lengthened up to 32 KBytes. Some graphics card drivers have historically coped poorly with the EDID, using only its standard timing descriptors rather than its Detailed Timing Descriptors (DTDs).  Even in cases where the DTDs were read, the drivers are/were still often limited by the standard timing descriptor limitation that the horizontal/vertical resolutions must be evenly divisible by 8.  This means that many graphics cards cannot express the native resolutions of the most common wide screen flat panel displays  and liquid crystal display televisions.  The number of vertical pixels is calculated from the horizontal resolution and the selected aspect ratio. To be fully expressible, the size of wide screen display must thus be a multiple of  16×9 pixels. For 1366×768 pixel Wide XGA panels the nearest resolution expressible in the EDID standard timing descriptor syntax is 1360×765 pixels, typically leading to 3 pixel thin black bars. Specifying 1368 pixels as the screen width would yield an unnatural screen height of 769.5 pixels. Many Wide XGA panels do not advertise their native resolution in the standard timing descriptors, instead offering only a resolution of 1280×768. Some panels advertise a resolution only slightly smaller than the native, such as 1360×765. For these panels to be able to show a pixel perfect image, the EDID data must be ignored by the display driver or the driver must correctly interpret the DTD and be able to resolve resolutions whose size is not divisible by 8. Special programs are available to override the standard timing descriptors from EDID data. Even this is not always possible however, as some vendors' graphics drivers (notably those of Intel) require specific registry hacks to implement custom resolutions, which can make it very difficult to use the screen's native resolution. When used for another descriptor, the pixel clock and some other bytes are set to 0: Currently defined descriptor types are:    The CEA EDID Timing Extension was first introduced in EIA/CEA-861, and has since been updated several times, most notably with the −861B revision (which was version 3 of the extension, adding Short Video Descriptors and advanced audio capability/configuration information), −861D (published in July 2006 and containing updates to the audio segments), −861E, and −861F which was published on June 4, 2013.http://www.ce.org/Standards/Standard-Listings/R4-8-DTV-Interface-Subcommittee/CEA-861-E.aspx  According to Brian Markwalter, senior vice president, research and standards, CEA, −861F "includes a number of noteworthy enhancements, including support for several new Ultra HD and widescreen video formats and additional colorimetry schemes.”http://www.scrapmonster.com/news/cea-publishes-new-high-speed-cea-861-f-dtv-interface-standard/1/9294 Version 1 (as defined in −861) allowed the specification of video timings only through the use of 18-byte Detailed Timing Descriptors (as detailed in EDID 1.3 data format above).  In all cases, the "preferred" timing should be the first DTD listed in a CEA EDID Timing Extension. Version 2 (as defined in −861A) added the capability to designate a number of DTDs as "native" and also included some "basic discovery" functionality for whether the display device contains support for "basic audio", YCbCr pixel formats, and underscan. Per Version 3 (from the −861B spec), there are two different ways to specify the timings of available DTV formats: via the use of 18-byte Detailed Timing Descriptors as in Version 1 & 2, and via the use of the Short Video Descriptor (see below). HDMI 1.0 -1.3c uses this version. Included in Version 3 are four new optional types of data blocks: Video Data Blocks (containing the aforementioned Short Video Descriptors), Audio Data Blocks (containing Short Audio Descriptors), Speaker Allocation Data Blocks (containing information about the speaker configuration of the display device), and Vendor Specific Data Blocks (which can contain information specific to a given vendor's use).  Byte sequence 00: Extension tag (which kind of extension block this is); 02h for CEA EDID 01: Revision number (Version number); 03h for Version 3 02: Byte number "d" within this block where the 18-byte DTDs begin. If no non-DTD data is present      in this extension block, the value should be set to 04h (the byte after next). If set to 00h,     there are no DTDs present in this block and no non-DTD data. 03: Number of Native DTDs present, other Version 2+ information      bit 7: 1 if display supports underscan, 0 if not      bit 6: 1 if display supports basic audio, 0 if not      bit 5: 1 if display supports YCbCr 4:4:4, 0 if not      bit 4: 1 if display supports YCbCr 4:2:2, 0 if not      bit 3..0: total number of native formats in the DTDs included in this block 04: Start of Data Block Collection.  If byte 02 is set to 04h, this is where the DTD collection     begins.  If byte 02 is set to another value, byte 04 is where the Data Block Collection begins,     and the DTD collection follows immediately thereafter.  The Data Block Collection contains one or more data blocks detailing video, audio, and speaker placement information about the display. The blocks can be placed in any order, and the initial byte of each block defines both its type and its length:      bit 7..5: Block Type Tag (1 is audio, 2 is video, 3 is vendor specific, 4 is speaker                allocation, all other values Reserved)       bit 4..0: Total number of bytes in this block following this byte Once one data block has ended, the next byte is assumed to be the beginning of the next data block. This is the case until the byte (designated in Byte 02, above) where the DTDs are known  to begin.      Any Audio Data Block contains one or more 3-byte Short Audio Descriptors (SADs).  Each SAD     details audio format, channel number, and bitrate/resolution capabilities of the display as     follows:     SAD Byte 1 (format and number of channels):        bit 7: Reserved (0)        bit 6..3: Audio format code          1 = Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM)          2 = AC-3          3 = MPEG1 (Layers 1 and 2)          4 = MP3          5 = MPEG2          6 = AAC          7 = DTS          8 = ATRAC          0, 15: Reserved           9 = One-bit audio aka SACD         10 = DD+         11 = DTS-HD         12 = MLP/Dolby TrueHD         13 = DST Audio         14 = Microsoft WMA Pro        bit 2..0: number of channels minus 1  (i.e. 000 = 1 channel; 001 = 2 channels; 111 =                  8 channels)      SAD Byte 2 (sampling frequencies supported):        bit 7: Reserved (0)        bit 6: 192kHz        bit 5: 176kHz        bit 4: 96kHz        bit 3: 88kHz        bit 2: 48kHz        bit 1: 44kHz        bit 0: 32kHz      SAD Byte 3 (bitrate):       For LPCM, bits 7:3 are reserved and the remaining bits define bit depth        bit 2: 24 bit        bit 1: 20 bit        bit 0: 16 bit     For all other sound formats, bits 7..0 designate the maximum supported bitrate divided by      8 kbit/s.      Any Video Data Block will contain one or more 1-byte Short Video Descriptors (SVDs).  They are      decoded as follows:        bit 7: 1 to designate that this should be considered a "native" resolution, 0 for non-native        bit 6..0: index value to a table of standard

vertical  total lines which are 1125 and 1250, respectively.  Notes: Parentheses indicate instances where pixels are repeated to meet the minimum speed requirements of the interface. For example, in the 720X240p case, the pixels on each line are double-clocked. In the (2880)X480i case, the number of pixels on each line, and thus the number of times that they are repeated, is variable, and is sent to the DTV monitor by the source device.  Increased Hactive expressions include “2x” and “4x” indicate two and four times the reference  resolution, respectively.  The CEA/EIA-861/A standard included only numbers 1-7 and numbers 17-22 above(but not as short video descriptors which were introduced in CEA/EIA-861B) and are considered primary video format timings. The CEA/EIA-861B standard included the first 34 short video descriptors above. The CEA/EIA-861D standard included the first 59 short video descriptors above. The CEA/EIA-861E standard included the first 64 short video descriptors above. HDMI 1.0 to HDMI 1.2a uses the CEA-861-B video standard, HDMI 1.3 to HDMI 1.3c uses the CEA-861-D video standard, HDMI 1.4 uses the CEA/EIA-861E video standard. HDMI 2.0 uses the CEA/EIA-861F standard.  A Vendor Specific Data Block (if any) contains as its first three bytes the vendor's IEEE  24-bit registration number, LSB first. For HDMI, it is always 00-0C-03 for HDMI Licensing, LLC. It is followed by a two byte source physical address, LSB first. The source physical address provides the CEC physical address for upstream CEC devices.  The remainder of the Vendor Specific Data Block is the "data payload",which can be anything the vendor considers worthy of inclusion in this EDID extension block. HDMI 1.3a specifies some requirements for the data payload.  See that spec for detailed info on these bytes:     VSD Byte 1-3 IEEE Registration Identifier (LSB First)     VSD Byte 4-5 Components of Source Physical Address (See section 8.7 of HDMI 1.3a)     VSD Byte 6 (optional) (bits are set if sink supports...):          bit 7: Supports_AI (...a function that needs info from ACP or ISRC packets)          bit 6: DC_48bit (...16-bit-per-channel deep color)          bit 5: DC_36bit (...12-bit-per-channel deep color)          bit 4: DC_30bit (...10-bit-per-channel deep color)          bit 3: DC_Y444  (...4:4:4 in deep color modes)          bit 2: Reserved (0)          bit 1: Reserved (0)          bit 0: DVI_Dual (...DVI Dual Link Operation)     VSD Byte 7 (optional) If non-zero (Max_TMDS_Frequency / 5mhz)     VSD Byte 8 (optional) (latency fields indicators):          bit 7: latency_fields (set if latency fields are present)          bit 6: i_latency_fields (set if interlaced latency fields are present; if set                 four latency fields will be present, 0 if bit 7 is 0)          bits 5-0: Reserved (0)     VSD Byte  9 (optional) Video Latency (if indicated, value=1+ms/2 with a max of 251 meaning 500ms)     VSD Byte 10 (optional) Audio Latency (video delay for progressive sources, same units as above)     VSD Byte 11 (optional) Interlaced Video Latency (if indicated, same units as above)     VSD Byte 12 (optional) Interlaced Audio Latency (video delay for interlaced sources, same units as above) Additional bytes may be present, but the HDMI spec says they shall be zero.  If a Speaker Allocation Data Block is present, it will consist of three bytes.  The second and  third are Reserved (all 0), but the first contains information about which speakers are present in  the display device:          bit 7: Reserved (0)          bit 6: Rear Left Center / Rear Right Center present for 1, absent for 0          bit 5: Front Left Center / Front Right Center present for 1, absent for 0          bit 4: Rear Center present for 1, absent for 0          bit 3: Rear Left / Rear Right present for 1, absent for 0          bit 2: Front Center present for 1, absent for 0          bit 1: LFE present for 1, absent for 0          bit 0: Front Left / Front Right present for 1, absent for 0      Note that for speakers with right and left polarity, it is assumed that both      left and right are present.  "d": byte (designated in byte 02) where DTDs begin.  18-byte DTD strings continue for an unspecified  length (modulo 18) until a "00 00" is as the first bytes of a prospective DTD.  At this point, the DTDs are known to be complete, and the start address of the "00 00" can be considered to be "XX" (see below)  "XX"-126: Post-DTD padding.
