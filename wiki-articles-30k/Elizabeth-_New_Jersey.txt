The city of Elizabeth has several distinct districts and neighborhoods.   Midtown also occasionally known as Uptown, is the main commercial district and a historic section as well. It includes the First Presbyterian Church and St. John's Episcopal Church, and its St. John's Episcopal Churchyard. The First Presbyterian Church was a battleground for the American Revolution. Located here are also the 1931 Art Deco Hersh Tower,Goodnough, Abby. "NEW JERSEY & CO.; In Elizabeth, Dusting Off an Art Deco Treasure", The New York Times, August 6, 1995.

Midtown/Uptown includes the area once known as "Brittanville" which contained many English type gardens. Bayway is located in the southern part of the City and borders the City of Linden. From US 1&9 and Allen Street, between the Elizabeth River and the Arthur Kill, it has maintained a strong Polish community for years.  Developed at the turn of the 20th century, many of the area residents once worked  at the refinery which straddles both Elizabeth and Linden.  There are unique ethnic restaurants, bars, and stores along Bayway Avenue, and a variety of houses of worship. Housing styles are older and well maintained. There are many affordable two to four-family housing units, and multiple apartment complexes. The western terminus of the Goethals Bridge, which spans the Arthur Kill to Staten Island can be found here.  A small section of the neighborhood was isolated with both the completion of the Goethals Bridge in 1928 and the construction of the New Jersey Turnpike in the 1950s.  This section known as "Relocated Bayway" will soon be a memory and piece of history as many of the residents have been relocated themselves to make way for the expansion of the Goethals Bridge. Downtown / E-Port (a.k.a. The Port and Elizabethport) is the oldest neighborhood in Elizabeth and perhaps the most diverse place in the City.  It is a collection of old world Elizabeth, new America, and a mix of colonial-style houses and apartment buildings that stretch east of 7th Street to its shores.  The name derived from its dependency of businesses catering to sea going ventures.  It was a thriving center of business between approximately the 1660s through the middle of the 20th Century.  This area has had a great deal of improvement in the last fifteen years. Many homes have been refurbished or replaced with new, more ornate constructions. Housing projects that stood for years along First Street were demolished and replaced with attractive apartment complexes for those with low to moderate incomes. New townhomes on the waterfront have been developed, and new two-family homes are currently under construction.  The area formally had three subdividing neighborhoods called Buckeye, New Mexico and Diamondville. It is the former home of the Singer Manufacturing Company, makers of Singer sewing machines. The Elizabeth Marina, which in the past was filled with trash and debris along its walkway, was also beautified and many celebrations are held year round, from a Hispanic festival in the late spring to the lighting of a Christmas tree in the winter. Living conditions in this area continue to improve year after year. Historically, there was a Slavic community here, centered by a church (Sts. Peter and Paul Byzantine) and a Lithuanian (Sts. Peter and Paul, R.C.) and Polish (St. Adalbert) Roman Catholic Church still stands in the neighborhood.  St. Patrick Church, originally Irish, dominates the 'Port and was built in 1888.  Elmora is a middle/working-class neighborhood in the western part of Elizabeth. The main thoroughfare, Elmora Avenue, boasts some of the best restaurants, shops and boutiques. A few of the City’s most luxurious high-rise building complexes- affording views of the New York skyline - dot the edge of this neighborhood and are convenient to the Midtown NJ Transit Train Station.  The neighborhood area forms a "V" from its approximate borders of the Central RR tracks to Rahway Av. The northwestern part of Elmora is known as Elmora Hills. It is a strongly middle- to upper-middle-class neighborhood. Originally called Shearerville, the name Elmora came from the developers of the area, the El Mora Land Company.  This area was annexed from Union, returning to Elizabeth in the early part of the 20th Century.  This was done to increase the city's tax base as major improvements to infrastructure were necessary at the time. Frog Hollow is a small community of homes east of Atlantic Street, west of the Arthur Kill, and south of Elizabeth Avenue.  Its name is derived from the excellent frog catching in its marshes as well as the excellent oyster and fishing of the past.  The area expanded east and includes the area formally known as Helltown.  Helltown included many of the docs, shipyards as well as several drydocks.  The area developer was Edward N Kellogg who also laid out the neighborhood in Keighry Head. Frog Hollow contains older style, affordable homes, rentals and some quality restaurants in a working-class community. The statue honoring former Mayor Mack on Elizabeth Avenue is a landmark in the community. Frog Hollow is also convenient to the Veteran’s Memorial Waterfront Park. The name is attributed to James Keighry of the Isle of Kerry, Ireland.  He was a notable resident who owned a business facing the square formed at the junction of Jackson, Madison, Chestnut and Magnolia Avenues.  The approximate borders of this neighborhood extended north from East Grand Street to Flora Street and from Walnut to Division Street.  Developed by Edward N. Kellogg, many of the streets were named after family and friends.  Keighry Head is located close to Midtown, containing affordable one and two-family homes, and apartment houses, convenient to the Midtown shopping district, and transportation.   The North End also known as "North Elizabeth" is mainly a diverse working-class neighborhood.  The borders are approximately the Arch north to the city line between North Broad Street and US 1&9.  Developed mostly in the 1920s for workers in the Dusenburg automobile plant (later Durant Auto, Burry Biscuits and Interbake Foods).  Initially not having an ethnic composition, the area was heavily settled by the Irish and then Portuguese.  The North End has easy access to New York and Newark via its own NJ Transit train station, Routes 1&9 and the NJ Turnpike. The neighborhood also has Crane Square, the Historic Nugents Tavern, and Kellogg Park and its proximity to Newark Airport.  There is currently a plan in place to develop the former Interbake Foods facility into shopping and residential town houses and condominiums. This community contains many larger one and two-family homes that have been rebuilt over the past decade. North Elizabeth also features many well-kept apartment houses and condominium units on and around North Avenue that are home to professionals who work in New York or the area. The only Benedictine women's community in New Jersey is located at Saint Walburga Monastery on North Broad Street. Peterstown (also known as "The Burg") is a middle/working-class neighborhood in the southeastern part of the city. Its borders run west of Atlantic St. to South Spring Street from 1st Avenue to the Elizabeth River.  The name is derived from John Peters who owned most of the land with George Peters.  They divided the land and developed in during the end of the 19th Century.  The area of Peterstown was once predominantly occupied its earliest settlers who were German and during the 1920s was gentrified by newly immigrated Italians. Peterstown has clean, quiet streets and has many affordable housing opportunities with a “village” feel. The area contains the historic Union Square, home to produce stands, meat markets, fresh fish and poultry stores. Peterstown is also home to the DeCavalcante crime family, one of the most infamous Mafia families in the United States. The Point formally known as the Crossroads is centrally located and defined by New Point Road and Division Street. It is located close to Midtown and contains many new affordable two-family homes, apartment houses and is undergoing a transformation.  The former Elizabeth General Hospital site is currently being demolished and awaiting a new development. Home to St. Mary's and the "Hilltoppers" this area once was lined with mansions.  The approximate borders were South Broad Street to Grier Avenue and Pearl Street to what is now US 1&9.  During its development in the 1860s it was the most fashionable area of the city to live.  It is now a quiet middle class community experiencing a re-development with many new condominiums. Developed by Edward J. Grassman, Westminster got its name from the City’s largest residential estates, of the Tudor style and was inhabited by many residents who traced their ancestry to England.  This neighborhood borders Hillside with the Elizabeth River running its border creating a dramatic splash of greenery and rolling hills off of North Avenue, near Liberty Hall. Residents use this area for recreation, whether it is at the newly christened Phil Rizzuto Park area, or for bird watching or for sunbathing by the river. It is one of the more affluent areas of Elizabeth. The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and cold winters.
