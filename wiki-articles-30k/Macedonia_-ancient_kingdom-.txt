    Macedonia or Macedon (; , ; ) was an ancient kingdom on the northern periphery of Classical GreeceSimon Hornblower, "Greek Identity in the Archaic and Classical Periods" in Katerina Zacharia, Hellenisms, Ashgate Publishing, 2008, pp. 55–58. and later the dominant state of Hellenistic Greece.M. M. Austin, "The Hellenistic World from Alexander to the Roman Conquest: a selection of ancient sources in translation", Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 3,  . It was ruled during most of its existence initially by the founding dynasty of the Argeads, the intermittent Antipatrids and finally the Antigonids. Home to the Macedonians, the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula, bordered by Epirus to the west, Paeonia to the north, the region of Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south. Prior to the fourth century BC, Macedonia was a small kingdom in northern Greece, outside the area dominated by the great city-states of Athens, Sparta and Thebes, and at one time was subordinate to Achaemenid Persia. The reign of Philip II (359–336 BC) saw the rise of Macedonia, when the kingdom rose to control the entire Greek world. With the innovative Macedonian army, Philip defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the decisive Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC and subdued them, while keeping Sparta in check. His son Alexander the Great pursued his father's effort to command the whole of Greece through the federation of Greek states, a feat he finally accomplished after destroying a revolting Thebes. Alexander then led this force in a large campaign against the Achaemenid Empire, in retaliation for the invasion of Greece in the 5th century BC. In the ensuing wars of Alexander the Great, Alexander overthrew the Achaemenid Empire, conquering a territory that came to stretch as far as the Indus River. For a brief period his Macedonian Empire was the most powerful in the world, the definitive Hellenistic state, inaugurating the transition to this new period of Ancient Greek civilization. Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advancements in philosophy and science were spread to the ancient world. Of particular importance were the contributions of Aristotle, a teacher to Alexander, whose teachings carried on many centuries past his death. Following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, the ensuing wars of the Diadochi and the partitioning of his short-lived empire, Macedonia proper carried on as a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, and the Attalid kingdom. Important cities like Pella, Pydna, and Amphipolis were involved in power struggles for control of the territory, and new cities were founded, like Thessalonica by the usurper Cassander, which is now the second largest city of modern-day Greece. Macedonia's decline began with the rise of Rome until its ultimate subjection in 168 BC following the Macedonian Wars .  The name Macedonia (, ) comes from the Greek Μακεδόνες (Makedónes), deriving ultimately from the ancient Greek adjective μακεδνός (makednós), meaning "tall, taper", possibly descriptive of the people.μακεδνός, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus It also shares the same root as the noun μάκρος (mákros), meaning "length" in both ancient and modern Greek.μάκρος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus The name is originally believed to have meant either "highlanders" or "the tall ones",Macedonia, Online Etymology DictionaryEugene N. Borza, Makedonika, Regina Books, ISBN 0-941690-65-2, p.114: The "highlanders" or "Makedones" of the mountainous regions of western Macedonia are derived from northwest Greek stock; they were akin both to those who at an earlier time may have migrated south to become the historical "Dorians".Nigel Guy Wilson, Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece, Routledge, 2009, p.439: The latest archaeological findings have confirmed that Macedonia took its name from a tribe of tall, Greek-speaking people, the Makednoi. However, according to modern research by Robert S. P. Beekes, both terms are of Pre-Greek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of Indo-European morphology. The shorter English name variant Macedon developed in Middle English, based on a borrowing from the French form of the name, Macédoine.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. 'Macedon'  The lands around Aegae, the first Macedonian capital, were home to various peoples. Macedonia was called Emathia (from king Emathion) and the city of Aiges was called Edessa, the capital of fabled king Midas in his youth. In approximately 650 BC, the Argeads, an ancient Greek royal house led by Perdiccas I  established their palace-capital at Aegae.. It seems that the first Macedonian state emerged in the 8th or early 7th century BC under the Argead Dynasty, who, according to legend, migrated to the region from the Greek city of Argos in Peloponnesus (thus the name Argead). Herodotus mentions this founding myth when Alexander I was asked to prove his Greek descent in order to participate in the Olympic Games, an athletic event in which only men of Greek origin were entitled to participate. Alexander proved his (Argead) descent and was allowed to compete by the Hellanodikai: “And that these descendants of Perdiccas are Greeks, as they themselves say, I happen to know myself, and not only so, but I will prove in the succeeding history that they are Greeks. Moreover the Hellanodicai, who manage the games at Olympia, decided that they were so: for when Alexander wished to contend in the games and had descended for this purpose into the arena, the Greeks who were to run against him tried to exclude him, saying that the contest was not for Barbarians to contend in but for Greeks: since however Alexander proved that he was of Argos, he was judged to be a Greek, and when he entered the contest of the foot-race his lot came out with that of the first."Herodotus, Histories, Book 5: Terpsichore 22. The Macedonian tribe ruled by the Argeads, was itself called Argead (which translates as "descended from Argos"). Other founding myths served other agenda: according to Justin's, Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus, Caranus, accompanied by a multitude of Greeks came to the area in search for a new homeland Justin. Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus, 7.1. took Edessa and renamed it Aegae. Subsequently, he expelled Midas and other kings and formed his new kingdom. Conversely, according to Herodotus, it was Dorus, the son of Hellen who led his people to Histaeotis, whence they were driven off by the Cadmeians into Pindus, where they settled as Macedonians. Later, a branch would migrate further south to be called Dorians.Herodotus. Histories, 1.56.3. The kingdom was situated in the fertile alluvial plain, watered by the rivers Haliacmon and Axius, called Lower Macedonia, north of the mountain Olympus. Around the time of Alexander I of Macedon, the Argead Macedonians started to expand into Upper Macedonia, lands inhabited by independent Macedonian tribes like the Lyncestae and the Elmiotae and to the West, beyond Axius river, into Eordaia, Bottiaea, Mygdonia, Crestonia and Almopia, regions settled by, among others, many Thracian tribes.. To the north of Macedonia lay various non-Greek peoples such as the Paeonians due north, the Thracians to the northeast, and the Illyrians, with whom the Macedonians were frequently in conflict, to the northwest. To the south lay Thessaly, with whose inhabitants the Macedonians had much in common both culturally and politically, while to west lay Epirus, with whom the Macedonians had a peaceful relationship and in the 4th century BC formed an alliance against Illyrian raids.. Near the modern city of Veria, Perdiccas I (or, more likely, his son, Argaeus I) built his capital, Aigai (modern Vergina). In 512/511 BC, Macedon became a vassal state of Achaemenid Persia during the rule of Darius Hystaspes. Following the Ionian Revolt, Persian rule over the Balkans loosened, including over Macedon. After having successfully suppressed the revolt, Mardonius re-subjugated Thrace and conquered Macedon, making it a fully subordinate part of Persia in 492 BC during the reign of king Alexander I (495&ndash;450 BC). The state eventually regained its independence during the same long reign of King Alexander I as well, following the Greco-Persian Wars. In the Peloponnesian War Macedon was a secondary power that alternated in support between Sparta and Athens. Prior to the 4th century BC, the kingdom covered a region approximately corresponding to the Western and Central parts of the province of Macedonia in modern Greece. A unified Macedonian state was eventually established by King Amyntas III (c. 393&ndash;370 BC), though it still retained strong contrasts between the cattle-rich coastal plain and the fierce isolated tribal hinterland, allied to the king by marriage ties. They controlled the passes through which barbarian invasions came from Illyria to the north and northwest. It became increasingly Atticised during this period, though prominent Athenians appear to have regarded the Macedonians as uncouth. Before the establishment of the League of Corinth, even though the Macedonians apparently spoke a dialect of the Greek language and claimed proudly that they were Greeks, they were not considered to fully share the classical Greek culture by many of the inhabitants of the southern city states, because they did not share the polis-based style of government. Herodotus, one of the foremost biographers in antiquity who lived in Greece at the time when the Macedonian king Alexander I was in power, recorded:  "And that these descendants of Perdiccas are Hellenes, as they themselves say, I happen to know myself, and not only so, but I will prove in the succeeding history that they are Hellenes. Moreover the Hellanodikai, who manage the games at Olympia, decided that they were so: for when Alexander wished to contend in the games and had descended for this purpose into the arena, the Hellenes who were to run against him tried to exclude him, saying that the contest was not for Barbarians to contend in but for Hellenes: since however Alexander proved that he was of Argos, he was judged to be a Hellene, and when he entered the contest of the foot-race his lot came out with that of the first." Herodotus. Histories, 5.22.  Over the 4th century Macedon became more politically involved with the south-central city-states of Ancient Greece, but it also retained more archaic features like the palace-culture, first at Aegae (modern Vergina) then at Pella, resembling Mycenaean culture more than classic Hellenic city-states, and other archaic customs, like Philip's multiple wives in addition to his Epirote queen Olympias, mother of Alexander. Another archaic remnant was the very persistence of a hereditary monarchy which wielded formidable and sometimes absolute power, although this was at times checked by the landed aristocracy, and often disturbed by power struggles within the royal family itself. This contrasted sharply with the Greek cultures further south, where the ubiquitous city-states mostly possessed aristocratic or democratic institutions; the de facto monarchy of tyrants, in which heredity was usually more of an ambition rather than the accepted rule; and the limited, predominantly military and sacerdotal, power of the twin hereditary Spartan kings. The same might have held true of feudal institutions like serfdom, which may have persisted in Macedon well into historical times. Such institutions were abolished by city-states well before Macedon's rise (most notably by the Athenian legislator Solon's famous  seisachtheia laws).   Amyntas had three sons; the first two, Alexander II and Perdiccas III reigned only briefly. Perdiccas III's infant heir was deposed by Amyntas' third son, Philip II of Macedon, who made himself king and ushered in a period of Macedonian dominance in Greece. Under Philip II, (359&ndash;336 BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the Paeonians, Thracians, and Illyrians. Among other conquests, he annexed the regions of Pelagonia and Southern Paeonia.Growth of Macedonia 4th (century) BC  Philip redesigned the army of Macedon adding a number of variations to the traditional hoplite force to make it far more effective. He added the hetairoi, a well-armoured heavy cavalry, and more light infantry, both of which added greater flexibility and responsiveness to the force. He also lengthened the spear and shrank the shield of the main infantry force, increasing its offensive capabilities. Philip began to rapidly expand the borders of his kingdom. He first campaigned in the north against non-Greek peoples such as the Illyrians, securing his northern border and gaining much prestige as a warrior. He next turned east, to the territory along the northern shore of the Aegean. The most important city in this area was Amphipolis, which controlled the way into Thrace and also was near valuable silver mines. This region had been part of the Athenian Empire, and Athens still considered it as in their sphere. The Athenians attempted to curb the growing power of Macedonia, but were limited by the outbreak of the Social War. They could also do little to halt Philip when he turned his armies south and took over most of Thessaly. Control of Thessaly meant Philip was now closely involved in the politics of central Greece. 356 BC saw the outbreak of the Third Sacred War that pitted Phocis against Thebes and its allies. Thebes recruited the Macedonians to join them and at the Battle of Crocus Field Phillip decisively defeated Phocis and its Athenian allies. As a result, Macedonia became the leading state in the Amphictyonic League and Phillip became head of the Pythian Games, firmly putting the Macedonian leader at the centre of the Greek political world. In the continuing conflict with Athens Philip marched east through Thrace in an attempt to capture Byzantium and the Bosphorus, thus cutting off the Black Sea grain supply that provided Athens with much of its food. The siege of Byzantium failed, but Athens realized the grave danger the rise of Macedon presented and under Demosthenes built a coalition of many of the major states to oppose the Macedonians. Most importantly Thebes, which had the strongest ground force of any of the city states, joined the effort. The allies met the Macedonians at the Battle of Chaeronea and were decisively defeated, leaving Philip and the Macedonians the unquestioned master of Greece. Though Persian rule in the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper had ended for over a century, their influences, especially on the Macedonians and their Balkan neighbours (especially Thracians), remained strongly visible. As historians Roisman and Worthington state, to Macedonian rulers, Achaemenid stood as an example of statehood and mores. This is especially true of Philip II as he built his power and created many institutions to imitate those known from the Achaemenid Empire. Thus, inspired by Persian achievements, Philip established a Royal Secretary and Archive, and aimed at the elevation of the political as well as religious level, and he used a special throne (Gr. thronos) borrowed from the Achaemenid court to demonstrate his elevated rank. The institution of the Royal Pages (Gr. Paides Basilikoi) was probably inspired by Achaemenid prototype - among their duties, Arrian mentions mounting the king on his horse "in the Persian style". The status of Thrace in 342-334 under the Macedonian sway as a kind of regular satrapy resembled Achaemenid administrative practices, and the organization of the royal court, generally, followed in a fashion of the Achaemenid tradition. Some scholars deny Philip's international borrowings from Persian tradition, but it must be said that states do not develop in a vacuum. For an increasingly powerful Macedonia, the most immediate model of a great monarchy was Persia.  {{Expand section|1= * Timeline and geography, * Shift in institutions,  * Founded cities and legacy |date=October 2014}} [[File:MacedonEmpire.jpg|thumb|250px|Alexander's empire at the time of its maximum expansion.]]  Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]] ([[356 BC|356]]&ndash;323 BC), managed to briefly extend Macedonian power not only over the central Greek city-states by becoming [[Hegemon]] of the [[League of Corinth]] (also known as the "Hellenic League"), but also to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian empire]], including [[Egypt]] and lands as far east as present-day [[Pakistan]] and the fringes of [[India]]. Alexander helped spread the Greek culture and learning through his vast empire. Although the empire fractured into multiple Hellenic regimes shortly after his death, his conquests left a lasting legacy, not least in the new Greek-speaking cities founded across Persia's western territories, heralding the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period. In the partition of Alexander's empire among the ''[[Diadochi]]'', Macedonia fell to the [[Antipatrid dynasty]], which was overthrown by the [[Antigonid dynasty]] after only a few years, in 294 BC.  ===Hellenistic era=== {{further|Antipatrid dynasty|Antigonid dynasty}}  [[Antipater]] and his son [[Cassander]] gained control of Macedonia but it slid into a long period of civil strife following Cassander's death in 297 BC. It was ruled for a while by [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius I]] ([[294 BC|294]]&ndash;288 BC) but fell into civil war.  Demetrius' son, [[Antigonus II]] ([[277 BC|277]]&ndash;239 BC), defeated a [[Galatia]]n invasion as a ''[[condottiere]]'', and regained his family's position in Macedonia; he successfully restored order and prosperity there, though he lost control of many of the Greek city-states. He established a stable monarchy under the [[Antigonid dynasty]]. [[Antigonus III]] ([[229 BC|239]]&ndash;221 BC) built on these gains by re-establishing Macedonian power across the region.  What is notable about the Macedonian regime during the Hellenistic times is that it was the only  successor state to the Empire that maintained the old archaic perception of kingship, and never adopted the ways of the Hellenistic monarchy. Thus the king was never deified in the same way that Ptolemies and Seleucids were in Egypt and Asia respectively, and never adopted the custom of [[Proskynesis]]. The ancient Macedonians during the Hellenistic times were still addressing their kings in a far more casual way than the subjects of the rest of the Diadochi, and the kings were still consulting with their aristocracy (Philoi) in the process of making their decisions.  ===Conflict with Rome=== {{main|Macedonian Wars}} [[File:Map Macedonia 200 BC-fr.svg|thumb|Kingdom of Macedon under Philip V.]]  Under [[Philip V of Macedon]] ([[221 BC|221]]&ndash;179 BC) and his son [[Perseus of Macedon]] ([[179 BC|179]]&ndash;168 BC), the kingdom clashed with the rising power of the [[Roman Republic]]. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Macedon fought a [[Macedonian wars|series of wars]] with Rome. Two major losses that led to the end of the kingdom were in 197 BC when Rome defeated Philip V, and 168 BC when Rome defeated Perseus. The overall losses resulted in the defeat of Macedon, the deposition of the Antigonid dynasty and the dismantling of the Macedonian kingdom. [[Andriscus]]' brief success at reestablishing the monarchy in 149 BC was quickly followed by his defeat the following year and the establishment of direct [[Roman Republic|Roman]] rule and the organization of Macedon as the [[Roman province of Macedonia]].  ==Institutions== {{refimprove section|date=October 2014}} The political organization of the Macedonian kingdom was a three-level pyramid: on the top, the King and the nation, at the foot, the civic organizations (cities and ''éthnē''), and between the two, the districts. The study of these different institutions has been considerably renewed thanks to [[epigraphy]], which has given us the possibility to reread the indications given us by ancient literary sources such as [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]]. They show that the Macedonian institutions were near to those of the Greek federal states, like the [[Aetolian League|Aetolian]] and [[Achaean League|Achaean]] leagues, whose unity was reinforced by the presence of the king.  [[File:Phillip Museum.jpg|thumb|The [[Vergina Sun]], the 16-ray star covering the royal burial larnax of Philip II of Macedon, discovered at site of the ancient [[Aigai, Macedonia|Aigai]].]]  ===The King=== The [[Monarch|king]] ({{lang|grc|[[Βασιλεύς]]}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Basileús}}'') headed the central administration: he led the kingdom from its capital, Pella, and in his royal palace was conserved the state's archive. He was helped in carrying out his work by the [[Royal Secretary]] ({{lang|grc|βασιλικὸς γραμματεύς}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|basilikós grammateús}}''), whose work was of primary importance, and by the [[Synhedrion|Council]]. The title "king" (''basileús'') may have not officially been used by the Macedonian regents until [[Alexander the Great]], whose "usage of it may have been influenced by his ambivalent position in Persia."<ref>{{harvnb|Errington|1974|p=20}}.</ref>  The king was commander of the army, head of the Macedonian religion, and director of diplomacy. Also, only he could conclude treaties, and, until [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]], mint coins.  The number of civil servants was limited: the king directed his kingdom mostly in an indirect way, supporting himself principally through the local magistrates, the epistates, with whom he constantly kept in touch.  ====Succession==== Royal succession in Macedon was hereditary, male, [[patrilineal]] and generally respected the principle of [[primogeniture]]. There was also an elective element: when the king died, his designated heir, generally but not always the eldest son, had first to be accepted by the council and then presented to the general Assembly to be acclaimed king and obtain the oath of fidelity.  As can be seen, the succession was far from being automatic, more so considering that many Macedonian kings died violently, without having made dispositions for the succession, or having assured themselves that these would be respected. This can be seen with [[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]], slain by the [[Illyria]]ns, [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] assassinated by [[Pausanias of Orestis]], [[Alexander the Great]], suddenly died of malady, etc. Succession crises were frequent, especially up to the 4th century BC, when the magnate families of Upper Macedonia still cultivated the ambition of overthrowing the Argead dynasty and to ascend to the throne.  [[File:Pella House atrium.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An atrium with a pebble-mosaic paving, in Pella, Greece]]  ====Finances==== The king was the simple guardian and administrator of the treasure of Macedon and of the king's incomes ({{lang|grc|βασιλικά}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|basiliká}}''), which belonged to the Macedonians: and the tributes that came to the kingdom thanks to the treaties with the defeated people also went to the Macedonian people, and not to the king. Even if the king was not accountable for his management of the kingdom's entries, he may have felt responsible to defend his administration on certain occasions: [[Arrian]] tells us that during the [[mutiny]] of Alexander's soldiers at [[Opis]] in 324 BC, Alexander detailed the possessions of his father at his death to prove he had not abused his charge.  It is known from Livy and Polybius that the ''basiliká'' included the following sources of income: *The '''mines''' of gold and silver (for example those of the [[Pangaeus]]), which were the exclusive possession of the king, and which permitted him to strike currency, as already said his sole privilege till Philip V, who conceded to cities and districts the right of coinage for the lesser denominations, like bronze. *The '''forests''', whose timber was highly valued by the Greek cities to build their ships: in particular, it is known that [[Athens]] made commercial treaties with Macedon in the 5th century BC to import the timber necessary for the construction and the maintenance of its fleet of war. *The royal '''landed properties''', lands that were annexed to the royal domain through conquest, and that the king exploited either directly, in particular through servile workforce made up of prisoners of war, or indirectly through a leasing system. *The '''port duties''' on commerce (importation and exportation taxes).  The most common way to exploit these different sources of income was by leasing: the [[Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotle]] reports in the ''[[Economics (Aristotle)|Oeconomica]]'' that [[Amyntas III of Macedon|Amyntas III]] (or maybe Philip II) doubled the kingdom's port revenues with the help of [[Callistratus of Aphidnae|Callistratus]], who had taken refuge in Macedon, bringing them from 20 to 40 [[talent (weight)|talents]] per year. To do this, the exploitation of the harbour taxes was given every year at the private offering the highest bidding. It is also known from Livy that the mines and the forests were leased for a fixed sum under Philip V, and it appears that the same happened under the Argead dynasty: from here possibly comes the leasing system that was used in [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic Egypt]].  Except for the king's properties, land in Macedon was free: Macedonians were free men and did not pay land taxes on private grounds. Even extraordinary taxes like those paid by the Athenians in times of war did not exist. Even in conditions of economic peril, like what happened to Alexander in 334 BC and Perseus in 168 BC, the monarchy did not tax its subjects but raised funds through loans, first of all by his Companions, or raised  the cost of the leases.  The king could grant the ''atelíē'' ({{lang|grc|ἀτελίη}}), a privilege of tax exemption, as Alexander did with those Macedonian families which had losses in the [[battle of the Granicus]] in May [[334 BC|334]]: they were exempted from paying tribute for leasing royal grounds and commercial taxes.  Extraordinary incomes came from the spoils of war, which were divided between the king and his men. At the time of Philip II and Alexander, this was a considerable source of income. A considerable part of the gold and silver objects taken at the time of the European and Asian campaigns were melted in ingots and then sent to the monetary foundries of [[Pella]] and [[Amphipolis]], most active of the kingdom at that time: an estimate judges that during the reign of Alexander only the mint of Amphipolis struck about 13 million silver [[Greek drachma|tetradrachms]].  ===The Assembly=== All the kingdom's citizen-soldiers gathered in a popular assembly, which was held at least twice a year, in spring and in autumn, with the opening and the closing of the campaigning season.  This assembly (''{{lang|grc-Latn|koinê ekklesia}}'' or ''{{lang|grc-Latn|koinon makedonôn}}''), of the army in times of war, of the people in times of peace, is called by the king and played a significant role through the acclamation of the kings and in capital trials; it could be consulted (without obligation) in matters of foreign policy (declarations of war, treaties) and for the appointment of high state officials. In the majority of these occasions, the Assembly did nothing but ratify the proposals of a smaller body, the Council. It was also the Assembly which voted the honors, and sent embassies, during its two annual meetings. It was abolished by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] at the time of their reorganization of Macedonia in 167 BC, to prevent, according to [[Livy]], that a demagogue could make use of it as a means to revolt against their authority.  ===Council (''Synedrion'')=== The Council was a small group formed among some of the most eminent Macedonians, chosen by the king to assist him in the government of the kingdom. As such it was not a representative assembly, but notwithstanding that on certain occasions it could be expanded with the admission of representatives of the cities and of the civic corps of the kingdom.  The members of the Council (''synedroi'') belong to three categories: * The ''[[somatophylakes]]'' (in Greek literally "bodyguards") were noble Macedonians chosen by the king to serve to him as honorary bodyguards, but especially as close advisers. It was a particularly prestigious honorary title. In the times of Alexander there were seven of them. * The Friends (''[[philoi]]'') or the king's Companions (''basilikoi [[Companion cavalry|hetairoi]]'') were named for life by the king among the Macedonian aristocracy. * The most important generals of the army (''hégémones tôn taxéôn''), also named by the king.  The king had in reality less power in the choice of the members of the Council than appearances would warrant; this was because many of the kingdom's most important noblemen were members of the Council by birth-right.  The Council primarily exerted a probouleutic function with respect to the Assembly: it prepared and proposed the decisions which the Assembly would have discussed and voted, working in many fields such as the designation of kings and regents, as of that of the high administrators and the declarations of war. It was also the first and final authority for all the cases which did not involve capital punishment.  The Council gathered frequently and represented the principal body of government of the kingdom. Any important decision taken by the king was subjected before it for deliberation.  Inside the Council ruled the democratic principles of ''isegoria'' (equality of word) and of ''parrhesia'' (freedom of speech), to which even the king subjected himself.  After the removal of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] by the Romans in 167 BC, it is possible that the synedrion remained, unlike the Assembly, representing the sole federal authority in Macedonia after the country's division in four ''merides''.  ===Regional districts (''Merides'')=== The creation of an intermediate territorial administrative level between the central government and the cities should probably be attributed to Philip II: this reform corresponded with the need to adapt the kingdom's institutions to the great expansion of Macedon under his rule. It was no longer practical to convene all the Macedonians in a single general assembly, and the answer to this problem was the creation of four regional districts, each with a regional assembly. These territorial divisions clearly did not follow any historical or traditional internal divisions; they were simply artificial administrative lines.  This said, it should be noted that the existence of these districts is not attested with certainty (by [[numismatics]]) before the beginning of the 2nd century BC.  ==See also== {{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}} *[[Ancient Macedonians]] *[[Ancient Macedonian army]] *[[Ancient Greece]] *[[List of kings of Macedon]] *[[Alexander the Great]] *[[Diadochi]] *[[Seleucid Empire]] *[[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] *[[Upper Macedonia]] *[[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]] {{Refend}}  ==References==  ===Citations=== {{reflist|30em}}  ===Sources=== {{refbegin|2}} *{{cite web|last=Autenrieth|first=Georg|title=A Homeric Dictionary for Schools and Colleges|year=1891|location=New York|publisher=Harper and Brothers|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|last=Bard|first=Katheryn A.|title=Encyclopaedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt|year=1999|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-13-466524-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MH7sAgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Joseph M.|title=Moral Codes and Social Structure in Ancient Greece: A Sociology of Greek Ethics from Homer to the Epicureans and Stoics|location=Albany, NY|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1996|isbn=0-7914-3042-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCM9D9fyCoQC|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|last=Cawkwell|first=George|authorlink=George Cawkwell|title=Philip of Macedon|location=London, UK|publisher=[[Faber & Faber]]|year=1978|isbn=0-571-10958-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-mUQgAACAAJ|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|last=Chamoux|first=François|title=Hellenistic Civilization|location=Oxford, UK|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|year=2002|isbn=0-631-22241-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1kr4YGTA2AC|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|last=Errington|first=Robert Malcolm|title=A History of Macedonia|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|publisher=University of California Press|year=1990|isbn=0-520-06319-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYgkqP_s1PQC|ref=harv}} *{{cite journal|last=Errington|first=Robert M.|title=Macedonian 'Royal Style' and Its Historical Significance|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=94|year=1974|pages=20–37|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/630417|ref=harv|doi=10.2307/630417}} *{{cite book|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp|title=The Ancient Greeks: A Critical History|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-03314-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjeM0kcp8swC|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin Lane|title=Alexander the Great|year=1986|origyear=1973|location=New York and London|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-008878-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i1-b90sBNH4C|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Jonathan M.|title=Ethnic Identity in Greek Antiquity|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-521-78999-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4Am6gcP0GsC|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=J.
