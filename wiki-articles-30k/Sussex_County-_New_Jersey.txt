  Sussex County is the northernmost county in the State of New Jersey. Its county seat is Newton. It is part of the New York City Metropolitan Area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the county had 149,265 residents, an increase of 5,099 (3.5%) over the 144,166 persons enumerated in the 2000 Census, retaining its position as the 17th-most populous county among the state's 21 counties.NJ Labor Market Views, New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, March 15, 2011.

The county is part of the Skylands Region, a term promoted by the New Jersey Commerce, Economic Growth, & Tourism Commission to encourage tourism.  In the western half of the county, several state and federal parks have kept the large tracts of land undeveloped and in their natural states.  The eastern half of the county has had more suburban development because of its proximity to more populated areas and commercial development zones. Until the mid-20th century, most of Sussex County's economy was based on agriculture (chiefly dairy farming) and the mining industry.  With the decline of these industries in the 1960s, Sussex County was transformed into a bedroom community that absorbed population shifts from New Jersey's urban areas. Recent studies estimate that 60 percent of Sussex County residents work outside of the county, many seeking or maintaining employment in New York City or New Jersey's more suburban and urban areas.  The area of Sussex County and its surrounding region was occupied for approximately 8,000-10,000 years by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples.Kraft, Herbert C. The Lenape-Delaware Indian Heritage: 10,000 B.C. to A.D. 2000. (Stanhope, New Jersey: Lenape Books, 2001). At the time of European encounter, the Munsee Indians inhabited the region.  The Munsee were a loosely organized division of the Lenape (or Lenni Lenape), a Native American people also called "Delaware Indians" after their historic territory along the Delaware River. The Lenape inhabited the mid-Atlantic coastal areas and inland along the Hudson and Delaware rivers.Goddard, Ives; and Trigger, Bruce G. (1978) “Delaware” in Handbook of North American Indians, vol. 15: Northeast. Washington. 213–239  The Munsee spoke a very distinct dialect of the Lenape and inhabited a region bounded by the Hudson River, the head waters of the Delaware River and the Susquehanna River, and south to the Lehigh River and Conewago Creek.Grumet, Robert Steven.

The Dutch-Munsee Encounter in America: The Struggle for Sovereignty in the Hudson Valley. (New York: Berghahn Books, 2006).  As a result of disruption following the French and Indian War (1756–1763) the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and later Indian removals from the eastern United States, the main Lenape groups now live in Ontario  in Canada, and in Wisconsin and Oklahoma in the United States.Keenan, Jerry. Encyclopedia of American Indian Wars, 1492–1890. (New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 1999), 234; Moore, Charles. The Northwest Under Three Flags, 1635–1796. (New York and London: Harper & Brothers, 1900), 151.Weslager, Clinton A. The Delaware Indians: A History. (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1972).  As early as 1690, Dutch and French Huguenot colonists from towns along the Hudson River Valley in New York began permanently settling in the Upper Delaware Valley (known as the "Minisink").  The route these Dutch settlers had taken was the path of an old Indian trail and became the route of the Old Mine Road and stretches of present-date U.S. Route 209.Decker, Amelia Stickney. That Ancient Trail. (Trenton, NJ: Privately published, 1942, reprinted Newton, NJ: Sussex County Historical Society, 2003). These Dutch settlers penetrated the Minisink Valley and settled as far south as the Delaware Water Gap, by 1731 this valley had been incorporated as Walpack Precinct. Throughout the 18th century, immigrants from the Rheinland Palatinate in Germany and Switzerland fled religious wars and poverty to arrive in Philadelphia and New York City. Several German families began leaving Philadelphia to settle along river valleys in Northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley in the 1720s, spreading north into Sussex County in the 1740s and 1750s as additional German emigrants arrived.Chambers, Theodore Frelinghuysen. The Early Germans of New Jersey: Their History, Churches, and Genealogies (Dover, New Jersey, Dover Printing Company, 1895), passim.Armstrong, William C. Pioneer Families of Northwestern New Jersey (Lambertville, New Jersey: Hunterdon House, 1979). Also during this time, Scottish settlers from Elizabethtown and Perth Amboy, and English settlers from these cities, Long Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts, came to New Jersey and moved up the tributaries of the Passaic and Raritan rivers, settling in the eastern sections of present-day Sussex and Warren counties. By the 1750s, residents of this area began to petition colonial authorities for a new county to be formed; they complained of the inconvenience of long travel to conduct business with the government and the courts. By this time, four large townships had been created in this sparsely populated Northwestern region: Walpack Township (before 1731), Greenwich Township (before 1738), Hardwick Township (1750) and Newtown Township (1751). On June 8, 1753, Sussex County was created from these four municipalities, which had been part of Morris County when Morris stretched over all of northwestern New Jersey. Sussex County at this time encompassed present-day Sussex and Warren Counties and its boundaries were drawn by the New York-New Jersey border to the north, the Delaware River to the west, and the Musconetcong River to the south and east.Paterson, William. Laws of the State of New Jersey (Newark, NJ: Matthias Day, 1800), 15. Note: the "great pond" referenced in the legal boundaries of the act is an 18th-century reference to Lake Hopatcong. After several decades of debate over where to hold the sessions of the county's courts, the state legislature eventually voted to divide Sussex County in two, using a line drawn from the juncture of the Flat Brook and Delaware River in a southeasterly direction to the Musconetcong River running through the Yellow Frame Presbyterian Church in present-day Fredon Township (then part of Hardwick).State of New Jersey. Acts of the Legislature of the State of New Jersey, (1824), 146–147. The landmark used for drawing the boundary through Yellow Frame was the Presbyterian Church edifice torn down in 1898. On November 20, 1824, Warren County was created from the southern territory of the Sussex County.   Throughout the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, Sussex County's economy was largely centered around agriculture and the mining of iron and zinc ores.  Early settlers established farms whose operations were chiefly focused towards subsistence agriculture.  Because of geological constraints, Sussex County's agricultural production was centered around dairy farming.  Several farms had orchards—typically apples and peaches—and surplus fruit and grains were often distilled or brewed into alcoholic beverages (hard ciders, applejack and fruit brandies).  This was the economic model until the mid-19th century when advances in food preservation and the introduction of railroads (e.g. the Sussex Railroad) into the area allowed Sussex County to transport farm products throughout the region.  Railroads also promoted the building of factories as companies relocated to the area at the end of the 19th century—including that of the H.W. Merriam Shoe Company (1873) in Newton.Ricord, Frederick W. (editor). Biographical Encyclopedia: Successful Men of New Jersey. (New York: New Jersey Historical Publishing Co., 1896), 1:47. The Highlands Region of Northwestern New Jersey has proven to possess rich deposits of iron ore. In the mid 18th century, several entrepreneurial colonists began mining iron in area around Andover, Hamburg, and Franklin present-day Sussex County and establishing forges and furnaces to create pig iron and bar iron.  During the American Revolution, the Quartermaster Department of the Continental Army complained to Congress of difficulties in acquiring iron to support the war effort and the Congress ordered two colonels, Benjamin Flower and Thomas Maybury to take possession of the iron works at Andover in order to equip General Washington's army. According to local tradition, Andover Forge forged the The Great Chain used at West Point to keep British naval vessels from coming up the Hudson River during the Revolution, but other sources say the chains were forged in Orange County, New York. During the middle of the 19th century, under the management of Cooper and Hewitt, the Andover mine produced 50,000 tons of iron ore each year. The firm manufactured railroad rails and the country's first structural steel, which and led to the building of railroads and commercial development in the county. Iron from the Andover mines was fashioned into cable wire for the bridge built at Niagara Falls and for the beams used to rebuild Princeton University's Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey after a fire undermined the structure in 1855.  During the American Civil War, Andover iron found its way into rifle barrels and cannonballs just as it had during the Revolution years before. As deposits were depleted, the iron mining industry began to diminish by the mid-19th century. During the late 19th century, prolific American inventor Thomas Edison began to explore the commercial opportunities of processing poor-quality low-grade iron ore to combat the growing scarcity of iron deposits in the United States.Woodside, Martin. Thomas A. Edison: The Man Who Lit Up the World. (New York: Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2007), 73–74. He began to purchase mining companies in Sussex County in the 1880s and consolidating their assets.Edison Companies: Mining in The Thomas Edison Papers. Rutgers University. Accessed August 3, 2013. He developed a process of crushing and milling iron-bearing minerals and separating iron ore from the material through large electromagnets, and built one of the world's largest ore-crushing mills near Ogdensburg. Completed in 1889, the factory contained three giant electromagnets and was intended to process up to 1200 tons of iron ore every day. However, technical difficulties repeatedly thwarted production.Peterson, M.

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Global History Network. August 3, 2009. Accessed September 24, 2011. However, in the 1890s, richer soft-grade iron ore deposits located in Minnesota's Iron Range rendered Edison's Ogdensburg operation unprofitable and he closed the works in 1900.

In the early 19th century, Samuel Fowler (1779–1844) settled in Franklin Furnace (now Franklin) to open up a medical practice, but is largely known for his interest in mineralogy which led to his developing commercial uses for zinc and for discovery of several rare minerals (chiefly various ores of zinc).United States Congress.

Fowler, who later briefly served in elected political office, operated the local iron works and bought several abandoned zinc and iron mines in the area. Shortly after his death, two companies were created to exploit the iron and zinc deposits in this region; they acquired the rights to Fowler's holdings in Franklin and nearby Sterling Hill. These companies later merged to form the New Jersey Zinc Corporation (today known as Horsehead Industries). At this time, Russian, Chilean, British, Irish, Hungarian and Polish immigrants came to Franklin to work in the mines, and the population of Franklin swelled from 500 (in 1897) to over 3,000 (in 1913).Truran, William R. Images of America: Franklin, Hamburg, Ogdensburg, and Hardyston. (Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing, 2004). Declining deposits in the Franklin area, the expense of pumping groundwater from mine shafts, tax disputes and misdirected investments by the company led to the abandonment of the mines.Squires, Patricia. "OGDENSBURG JOURNAL; Old Mine Transformed Into Museum" in The New York Times (9 December 1990). Accessed August 3, 2013. Today, both the Franklin and Sterling Hill mines are operated as museums. Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, construction or improvements of Interstate 80, Route 181 and Route 23 triggered rapid growth to Sussex County. Since 1950, the population has increased from 34,423 people to 130,943 people in 1990. This has caused Sussex County to begin developing into a light suburban atmosphere, instead of the sparsely populated rural region it once was, especially in the eastern half of the county.  Around 450 million years ago the Martinsburg Shale was uplifted when a chain of volcanic islands collided with proto North America.  These islands slid over the North American plate, and deposited rock on top of the plate, forming the Highlands and Kittatinny Valley. At that time the western part of Sussex County was under a shallow inland sea.  Fossils of sea shells and fish can be found west of the Kittatinny ridge. Then approximately 400 million years ago, a small, narrow continent collided with North America. Pressure from the collision, created heat in the bed rock which folded and faulted the Silurian Shawangunk Conglomerate that was under the shallow sea. The pressure created intense heat, melted the quartzite, and allowed it to bend, creating an uplift. as cooling occurred this cemented the quartz pebbles and conglomerate together. This is how the Kittatinny Ridge was created.  The strike from this continent was from the south east, this is why the Kittatinny ridge is on a northeast-southwest axis. The Wisconsin glacier which covered the entire county from 23,000B.C to 13,000 B.C. created many lakes and streams.  The glacier covered Kittatinny mountain. As climate warmed around 13,000 B.C. the area was first a tundra with lichens and mosses.  After a few thousand years coniferous forests began to grow.  As climate grew warmer around 8000 B.C., deciduous forests began to grow with nut trees such as oak, and maple.  Around 3000 B.C. other nut bearing trees began to grow such as hickory, butternut, walnut and beech.  This allowed the Paleo Indian populations to increase. The county is drained by the Paulinskill River, the Flatbrook, which drain into the Delaware River, the Wallkill River which flows north to the Hudson River.  There are many smaller creeks that drain into these water sheds.

Dividing the Kittatinny Valley (and the Ridge and Valley Province) from the Highlands region is a narrow fault of Hardyston Quartzite. Many of the mountains in the Highlands are not part of a solid, linear ridge and tend to randomly rise from the surrounding land as the result of folds, faults and intrusions.  Elevations in the Highlands region range from 1,000 to 1,500 feet. The more prominent mountains in this area are Hamburg Mountain (elevation: ), Wawayanda Mountain (elevation ), Sparta Mountain (elevation: ) and Pochuck Mountain (elevation: ) which form a ridge along the county's eastern flank.  Sussex County's rivers and watersheds flow in three directions; north to the Hudson River, west and south to the Delaware River, and east toward Newark Bay. Historically, these rivers and streams were used to power various types of mills (i.e. grist mills, fulling mills, etc.), transport goods to market, and later to generate electric power (after 1880).

According to the Natural Resource Conservation Service, Sussex County soils are derived from parent materials that are largely till and glaciofluvial deposits, alluvium, and organic matter deposits.  Till is the rock of soil material transported or deposited by glacial ice.  In this case, the most recent glaciation (i.e. the last ice age), the Wisconsinian continental glacier, deposited a till plain composed of ground and recessional moraines.  This glaciation reached its maximum extent roughly 22,000 years ago (20,000 B.C.E.).  Glaciofluvial deposits (or "outwash") are rock and soil materials that melting glaciers deposit as the glacier recedes.  Alluvium is materials that are deposited by floodwaters from engorged bodies of water—chiefly streams and rivers.  Organic deposits are largely the result of decomposing plant material.See also: Salisbury, Rollin D. The Glacial Geology of New Jersey, Volume V of the Final Report of the State Geologist.

This region receives approximately forty to fifty inches of snow per year and generally more snowfall that the rest of Northern New Jersey and the Northern Climate Zone.Office of the New Jersey State Climatologist  This phenomenon is attributed to the orographic lift of the Kittatinny Ridge which impacts local weather patterns by increasing humidity and precipitation, providing the ski resorts of Vernon Valley in the northeastern part of this region with increased snowfall.Carney, Leo.

However, recent surveys indicate that in the county's town centers, Sussex Borough (15.1%), Newton (12.8%) and Andover Borough (12.7%), poverty levels reach double-digits. Of these poverty-level residents, an estimated 44% are employed, many of them underemployed despite working multiple jobs. As of the 2010 Census, the county's unemployment rate was 11.0%.  The Census Bureau reported a population of 118,420 persons (above age 16) available for the labor force of which 82,449 (69.6%) were actively employed in civilian labor, and 35,971 (30.4%) were not in the labor force. Early industry and commerce chiefly centered on agriculture, milling, and iron mining.  As iron deposits were exhausted, mining shifted toward zinc deposits near Franklin and Ogdensburg during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The local economy expanded due to the introduction of railroads and shortly after the Civil War, the town centers hosted factories.  However, the factories, railroads and mining declined by the late 1960s.  Today, Sussex County features a mix of rural farmland, forests and suburban development. Because agriculture (chiefly dairy farming) has decreased and that the county hosts little industry, Sussex County is considered a "bedroom community" as most residents commute to neighboring counties (Bergen, Essex and Morris counties) or to New York City for work. Although Sussex County's dairy farming industry has declined significantly in the last 50 years it is still the majority of agricultural production in the region.Sussex County Comprehensive Farmland Preservation Plan Update (May 2008). Chapter II. Accessed July 10, 2012.  Trucking has replaced railroads in the transportation of milk products to regional production facilities and markets.  Rising taxes, regulation and decreasing profitability in dairy farming have forced farmers to adapt by growing other products or converting their farms to other uses.  Many farmers have sold their properties to real estate developers who have built residential housing.  Many Sussex County farms are nursery farms producing ornamental trees, plants and flowers used in horticulture, floristry or landscaping. Christmas trees and nursery and greenhouse plants contribute to 51% of the county's annual crop revenues but account for 30% of crop production. Despite the decline of dairy farming, it is still the largest contributor to the county's annual agricultural revenues.  According to the Sussex County Comprehensive Farmland Preservation Plan (2008):  According to county agricultural statistics, 17.3% of all crop sales ($1.4 million in 2002) were in hay.  Nearly 80% of tilled farmland, or , on 43% of the farms in the county is dedicated to hay production.  Much of hay is grown for feed on livestock farms — especially dairy farms — and never makes it to market and is therefore not included in federal agricultural census data.

With the repeal of several prohibition-era alcohol laws in 1981, 43 wineries have become licensed and are presently operating in the state.  New Jersey wines have grown in stature due to increased marketing and quality, recent successes and awards in competitions, and appreciation by critics.  Sussex County is home to three established and operating wineries and three more are in development.Garden State Wine Growers Association – Wineries, Accessed July 10, 2012. Sussex County's industrial and manufacturing base is no longer towards heavy industry and mining.  Today, companies like Thorlabs, are located here. Because of its lower population, large amount of land area preserved by state and federal parks and open space preservation programs, and conservative politics, Sussex County has lower spending on education (through regional school districts) and government services and thus has lower taxes than its neighboring counties.  Most municipalities do not have police departments or paid firemen—instead relying on the rural service of the New Jersey State Police and volunteer fire departments. In several municipalities, taxes on an acre of land, depending on the condition and size of the house, could be as low as $1,500 a year. Typical property taxes in the county are in the $4,000–$8,000 a year range.  Sussex County is governed by a five-member Board of Chosen Freeholders who are elected in partisan elections on an at-large basis to serve three-year terms of office as part of the November general election.
