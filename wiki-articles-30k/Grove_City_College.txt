   Grove City College is a Christian liberal arts college in Grove City, Pennsylvania, about  north of Pittsburgh. According to the College Bulletin, its stated threefold mission is to provide an excellent education at an affordable price in a thoroughly Christian environment.2005–2006 Bulletin, p. 7 Former College president Richard Jewell has said, "The two tenets that this school is most about are faith and freedom." The school emphasizes a humanities core curriculum, which endorses the Judeo-Christian Western tradition and the free market. While loosely associated with the Presbyterian Church, the college is non-denominational and does not require students to sign a statement of faith, but they are required to attend sixteen chapel services per semester. Founded in 1876 by Isaac C. Ketler,[ ]  the school was originally chartered as Pine Grove Normal Academy. It had twenty-six students in its first year. In 1884, the trustees of Pine Grove Normal Academy in Grove City amended the academy charter to change the name to Grove City College. By charter, the doors of the College were open to qualified students "without regard to religious test or belief." The founders of Grove City College, consciously avoiding narrow sectarianism, held a vision of Christian society transcending denomination, creeds, and confessions. Isaac Ketler was a devout Presbyterian who served as president until 1913. This was a span of 37 years altogether and occurred during a very formative period for the school.[ ]  Grove City was heavily supported by Joseph Newton Pew, founder of the Sun Oil Company. Pew was one of Ketler's grade-school teachers and a lifelong mentor and friend of the educator. Pew, like Ketler a devout Presbyterian and strong believer in the importance of good education, later accepted the presidency of the school's board of trustees. Pew and Ketler's influence continued with their sons, Weir C. Ketler (Grove City president from 1916 to 1956) and John Howard Pew.  During the summer of 1925, J. Gresham Machen gave the lectures that formed the basis of his book, What Is Faith?J. Gresham Machen (1925), What Is Faith?, New York:  Macmillan, "Preface", p. 7. John Howard Pew graduated from the college in 1900 and, like his father, became trustee-board president. J. Howard Pew continued his father's legacy. A Presbyterian and a conservative, J. Howard Pew insisted that the college operate only on what it received in tuition and fees. In the 1930s, J. Howard Pew, who became the president of Sun Oil Company, was one of the nation's most outspoken critics of the New Deal, so it also was natural that Grove City College look unfavorably upon federal aid and involvement in education and that it would strive to remain the highly independent institution it is today. As World War II began, Grove City College was one of six schools selected by the United States Navy to participate in the highly unusual Electronics Training Program (ETP). Starting March 1942, each month a new group of 100 Navy and Marine students arrived for three months of 14-hour days in concentrated electrical engineering study. ETP admission required passing the Eddy Test, one of the most selective qualifying exams given during the war years.Test and Research Staff, Bureau of Naval Personnel; "Psychological test construction and research in the Bureau of Naval Personnel. Part V. Navy radio technician training program;" American Psychologist, vol 1(3), Mar. 1946, pp 80-90 Professor Russell P. Smith was the program's Director of Instruction. By the fall of 1943, there were only 81 civilian men in the student body; thus, the presence of 300 or so servicemen contributed greatly in sustaining the College. This training at Grove City continued until April 1945; library records show that there were 49 classes graduating 3,759 persons.Dayton, David M.; "The Naval Training School," Mid the Pines: A History of Grove City College, Grove City Alumni Association, 1971Watson, Raymond C., Jr.; Solving the Naval Radar Crisis, Trafford Publishing, 2007, pp. 207-208, ISBN 978-1-4251-6173-6 Under President Dr. Charles S. MacKenzie, the college was the plaintiff-appellee in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case in 1984, Grove City College v. Bell. The ruling came seven years after the school's refusal to sign a Title IX compliance form, which would have subjected the entire school to federal regulations, even ones not yet issued. The court ruled 6–3 that acceptance by students of federal educational grants fell under the regulatory requirements of Title IX, but it limited the application to the school's financial aid department. In 1988, new legislation subjected every department of any educational institution that received federal funding to Title IX requirements. In response, Grove City College withdrew from the Pell Grant program entirely beginning with the 1988–89 academic year, replacing such grants to students with its own program, the Student Freedom Fund. In October 1996, the college withdrew from the Stafford Loan program, providing entering students with replacements on better terms through a program with PNC Bank. Grove City is one of a handful of colleges (along with Hillsdale College, which did likewise after the aforementioned 1984 case) that does not allow its students to accept federal financial aid of any kind, including grants, loans and scholarships. Since 1963, the American Association of University Professors has placed Grove City under censure for violations of tenure and academic freedom. Grove City's administration has been on the AAUP's list of censured administrations longer than any other college that is currently censured. In its report, the AAUP Investigative Committee at Grove City concluded that "the absence of due process [in the dismissal of professors at Grove City] raises... doubts regarding the academic security of any persons who may hold appointment at Grove City College under existing administrative practice. These doubts are of an order of magnitude which obliges us to report them to the academic profession at large." In 2005, Grove City founded its Center for Vision and Values, further advancing its programs in the humanities. The Center aims to educate the world about faith and freedom by giving its faculty members the opportunity to share their scholarship with a community beyond Pennsylvania. The Center for Vision & Values won a 2010 Templeton Freedom Award for Excellence in Promoting Liberty, in the category of “Special Achievement by a University-based Center.” Instituted in the fall of 2003, and named after the late philanthropist and pioneering investor – Sir John Marks Templeton – the Templeton Freedom Awards were the result of a partnership between the John Templeton Foundation and the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, which administers the prize.[ ] In recent years, the college has engaged in many new construction projects, including an expansion to its music and arts center in 2002, a new academic building in 2003, a new student union/bookstore in 2004, and new apartment-style housing in 2006. Grove City's Student Union building was honored with the International Masonry Institute's Golden Trowel Grand Prize for excellence in masonry design and construction in 2005. On February 9, 2011 Grove City College announced that it will break ground for construction of a science, engineering and mathematics building – key components of Grove City Matters: A Campaign to Advance Grove City College, which at $90 million is the largest capital campaign in the college's history. The $37.2-million science, engineering and mathematics building is designed to support new modes of teaching, particularly flexible laboratories and small-group interactions. It will help ensure that Grove City College continues to prepare students for future careers in an increasingly competitive work force, officials said.[ ]  Even more construction projects, and renovations of existing buildings are planned for the next few years. The college acquired an observatory from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania in February 2008 that will be utilized for astronomy classes as well as faculty and student research. The observatory's telescope will be operated remotely, from the college's main campus - more than  away. The purchase of the property, three buildings and equipment inside will pave the way for the addition of an astronomy minor on campus. Through this observatory, the college's physics department plans to work with area public schools as well as other colleges and universities on educational and research projects and draw prospective students who are looking for strong physics programs and astronomy coursework.[ ]  Grove City offers 55 majors in the liberal arts, sciences and engineering.[ ]  The college is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the unit of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools that accredits degree-granting colleges and universities in the Middle States region of the United States. The college's electrical and computer and mechanical engineering programs are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. (ABET).[ ] The Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) a United States organization of degree-granting colleges and universities, includes Grove City College among its list of accredited colleges recognized by U.S. accrediting organizations. Grove City has an acceptance rate around 76%. The average GPA of entering freshmen is 3.74 unweighted and 3.98 weighted.[ ]  The average ACT score of the 2011 incoming freshmen class was 28. The average SAT score of the 2011 incoming freshman class was 1269.[ ]  The average SAT scores were as follows: Math–644; Critical Reading–635; Writing–not reported. Grove City was ranked as the nation's second most politically conservative college by US News and World Report. Human Events Magazine ranks it as one of the cream of the crop in America's conservative colleges. Among all colleges, the widely-followed US News and World Report college rankings place Grove City in the first tier of liberal arts colleges. The conservative think tank Free Congress Foundation, includes Grove City among its list of top colleges that provide excellent liberal arts.[ ] For two consecutive years (2006 and 2007), The Young America's Foundation placed Grove City in its Top 10 Conservative Colleges list. The schools on this list offer coursework and scholarship in conservative thought and emphasize principles including smaller government, strong national defense, free enterprise, and traditional values.[ ]   Fiske Guide to Getting Into the Right College concurs and lists Grove City among its top 10 conservative colleges.[ ]  Consumers Digest Magazine's Top 100 College Values ranks Grove City College, the top value in private liberal arts schools throughout the nation in May 2011.<ref>[http://business-journal.com/grove-city-college-ranked-top-value-p19152-1.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2015}}</ref>  According to the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]]'s 2007 publication of ''[[Choosing the Right College]]'', the 2007 ''US News and World Report'' college guide ranks Grove City the number one "best value" among northern comprehensive colleges – the fifth year running the school has earned that distinction.

Requirements for majors differ, but typically a student is also required to gain mastery in a foreign language and reach some mathematical proficiency. Many Grove City students take one to three general requirements classes in their freshman, sophomore, and sometimes junior years, along with classes for their respective major.  Many students choose Grove City explicitly for its [[Christian]] environment and traditional [[Humanities]] curriculum. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} A three-year required [[Humanities]] sequence focuses on the origin, development and implications of civilization’s seminal ideas and [[worldviews]].

The call-letters were predated by experimental stations at the college dating back to 1914. In 1968, WSAJ-FM was put on the air and currently broadcasts at 91.1&nbsp;MHz, functioning as a learning tool for all students, but especially those in the communication and engineering majors. The 100-watt AM station, operating from a longwire antenna on 1340&nbsp;kHz, was one of the few remaining stations in the US to share time. It surrendered its broadcast license in 2006. The 1,600-watt FM signal covers a 30&nbsp;mi radius in Western Pennsylvania. The station broadcasts fine arts programming, college football and basketball games. It also airs community events and high school sports. Students host weekly music shows during the evening hours when school is in session.  ===Fraternities, sororities, and housing groups=== [[Fraternities and sororities]] live on campus, in pre-selected upperclassman halls. Grove City's fraternities and sororities are local and are not affiliated with the [[National Panhellenic Council]].<ref name="gcc.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc.edu/studentlife/campus-organizations/Pages/Social-Groups.aspx|title=Social Groups|work=gcc.edu|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>  Many of the social fraternities and sororities were established in the early 1900s and are among the country's oldest local fraternities and sororities.  [[Theta Alpha Pi]], which was founded in 1921, has the distinction of being the country's oldest constantly-active local sorority, and it remains active with 63 members in 2014. Over the years, other sororities and one fraternity, Chi Delta Epsilon, have ceased to exist. The most recent sorority to become defunct was the short-lived Delta Chi Omega, which was founded in 1980 and lasted approximately one decade.  Sigma Sigma Sigma, founded in 1917, changed its name to Zeta Zeta Zeta in 1989 in response to threats of trademark infringement litigation from the national sorority [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]]. Other fraternities and sororities have died out (meaning all their active members graduated or left the college) but have been reinstituted via block classes that assumed the organization's name, traditions and practices.  Both fraternities and sororities are overseen by governing bodies. The fraternities each send delegates to weekly meetings of the Interfraternity Council. The sororities' counterpart organization, the Pan-Hellenic Council, also meets each week. In the spring, the two councils hold joint meetings to plan the annual Greek Games. The Greek Games, a multi-day event which involved such activities as water balloon tossing and egg dropping, have declined in notoriety at Grove City College along with the size of Greek organizations; until the 1990s they were well-known on campus, with the majority of the student body either participating or spectating.  The annual Greek Sing includes fraternities, sororities, and housing groups, and remains a popular competition.  {{col-start}} {{col-1-of-3}}  ====Fraternities==== * [[Adelphikos]] (Adels) * Beta Sigma (Betas) * [[Delta Iota Kappa]] (Deeks) * Epsilon Pi (π's) * Omicron Xi (Okies) * Pan Sophic (Pans) * Kappa Alpha Phi (Kaps) * Sigma Alpha Sigma (Sigs) * Phi Tau Alpha (Phi Taus) * Nu Lambda Phi (Nu Lambs) <ref name="gcc.edu"/> {{col-2-of-3}}  ====Sororities==== * Alpha Beta Tau (ABTs) * Gamma Chi (Gamma Chis) * Gamma Sigma Phi (Gamma Sigs) * Phi Sigma Chi (Phi Sigs) * [[Sigma Delta Phi]] (D' Phis) * Sigma Theta Chi (Sig Thets) * [[Theta Alpha Pi]] (Thetas or TAs) * Zeta Zeta Zeta (Zetas) {{col-3-of-3}}  ====Housing groups==== * Rho Rho Rho (Rhos) * Alpha Sigma (Alpha Sigs) * Alpha Omega (AOs) * Delta Rho Sigma (Buffaloes) * Nu Delta Epsilon (Nu Dels) * Phi Omega Sigma (Possums) * Alpha Epsilon Chi (AEX) * Sigma Phi Omicron (Crons) * Zeta Xi Omega (Zenoids) {{col-end}}  ==Athletics== [[File:GroveCityWolverines.png|thumb|left|Official athletics logo.]] {{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}} Grove City College, known athletically as the Wolverines, competes in the [[Presidents' Athletic Conference]] of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].
