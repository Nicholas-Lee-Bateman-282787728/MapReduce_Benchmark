  Long Branch is a beach side city in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city's population was 30,719, reflecting a decline of 621 (-2.0%) from the 31,340 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 2,682 (+9.4%) from the 28,658 counted in the 1990 Census.Table 7.

Long Branch was formed on April 11, 1867, as the Long Branch Commission, from portions of Ocean Township. Long Branch was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 1903, based on the results of a referendum, replacing the Long Branch Commission.Snyder, John P.

Long Branch was a beach resort town in the late 18th century, named for its location along a branch of the South Shrewsbury River.Encyclopaedia Brittanica In the 19th century it was a "Hollywood" of the east, where some of the greatest theatrical and other performers of the day gathered and performed. It was visited by presidents Chester A. Arthur, James A. Garfield, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford B. Hayes, William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson.(2006) The Year in Review, The Long Branch Historical Museum Association, Page 1. Seven Presidents Park, a park near the beach, is named in honor of their visits. The Church of the Presidents, where all seven worshiped, is the only structure left in Long Branch associated with them.Staff. "'Church of the Presidents' To Reopen in Long Branch", The New York Times, May 1, 1950. Accessed July 3, 2012. "'The Church of the Presidents', where Harrison, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, McKinley and Wilson are said to have been worshipers while on seashore vacations, will be reopened June 15 as a house of meditation and as a museum, the Rev. Christopher H. Snyder, vicar, announced today."  President Garfield was brought to Long Branch in the hope that the fresh air and quiet might aid his recovery after being shot on July 2, 1881, an incident that left the assassin's bullet lodged in his spine. He died here on September 19, 1881, exactly two months before his 50th birthday. The Garfield Tea House, constructed from railroad ties that had been laid to carry Garfield's train, is in Elberon.Williams, Carol Gorga. "Restoring historic church WHERE SEVEN PRESIDENTS ELECTED TO WORSHIP", Asbury Park Press, September 24, 2004. Accessed July 3, 2012. "One is the Garfield Tea House, a small structure that was built from the railroad ties used to lay the emergency track that transported a mortally wounded President Garfield from the Elberon train station to the oceanfront Franklyn Cottage, owned by railroad magnate Charles Franklyn, where the president died 12 days later." The famous Long Branch Saloon of the American Old West, located in Dodge City, Kansas, was given its name by its first owner, William Harris, who had moved west from Long Branch, New Jersey, his hometown.Kansas Fun Facts and Trivia, Legends of America. Accessed July 21, 2007. "The Long Branch Saloon really did exist in Dodge City,  Kansas.  One of the owners, William Harris, was a former resident of Long Branch, New Jersey and named the saloon after his hometown in the 1880's." Originally a resort town with a few hotels and large estates and many farms in the early 20th century, Long Branch grew in population. Italian, Irish and Jewish immigrants settled in during this period. By the 1950s, Long Branch like many other towns had developed new residential spots and housing to make room for the growing population. Many of the former farms of Long Branch were transformed into residential suburbs. Many of the estates and a few old historic resorts (with the addition of many new ones) still remain. With the ascendancy of Hollywood in California as a film capital, Long Branch lost much of its activity as a theater spot. In addition, the opening of the Garden State Parkway in the mid-1950s allowed shore visitors to access points further south, which added to Long Branch's decline.  The civil unrest of the 1960s caused riots in neighboring Asbury Park, and many fled the shore cities for the suburban towns west of the beach.  Decades later, the older, more dilapidated parts of the resort town were condemned and redeveloped, in part by using eminent domain legislation. Long Branch still continues to be a popular resort area. Many people from New York City travel or settle into the area to escape the crowded city and enjoy Long Branch's beaches.  The area also attracts some tourists from the Philadelphia area as well. On October 29, 2012, Long Branch was one of many shore communities that were devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Although Sandy's winds were powerful, Long Branch's position between Long Beach Island and Sea Bright gave Long Branch a much larger wall of security because it could not be  engulfed by surrounding waters. Despite this mainland advantage, there were still several instances of flooding in Long Branch during the storm. Many residents went without electricity for 9 to 15 days. The boardwalk was destroyed and the city plans to start rebuilding it in 2015 and finish by summer of 2016.  It is the last boardwalk damaged by Sandy to be rebuilt, and is planned to match that of Pier Village.
