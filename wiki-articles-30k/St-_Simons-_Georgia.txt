  St. Simons is a census-designated place (CDP) located on St. Simons Island in Glynn County, Georgia, United States. The community and the island are interchangeable, known simply as "St. Simons Island", or locally as "The Island".  St. Simons is part of the Brunswick, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, and according to the 2010 census, the CDP had a population of 12,743. Located on the southeast Georgia coast, midway between Savannah and Jacksonville, St. Simons Island is both a seaside resort and residential community. It is the largest of Georgia's renowned Golden Isles (along with Sea Island, Jekyll Island, and privately owned Little St. Simons Island). Visitors are drawn to the Island for its warm climate, beaches, variety of outdoor activities, shops and restaurants, historical sites, and its natural environment. In addition to its base of permanent residents, the island enjoys an influx of both visitors and part-time residents throughout the year. The 2010 Census notes that 26.8% of total housing units are for “seasonal, recreational, or occasional use”. The vast majority of commercial and residential development is located on the southern half of the island. Much of the northern half remains marsh or woodland. A large tract of land in the northeast has been converted to a nature preserve containing trails, historical ruins, and undisturbed maritime forest. The tract, Cannon’s Point Preserve, is open to the public on specified days and hours. Originally inhabited by tribes of the Creek Nation, the area of South Georgia that includes St. Simons Island was contested by the Spaniards, English and French. After securing the Georgia colony, the English cultivated the land for rice and cotton plantations worked by large numbers of African slaves, who created the unique Gullah culture that survives to this day. The primary mode of travel to the island is by automobile via F.J. Torras Causeway. Malcolm McKinnon Airport (IATA: SSI) serves general aviation on the island. St. Simons Island is part of a cluster of barrier islands and marsh hammocks between the [[Altamaha River]] [[Delta (landform)|delta]] to the north, and St. Simons Sound to the south. Sea Island forms the eastern edge of this cluster, with Little St. Simons on the north, and the marshes of Glynn plus the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] to the west.

The island shares many features common to the chain of [[Sea Islands|sea islands]] along the southeastern U.S. coast…sandy beaches on the ocean side, marshes to the west and maritime forests inland. Despite centuries of agriculture and development, a canopy of [[live oak]]s and other hardwoods draped in [[Spanish moss]] continues to shade much of the island. The abundance of food provided by the marshes, [[Estuary|estuaries]] and vegetation attracts a varied assortment of wildlife on land, sea and in the air.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sherpa Guides {{!}} Georgia {{!}} Coast {{!}} Southern Coast {{!}} St. Simons Island|url = http://www.sherpaguides.com/georgia/coast/southern_coast/st_simons_island.html|website = www.sherpaguides.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}</ref>  Commonly sighted land and [[Amphibians|amphibious]] animals include [[white-tailed deer]], marsh [[rabbit]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[mink]]s, [[alligator]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[terrapin]]s and [[frog]]s. Overhead, along the shore and in the marshes, an extensive variety of both native and migratory [[shorebirds]] can be seen year-round. Species include [[sandpiper]]s, [[plover]]s, [[tern]]s, [[gull]]s, [[heron]]s, [[egret]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[osprey]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[American white ibis|white ibis]], [[brown pelican]]s, and the [[Bald eagle|southern bald eagle]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gould's Inlet, St. Simons Island|url = http://www.sherpaguides.com/georgia/wildlife_viewing/colonial_coast/67.html|website = www.sherpaguides.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}</ref>  The area surrounding St. Simons Island and the Altamaha River delta is an important stopover for migrating shorebirds traveling between [[South America]] and their spawning grounds in the [[Canadian Arctic Lands|Canadian arctic]]. As a result of all this avian activity, Gould’s Inlet and East Beach on St. Simons Island is a designated stop on the Colonial Coast Birding Trail.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Georgia's Colonial Coast Birding Trail {{!}} Georgia DNR - Wildlife Resources Division|url = http://georgiawildlife.com/node/1344|website = georgiawildlife.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}</ref>  The waters off St. Simons Island are likewise home to a great variety of sea life, including [[dolphin]]s, [[right whale]]s, a wide diversity of [[Game fish|gamefish]], and the occasional [[manatee]]. On late spring and summer nights, [[loggerhead sea turtle]]s arrive on the beach to lay their eggs. Nests are monitored and protected by area naturalists, and guided turtle walks are available. Shrimping is still important to the region, and shrimp boats are often seen just off the beaches.  Like most barrier islands, St. Simons Island beaches are constantly shifting as tides, wind and storms move tons of sand annually. Along with umbrellas and folding chairs, beach-goers can encounter fast-moving [[ghost crab]]s, [[sand dollar]]s, giant [[horseshoe crab]]s, and moving [[conch]] shells powered by resident [[hermit crab]]s. [[Sea oats]] and [[Morning glory|morning glories]] cover the [[dune]]s along East Beach. Jumping [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]] and tiny [[bait fish]] populate the inshore waters. [[Dolphin]] sightings are common, particularly off the island’s south coast.  === St. Simons Land Trust === The St. Simons Land Trust is a [[501(c) organization|non-profit]] conservation organization dedicated to land preservation on St. Simons Island. Funded by community membership, government grants and local fund-raisers, the Land Trust seeks to acquire and/or preserve land on the island in order to maintain its character and appearance, and to educate the public on the importance and benefits of land conservation. Founded in 2000, the Land Trust had approximately 780 acres of land under its protection by 2014.<ref>Internal Revenue Service. (2014). ''Form 990: Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax''.</ref>  The St. Simons Land Trust is accredited by the Land Trust Accreditation Commission of the [[Land Trust Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Land Trust Accreditation Commission - Land Trust Accreditation Commission|url = http://www.landtrustaccreditation.org/land-trust-locator/location/1049|website = www.landtrustaccreditation.org|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}</ref>  ==== Cannon's Point Preserve ==== In September, 2012, following an 18-month fund-raising effort, the St. Simons Land Trust acquired a 608 acre tract of undeveloped land in the northeast portion of the island. The acreage includes maritime forest, [[salt marsh]], tidal creek and river shore line, as well as ancient shell [[midden]]s and remains of the John Couper plantation of the early 19th century.  The Preserve is open to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays for hiking, bicycling, bird-watching and picnicking. The Preserve also features a launch site for kayaks, canoes and paddleboards, and an observation tower at the north end.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sslt.org/pro_cpp_visit.php|title = Visit Cannon's Point Preserve|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-02|website = St. Simons Land Trust|publisher = St. Simons Land Trust, Inc.|last = |first = }}</ref>  ==Demographics== As of the [[census]] of 2010,<ref>{{Cite web|title = American FactFinder - Results|url = http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/cf/1.0/en/place/St. Simons CDP, Georgia/POPULATION/DECENNIAL_CNT|website = factfinder.census.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-21|first = U.S. Census|last = Bureau}}</ref> there were 12,743 people, 6,117 households, and 3,637 families residing in the CDP, occupying a land area of 15.94 square miles (41.28 km2). The [[population density]] was 799.4 people per square mile (308.7/km²). There were 9,931 housing units at an average density of 623.0 per square mile (240.6/km²). The racial makeup of the CDP was 94.8 percent White, 2.8 percent African American, 0.1 percent Native American, 1.0 percent Asian, 1.53 percent from other races, and 0.7 percent from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.2 percent of the population.  There were 6,117 households out of which 19.9 percent had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.0 percent were married couples living together, 7.5 percent had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.5 percent were non-families. 34.2 percent of all households were made up of individuals and 14.2 percent had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.06 and the average family size was 2.63.  In the CDP, the population was spread out with 16.4 percent under the age of 18, 4.2 percent from 18 to 24, 19.4 percent from 25 to 44, 35.1 percent from 45 to 64, and 25.0 percent who were 65 years of age or older.

The per capita income for the CDP was $50,043. About 1.9 percent of families and 3.7 percent of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.4 percent of those under age 18 and 2.9 percent of those age 65 or over.  == History ==  ===Native American history=== [[File:St Simons Park marker, St. Simons, GA, US.jpg|thumb|St. Simons Park marker]] [[File:St. Simons Park, St. Simons, GA, US.jpg|thumb|St. Simons Park]] Just north of the village on St. Simons Island off Mallery Street is a park of oak trees named St. Simons Park. On the southern edge of the oaks, along a narrow lane, is a low earthen mound where 30 Native Americans are buried. The men, women and children interred there lived in a settlement on the site two centuries before the first European contact.  The first inhabitants of St. Simons lived there during fishing season about 2,000 BCE. It is not known what they called themselves. The much later historic tribe, who encountered the Europeans, became known as the [[Timucuan]].  The tribe and its people persist. Arising from the [[prehistoric]] [[Mississippian culture]] that flourished over much of the Southeast, the eastern Timucuan had a territory ranging along the coastal plain of southeast Georgia and northern Florida. Their complex and loose confederacy was made up of seven distinct tribal groups that spoke at least five dialects of the Timucuan language.  During the early Spanish colonial period, St. Simons Island was the northern boundary of the tribal and Spanish mission province known as [[Mocama]], which extended southward to the [[St. Johns River]] in present-day Florida.  Its name was taken from that of the dialect of the people.  The town of [[San Buenaventura de Guadalquini|Guadalquini]] was located on the south end of the island at the site of the present-day lighthouse. The Spanish applied the town's name to the island as well.  === Fort Frederica === *{{main|Fort Frederica National Monument}} [[File:GA St Simons Fort Frederica NM fort02.jpg|thumb|Remains of Fort Frederica]] Fort Frederica, now [[Fort Frederica National Monument]], was built beginning in 1736 as the military headquarters of the [[Province of Georgia]] during the early English [[Colonial America|colonial period]]. It served as a buffer against [[Spain|Spanish]] incursion from [[Florida]].  Nearby is the site of the [[Battle of Gully Hole Creek]] and [[Battle of Bloody Marsh]], where on July 7, 1742, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] ambushed Spanish troops marching single file through the marsh and routed them from the island. This marked the end of the Spanish efforts to invade Georgia during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]].<ref>[http://www.glynncounty.com/cgi-bin/oaktree.pl?dbf=data.txt&ID=00001260 Fort Frederica National Monument, 6515 Frederica Road, St. Simons Island, GA 31522, Historic_Places, http://www.nps.gov/fofr/], National Park Service</ref>  It has been preserved in the 20th century and identified as a national historic site largely by the efforts of Margaret Davis Cates, a local resident who contributed much to historic preservation. She helped raise more than $100,000 in 1941 to buy the site of the fort and conduct stabilization and some preservation. It was designated as a [[National Monument]] in 1947.<ref>http://www.nps.gov/fofr/historyculture/.../cate.pdf</ref>  ==== Wesley brothers ==== [[File:Wesley Oak marker, St. Simons, GA, US.jpg|thumb|Historical marker about the Wesley Oak]] In the 1730s St. Simons served as a sometime home to [[John Wesley]], the young minister of the colony at Savannah.  He later returned to England, where in 1738 he founded the evangelical movement of [[Methodism]] within the Anglican Church. Wesley performed [[missionary]] work at St. Simons while he was still in the [[Anglican Church]], but he was despondent about failing to bring about conversions. (He wrote that the local inhabitants had more tortures from their environment than he could describe for [[Hell]]). In the 1730s John Wesley's brother [[Charles Wesley]] also did missionary work on St. Simons.<ref>[http://www.glynncounty.com/cgi-bin/oaktree.pl?dbf=data.txt&ID=00012851 Wesley Oak (historic marker), Glynn County, GA, Historical_Markers]</ref> In the late eighteenth century, Methodist preachers traveled throughout Georgia as part of the [[Great Awakening]], a religious revival movement led by Methodists and Baptists. They converted African-American slaves as well as British and European colonists.  On April 5, 1987, fifty-five members from St. Simons United Methodist Church were commissioned, with Bishop Frank Robertson as first pastor, to begin a new church on the north end of St. Simons Island. This was where John and Charles Wesley had preached and ministered to the people at [[Fort Frederica]]. The new church was named Wesley United Methodist Church at Frederica.  === American Revolution === An important naval battle in the [[American Revolution]] (the [[Frederica Naval Action]]) was won by the American Colonists near St. Simons on April 19, 1778.  Colonel [[Samuel Elbert]] was in command of Georgia's Continental Army and Navy.  On April 15, 1778 he learned that four British ships (including the ''Hinchinbrook'', the ''Rebecca'', and the ''Galatea'') from [[East Florida]] were sailing in St. Simons Sound.  Elbert commanded about 360 troops from the Georgia Continental Battalions at Fort Howe  to march to [[Darien, Georgia]].  There they boarded three Georgia Navy galleys: the ''Washington'', commanded by Captain John Hardy ; the ''Lee'', commanded by Captain John Cutler Braddock; and the ''Bulloch'', commanded by Captain Archibald Hatcher.  On April 18 they entered Frederica River and anchored about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} from [[Fort Frederica National Monument|Fort Frederica]].  On April 19 the colonial ships attacked the British [[Royal Navy]] ships.  The Colonial ships were armed with heavier cannon than the British. The galleys also had a shallow [[draft (hull)|draft]] and could be rowed.  When the wind died down, the British ships had difficulty maneuvering in the restricted waters of the river and sound.  Two of the British ships ran aground and the British escaped to their other ship.   The battle showed how effective the galleys could be in restricted waters over ships designed for the open sea.  The Frederica naval action was a big boost to the morale of the colonists in Georgia.  === Cotton production === During the [[plantation era]], Saint Simons became a center of [[cotton]] production known for its long fiber [[Sea Island Cotton]]. Nearly the entire island was cleared of trees to make way for several large cotton plantations. These were worked by African slaves and their descendants. The plantations of this and other Sea Islands were large, and often the owners stayed on the mainland in Darien and other towns, especially during the summers. This season was considered bad for diseases of the lowlands. A concentration of Africans on these islands led to the development of the [[Gullah people]], preserving more remnants of West African ethnic groups  than in areas of the Upper South, where African-American slaves were held in smaller groups and interacted more with whites. The Gullah language and culture has survived into the 21st century, although much disrupted through the 20th.  One of the last [[slave ship]]s to bring [[slaves]] from [[Africa]] docked at St. Simons Island, but the slaves threw themselves off the boat into the water, dragged down by their chains, and drowned themselves rather than submit to slavery.<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/geography-environment/st-simons-island]</ref>  An original slave cabin still stands at the intersection of Demere Rd. and Frederica Rd. at the [[roundabout]].  === The Civil War and its aftermath === During the early stages of the war, Confederate troops occupied St. Simons Island to protect its strategic location at the entrance to Brunswick harbor. However in 1862, [[Robert E. Lee|General Robert E. Lee]] ordered an evacuation of the island in order to relocate the soldiers for the defense of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. Before departing, they destroyed the lighthouse to prevent its use as a navigation aid by Union naval forces. Most property owners and their former slaves then retreated inland, and the [[Union Army|Union army]] occupied the island for the remainder of the war.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Georgia’s Land of the Golden Isles|last = Vanstory|first = Burnette|publisher = University of Georgia Press|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Athens, GA|pages = 139}}</ref>  Postwar, the island plantations were in ruins, and landowners found it financially unfeasible to cultivate cotton or rice. Most moved inland to pursue other occupations, and the island’s economy remained dormant for several years. Former slaves established a community in the center of the island known as Harrington.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Harrington Community, , ,  , Communities|url = http://www.glynncounty.com/oaktree.pl?id=00008690|website = www.glynncounty.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}</ref>  ===Lumber=== Saint Simons' first exports of [[lumber]] occurred after the [[Naval Act of 1794]], when timber harvested from two thousand Southern live oak trees from Gascoigne Bluff was used to build the ''[[USS Constitution]]'' and five other [[frigate]]s (see [[six original United States frigates]]). The ''USS Constitution'' is known as "Old Ironsides", as cannonballs bounced off its hard live oak planking.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Roads Less Traveled: Exploring America's Past on Its Back Roads|last = Wilkerson|first = Lyn|publisher = Writers Club Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 311}}</ref>  The second phase of lumber production on the island began in the late 1870’s, when mills were constructed in the area surrounding Gascoigne Bluff. The mills supported a vibrant community that lasted until just after the turn of the twentieth century. During this time, lumber from St. Simons was shipped to New York City for use in construction of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = St. Simons Island: A Summary of Its History|last = Green|first = R.

From as early as the 1870’s, summer cottages were being constructed on the south end of the island, and a small village was forming to serve them.  Construction of the pier in 1887<ref>{{Cite book|title = GLYNN COUNTY HISTORIC RESOURCES SURVEY REPORT|last = |first = |publisher = Quatrefoil Historic Preservation Consulting|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Savannah, GA|pages = 25}}</ref> brought visitors by boat from Brunswick and south Georgia.

The arrival of the automobile and the opening of the Torras Causeway in 1924 insured the continued growth of tourism on St. Simons, the only one of the [[Golden Isles of Georgia|Golden Isles]] not privately held. New hotels were built. Roads were constructed, and tourism became the dominant force in the Island’s economy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History of Saint Simons Island, Georgia, GA|url = http://www.glynncounty.com/History_and_Lore/Ed_Green/later_resort_days.shtml|website = www.glynncounty.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}</ref>[[File:GA St Simons King and Prince Hotel02.jpg|thumb|King and Prince Hotel]]On April 8, 1942, [[World War II]] became a terrifying reality to residents of St. Simons Island, when a German [[U-boat]] sank two [[oil tanker]]s in the middle of the night.

The facility was both a fortress and a small town, located on the Frederica River. In 1742, troops from the fort defeated invading Spanish forces at the Battle of Bloody Marsh, which turned out to be decisive in ending Spanish influence and securing the Georgia colony under British rule. By mid-century the troops were withdrawn and the colonists abandoned the town, which then fell into disrepair. In 1945, Fort Frederica was established as a national monument, and is currently operated by the National Park Service.  === Gascoigne Bluff === {{Main|Gascoigne Bluff}}For almost the entire history of St. Simons Island, Gascoigne Bluff has been a focal point. Long before the arrival of Europeans, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] lived and camped on the site. The Spanish also built a mission on or near the area. When General Oglethorpe and the British arrived in 1736, they established a naval facility at the bluff, and granted 500 acres of its land to Captain James Gascoigne, of the sloop-of-war ''Hawk'', and the name persists to this day. In 1794, lumber from the area was used in construction of the frigate, “Old Ironsides.” During the antebellum period of cotton farming, the bluff was the site of Hamilton plantation, of which two slave cabins remain standing today. In the late 19th century, lumber mills thrived at the scene. Today, the bluff is occupied by Epworth By The Sea, and Gascoigne Bluff Park at its southern end, with picnic tables, rest rooms, and a fishing pier.  === Lovely Lane Chapel === In 1880, Norman W. Dodge built St. James Union Church at Gascoigne Bluff to serve the lumber mill community. After the mills shut down, the building was [[Deconsecration|deconsecrated]] in the 1920s and became a social hall. When the Methodists acquired the property in 1949, they renamed it Lovely Lane Chapel. The chapel is currently open to the public for Sunday Worship Service as well as wedding ceremonies. 100 Arthur J.
