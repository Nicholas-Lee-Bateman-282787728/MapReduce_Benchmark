   U.S. Cellular Field (formerly Comiskey Park) is a baseball park in Chicago, Illinois. It is the home of the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball's American League. The park is owned by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, but operated by the White Sox.  The park opened for the 1991 season, after the White Sox had spent 81 years at the original Comiskey Park. The new park, completed at a cost of US$167 million, also opened with the Comiskey Park name, but became U.S. Cellular Field in 2003 after U.S. Cellular bought the naming rights at $68 million over 20 years.http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/white-sox/post/_/id/14560/the-cell-not-in-line-for-name-change It hosted the MLB All-Star Game that same year. Many sportscasters and fans continue to use the name Comiskey Park. Prior to its demolition, the old Comiskey Park was the oldest in-use ballpark in Major League Baseball, a title now held by Fenway Park in Boston. The current public address announcer is Gene Honda, who also serves as the PA announcer for the Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is situated just to the west of the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago's Armour Square neighborhood, adjacent to the more famous neighborhood of Bridgeport. It was built directly across 35th Street from old Comiskey Park, which was demolished to make room for a parking lot that serves the venue. Old Comiskey's home plate location is represented by a marble plaque on the sidewalk next to U.S. Cellular Field and the foul lines are painted in the parking lot. Also, the spectator ramp across 35th Street is designed in such a way (partly curved, partly straight but angling east-northeast) that it echoes the contour of the old first-base grandstand. The stadium was the first new major sporting facility built in Chicago since Chicago Stadium in 1929.  It was also the last one built before the wave of new "retro-classic" ballparks in the 1990s and 2000s. However, a few design features from the old park were retained.  The front facade of the park features arched windows.  Most notable is the "exploding scoreboard" which pays homage to the original installed by Bill Veeck at the old park in 1960. The original field dimensions and seating configuration were very similar to those of Royals Stadium (now Kauffman Stadium) in Kansas City—which had been the last baseball-only park built in the majors, in 1973.  As originally built, the park was criticized by many fans because of the height of the upper deck.  The original architect, HOK Sport (now Populous), wanted to eliminate the overhang problems present in many stadiums built since the 1970s.  With this in mind, the upper deck was set back over the lower deck, and the stands rose fairly gradually.  While it gave nearly every seat in the upper level an unobstructed view of the field, it also created one of the highest upper decks in baseball. The first row of seats in the upper deck at the new stadium is as far from the field as the highest row of seats in the upper deck at the old stadium. Fans sitting in this area didn't get much chance for relief, as it is one of the few parks in Major League Baseball that do not allow fans sitting in the upper deck to venture anywhere else in the park, e.g. lower deck concourse. In response to fan complaints, the stadium has undergone numerous renovations since the 2001 season in order to retrofit the facility to current architectural trends. These changes have included building a multi-tiered concourse beyond center field, adjusting the fences to make the outfield less symmetrical and, most significantly, the removal of 6,600 seats at the top of the upper deck. The uppermost story of the park now has a white and black screen behind the top row of seats and is topped by a flat canopy roof supported by black steel truss supports that obstruct the view of a few seats.  The original blue seats were also replaced by forest green seats. The new green and black color scheme, upper level screen set back from the outer wall and canopy roof resemble features of the old Comiskey Park as well as other classic baseball stadiums. The White Sox have also added murals to the interior concourses, a prominent feature of the old stadium. The stadium houses 103 luxury suites located on two levels, as well as 1,822 "club seats" on 300-level mezzanine between the lower deck and upper deck. The club seats receive in-seat wait-staff and benefit from an enclosed concourse with multiple television viewing areas and bar-style concessions. The stadium has 400 wheelchair-accessible seats, 38 public restrooms, 12 escalators and 15 elevators.  The new suites were one example of why the old Comiskey Park was demolished, as suites generate more revenue. In 2001, extensive renovations were started by HKS Sports & Entertainment Group to make the park more fan-friendly: Renovations added not part of the original plan. 2010 2011 2012 2016 There are 11 retired numbers on the facade of the Home Plate Club.   Note: 1994 season incomplete due to Players Strike  There were three ties, the first in the 1995 season against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. The second tie happened in the 1998 season against the Blue Jays at then Comiskey Park. The third tie took place in the 1999 season against the Twins at Comiskey Park. U.S. Cellular Field has appeared in films such as Rookie of the Year (1993), Major League II (1994), Little Big League (1994), My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), and The Ladies Man (2000). In Rookie of the Year the stadium played the role of Dodger Stadium and in Little Big League the stadium played the role of all opposing ballparks except for Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park. Commercials for the PGA Tour, Nike, Reebok and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America have been filmed at the park. U.S. Cellular, a wireless telephone company, has sponsored several sports venues: U.S. Cellular serves as the title sponsor of a NASCAR Nationwide Series race, the U.S. Cellular 250, at Iowa Speedway in Newton, Iowa. It has also served as the presenting sponsor of the 80/35 Music Festival in Des Moines, Iowa, since its inception in 2008.- 80/35 music festival          White Sox retired numbers No. Player Position White Sox years Date retired Notes 2 Nellie Fox 2B 1950–63 1976 Hall of Fame (1997) 3 Harold Baines RF, DH 1980–89, 96–97, 00–01, (coach, 04–present) 1989-08-20 Baines' number was retired after he was traded to the Texas Rangers midway through 1989.

(Visually Re-Directed Seats) The seats where Paul Konerko's Grand Slam (left field) and Scott Podsednik's walk off home run (right center first row) landed in game two of the 2005 World Series are the same original blue seats in use at that game and stand out from the all-green seats.

The beginning of the White Sox Champions brick plaza in front of the stadium (Gate 4) and Phase I of brick sales. The Illinois Sports Facilities Authority unveiled the first environmentally friendly permeable paving parking lot to be used by a Major League sports facility on April 8. The new lot (Lot L) saves taxpayer money by substantially reducing the amount of water entering Chicago's stormwater system, improving overall water quality and help reduce the Urban heat island effect. The White Sox Legacy Brick Program unveiled its brick plaza outside U.S. Cellular Field (Gate 4) on April 11. Each Legacy Brick is inscribed with a personalized message and has become part of a new baseball diamond-shaped plaza outside the main entrance to the ballpark. A life-sized white bronze and granite sculpture weighing over 25 tons that celebrates the 2005 White Sox World Series Championship stands at the center of the plaza, with a historical timeline of the franchise along the diamond's base paths. Players on the sculpture from the 2005 team are Paul Konerko, Joe Crede, Orlando Hernández, Geoff Blum and Juan Uribe. Plasma flat screen television sets were added throughout the outfield concourse and at the top of its beer concession stands. A life size bronze statue of Harold Baines that was placed on July 20 on the right field concourse behind Section 105. About $15 million in renovations were done to Gate 5 (north of 35th Street) to improve access to the park. The demolition (beginning of November 2008) of the easternmost portion of the pedestrian ramp and removal of the top two levels of the eastern-most foot bridge across 35th Street, reducing it to one level with continuing access to the park on the main concourse level. The second foot bridge at Gate 5, about  west of the east bridge, continues to offer access to the park on three levels. The project also included installation of escalators in a new, weather-protected enclosure and installation of elevators which will provide additional access for fans with disabilities. The project was completed by Opening Day on April 7 as the White Sox defeated the Kansas City Royals 4–2. Inside the park, a new scoreboard (23&nbsp;ft x 68&nbsp;ft) with 913,000 LED lights (similar to Tropicana Field) replaced the older out-of-town scoreboard in right field. In addition to displaying both lineups (that of the Sox and their opponents) the board shows season stats for the current batter and pitcher. It also serves as an upgrade to the old "around-the-league" scoreboard that it replaced. While the old scoreboard showed only the current innings, scores, and pitchers' jersey numbers, the new board is capable of showing balls, strikes, outs, locations of any baserunners, and the current batter and pitcher by last name instead of by number. A slight disadvantage is that the new board can only show four games at a time in this manner, whereas the old board showed every game in progress simultaneously. A small plaque honoring Jim Thome located on the center field fan deck for his 464-foot home run shot that landed there, becoming the first player ever to do so on June 4, 2008. The White Sox defeated the Royals in that game. Thome duplicated this feat again on September 30, 2008 in a one-game playoff against AL Central rival Minnesota Twins. His home run proved to be the game winner in a 1-0 shutout to win the AL Central. For White Sox players a new hydrotherapy room with three combinational hot-and-cold whirlpool tubs. An underwater treadmill, that can curb problems relating to the abdominals, back and knee, as well as strengthens the muscles and hip, is installed in one of the tubs. "The Catch" was written on the left-center field wall above Billy Pierce's image (now above a blank wall), at the location where DeWayne Wise made a spectacular catch to rob Gabe Kapler of a 9th-inning home run and preserve Mark Buehrle's perfect game on July 23, 2009. A new outdoor Beer Garden named "TBD's" is installed by July 26 (when the White Sox hosted the Seattle Mariners) at Gate 5. The area served beer, wine, soda and water. TBD's also had 12 flat-screen TVs. TBD's was taken down and replaced by "ChiSox Bar and Grill" in 2011. Bacardi at the Park is open from 11 AM on days when the Sox have home games. Although it is technically outside the park and accessible with or without a game ticket, fans must be 21 or older to enter. Frank Thomas' number and picture was added to the outfield wall as his number was retired. A new Metra station (Jones/Bronzeville) on the Rock Island line (designed by Infrastructure Engineering, Inc.) worth $7.9 million was planned to be opened in 2009, but due to a year-long delay of construction the station opened in 2011 after groundbreaking on June 29, 2009. The new station is located East of the ballpark just beyond the I-90/I-94 Dan Ryan Expressway. A multi-level restaurant and bar inside Gate 5 called "ChiSox Bar and Grill" (formerly known as Bacardi at the Park).  The establishment features both indoor and outdoor seating and a wide variety of food, drinks, and entertainment for U.S. Cellular Field guests that started in April 2011. "ChiSox Bar and Grill" will be open during the baseball season, but plans made the restaurant and bar a year-round establishment. A life-size bronze statue of Frank Thomas that was unveiled on July 31, against the Boston Red Sox. It is the 8th placed on the outfield concourse. Chicago Sports Depot, a new merchandise store located right next to Gate 5 and ChiSox Bar and Grill. Featuring White Sox, Bears, Blackhawks, Bulls, Cubs, and other Chicago area sports teams merchandise. The store opened on November 19, 2011. Three new HD video boards will be installed in the ballpark in time for the 2016 season. The auxiliary boards in left and right field, and the main video board in center, will all be replaced with new HD screens. The project will be funded via the Sox' capital repairs budget.
