Roselle Park has a rich railroading heritage. A steam locomotive adorns the Borough seal, and the town is very welcoming to railroad enthusiasts. The Elizabethtown & Somerville railway began laying rails through what would become Roselle Park in 1839. It eventually became the Central Railroad of New Jersey between Jersey City, New Jersey and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Throughout the years as traffic grew, the line would grow to four main tracks, and also offered trains of Reading Company and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Roselle Park and Roselle formerly shared a rail station on the CNJ mainline. Passenger service east of Bayonne ended on April 30, 1967. Shuttle service between Bayonne and Cranford continued on until August 1978 but eventually ended, resulting in the closure of the old station on Chestnut Street.Frassinelli, Mike. "NJ Transit opens Bayonne 8th Street Station, extending Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service", The Star-Ledger, January 31, 2011. Accessed September 3, 2013. "Bayonne Mayor Mark Smith was in high school when that part of downtown Bayonne waved goodbye to train service nearly 33 years ago. 'The last time a train rolled out of here was in August of 1978, headed for Cranford and points west,' he said. For 113 years previously, Smith said, Bayonne had been part of the reliable Jersey Central railroad system that linked the state." The line continued to see operation as an access route to the NJTransit/NJDOT railroad shops at Elizabethport until the mid-1980s. It is currently out of service and unused, as the Conrail Elizabeth Industrial Track. Competition would come as the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company realized that railroading was a more efficient mode of transportation for their coal than a canal system. They formed the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and began building Eastward in 1853. By 1872, they had reached Roselle, and formed the subsidiary Newark and Roselle Railway in order to continue building East to the Hudson River. April 1, 1976 the Lehigh Valley Railroad became part of the Consolidated Rail Corporation, also known as Conrail and became known as their "Lehigh Line". On June 1, 2001, Conrail was purchased and split between Norfolk Southern (60%) and CSX (40%), and became "shared assets". Conrail continues to operate the Lehigh Line between Newark and Manville for Norfolk Southern and CSX. In addition to New Jersey Transit the line sees anywhere from 35-45 freights per day from three railroads; Conrail, Norfolk Southern, and CSX. Canadian Pacific (formerly Delaware and Hudson Railway) utilized trackage rights into Oak Island Yard in Newark until 2012. The track is Norfolk Southern's primary access on their northern transcontinental route into and out of the New York City metropolitan area, and is also part of CSX's primary North-South corridor between New England and Jacksonville, Florida. The Roselle Park train station offers New Jersey Transit commuter rail service as part of their Raritan Valley Line service. This was a result of the Aldene Connection in Roselle Park between tracks of the Central Railroad and Lehigh Valley Railroad, which opened April 30, 1967, allowing passengers to travel directly to Newark Penn Station and change there for trains to New York Penn Station, rarther than traveling to the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal in Jersey City and taking ferries into Manhattan.Burks, Edward C.
