The earliest inhabitants of present-day Ewing Township in the historic era were Lenni Lenape Native Americans, who lived along the banks of the Delaware River. Their pre-colonial subsistence activities in the area included hunting, fishing, pottery-making, and simple farming. Europeans, mostly from the British Isles, began to colonize the area in the 17th and 18th centuries. One of the earliest European settlers was William Green, and his 1717 farmhouse still stands on the campus of The College of New Jersey.About the Farmhouse, Friends of the Wm Green Farmhouse.
