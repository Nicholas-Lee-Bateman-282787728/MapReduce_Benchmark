 The SEAT León () is a hatchback small family car built by the Spanish car manufacturer SEAT since October 1998.ETKA The first two León generations used two differing variants of the Volkswagen Group A platform, and shared many components with other Volkswagen Group cars. The third generation uses the Volkswagen Group MQB platform, also used by the Audi A3 Mk3, Volkswagen Golf Mk7 and Škoda Octavia Mk3.    The initial SEAT León (Volkswagen Group Typ 1M), launched in 1999, available only as hatchback, and the related saloon version was known as the SEAT Toledo.  It was based on the Volkswagen Group A4 (PQ34) platform and, as such, shared many components in common with other VW Group models such as the Volkswagen Golf Mk4, Bora and Audi A3.  As SEAT's first C-segment model as part of the VW Group, the León Mk1 was marketed as a sportier and cheaper variant of the Golf.  To reinforce the sporty image, the vehicle had slightly more aggressive looks.  The more expensive versions were equipped with relatively more powerful internal combustion engines, along with firmer suspension to improve handling.  In the interior, the dashboard was derived from that of the first-generation Audi A3.The cabin is, among others, borrowed from Audi A3 http://www.autozine.org/Graveyard/html/Seat/Toledo.html  Available engines were the 1.4&nbsp;litre 16&nbsp;valve petrol engine which produced a , a 1.6&nbsp;litre 8&nbsp;valve petrol engine  (replaced later with a 16&nbsp;valve  unit), and included two variants of the Volkswagen Group's 20&nbsp;valve turbocharged 1.8&nbsp;litre powerplant, (with some countries also getting the 2.8&nbsp;litre VR6 engine delivering . The original "León 20VT" (which later became known as the "Cupra" and then the "FR") had a 1.8&nbsp;litre Turbo with , and the "León Cupra R" , later becoming . It became first available in only three body paints (red, yellow, black),  picked as an homage to the colors of both Spain's and Germany's national flags referring back to the roots of the joint project the model originally was. In some countries, there was also a "Cupra 4"; equipped with a 2.8&nbsp;litre VR6 delivering  and equipped with four-wheel drive (4WD), based on the same Haldex Traction multi-plate clutch as the Volkswagen Golf 4motion.  A range of Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engines was available, including a  version of Volkswagen Group's 1.9&nbsp;TDI engine, originally sold as a "Cupra 4 TDI", with 4WD, that was sold for one year only, and only in certain countries, then passed to "Evolution" series, then "Top Sport", and later rebranded as the "FR" ('Formula Racing'). In other countries the model was badged "Cupra" and then "FR" before a limited number of cars were fitted with the bodykit from the petrol powered "Cupra R" and named the "FR+". Lesser diesel versions were available with ,  and  outputs.  All engines over  have a standard six-speed manual transmission. Rear suspension was by semi-independent torsion beam for most variants, whilst high-end and 4WD models were fitted with a multi-link independent rear suspension.  All versions came with disc brakes on all four roadwheels (the front ventilated, and in some cars the rear too).  In Mexico, the León became a very popular car with upper class young people.  The only problem the León has suffered in Mexico is the fact that the sport tuned suspension of the León is not designed to withstand the constant road imperfections such as potholes and speed bumps that abound in Mexican roads. In Switzerland, there was another official version tuned by Abt Sportsline of the León called "SEAT León Cupra 4 Kompressor".  This version had the same 4WD and 2.8&nbsp;litre VR6 but with  and  of torque. Factory production of the Typ 1M ended in May 2006.  However, the appreciation for the SEAT León Cupra R Mk1's appeal remained clear, still up to the 'best hot hatchback of all time' poll, conducted in 2010 by Autocar, in which its readers honoured the Cupra R #7, in the top ten list of hatchbacks of all time in their preferences.The best hot hatch ever – result http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/250361/ The Typ 1M SEAT León was available with the following internal combustion engines, with most being shared from other marques of the Volkswagen Group:    The second generation León, Typ 1P, was released in 2005, with factory production commencing May 2005.  It is based on the Volkswagen Group A5 (PQ35) platform, most notably used by the Volkswagen Golf Mk5.  It is built in Spain, and has a sharper exterior look with vertically parked windscreen wipers, and the external rear door handles more integrated, in a similar style to that seen on recent Alfa Romeo models.  Design was handled by Walter de'Silva, and the car uses the same design style that started with the SEAT Altea. The base model on offer is the new 16&nbsp;valve 1.2&nbsp;litre TSI petrol engine with .New 1.2 TSI engines for Leon|http://media.seat.com/en/seat-news/581-nuevas-motorizaciones-en-la-gama-leon-y-altea.html/  In some markets (e.g. Greece, Romania and Italy), the León is available with a 1.4&nbsp;litre MPI engine producing .  The sportier variants begin with the  2.0&nbsp;litre Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) and the popular  2.0&nbsp;litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine.  Both are fitted with a standard six-speed manual transmission, with the six-speed or seven-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) available as an option.  A  variant of the 2.0&nbsp;TFSI unique to the León was later introduced, but despite a low list price and rapid performance – attracted only minimal attention and average reviews, so this was later discontinued to make way for the sportier FR variants. The first real sporty León within the new range is the León FR with twin-exhaust pipes to left rear, sport seats and gear stick with FR logo to distinguish it from lesser models, was introduced in June 2006, when it finally received the  2.0&nbsp;TFSI engine from the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 GTI, as well as a  variant of the 2.0&nbsp;TDI unit featured in the Golf and Audi A3.  Further standard equipment includes climate control air conditioning. Next in the range is the 2.0&nbsp;TFSI Cupra model.  It features a  engine, and a 0- time of 6.4&nbsp;seconds.  The Cupra comes with standard 18" 5 twin-spoke alloys, red brake calipers, and the standard Cupra oval exhaust, as well as new, unique paint finishes and bolstered sport seats complete with the Cupra logo.  Also standard are drilled-aluminium sports pedals.   At the top of the range is the 2.0 TFSI Cupra R.  This uses the same  engine found in the Audi S3, Golf R and Scirocco R.  Capable of 0– in 6.2 seconds and a top speed limited to . From 2008, the K1 variant of the León Cupra was introduced in the UK, featuring extensively re-worked front and rear bumpers, side skirts, a more pronounced tailgate spoiler.  It also gained a unique chrome-tipped, centrally-mounted, oval exhaust.  The K1 is considered to be a limited edition model, as production was only for the year 2008–2009 and it only being available in the UK. In 2009, the SEAT León Cupra was turned into a race car in the 'SEAT Cupra race' mobile game for Apple iPhone/iPod touch available through the iTunes' App store.The SEAT León CUPRA joins the SEAT CUPRA Race http://media.seat.com/en/seat-news/2009/506-seat-cupra-race-ahora-con-el-seat-leon-cupra.html  In 2008, SEAT Deutschland announced the production of 55 units of the SEAT León Copa Edition.

SEAT has produced two versions of the Twin Drive prototype. Initially announced in May 2009SEAT presents its electric car project to Spanish government http://media.seat.com/en/seat-news/2009/291-seat-presenta-al-gobierno-espanol-su-proyecto-hacia-el-coche-electrico.html as a diesel/battery hybrid, the León Twin Drive Ecomotive is a series plug-in hybrid, powered by an electric motor, through lithium-ion batteries chargeable at a regular electrical socket, in combination with a diesel-powered internal combustion engine.SEAT IBE concept and Leon Twin drive|http://media.seat.com/en/salones/571-un-deportivo-para-la-era-electrica.html  The Twin Drive Ecomotive project is a first step towards a 100% electric car and is planned to go for production in 2014. The Twin Drive Ecomotive as a plug-in hybrid vehicle powered through the combination of both a diesel engine and an electric motor. The vehicle's electric motor has an output of 35 KW and a self-imposed top speed of 100&nbsp;km/h, and resumes power from Li-ion batteries placed at the rear of the vehicle, giving it a range of about 50&nbsp;km for short urban circuits, while for longer trips the environmentally friendly tuned combustion engine is used. Quick battery recharging process from the mains through regular power sockets features.SEAT celebrates 60 years http://media.seat.com/en/company/60th-anniversary/609-seat-cumple-60-anos.html In 2011, a revised version of the Twin Drive was shown to the press, with a 1.4TSI petrol engine producing  in addition to a  generator and an electric motor of , producing a combined limited output of  and emitting a low 39g/km of CO2, with production now estimated in 2015.

The first official information and pictures of the car were released in July 16, 2012, while it got its public debut only a few months later, at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, in September. That makes Leon the second car to be based on the MQB platform. It features new safety equipment, such as driver knee airbag, and a number of new safety systems, including (often as standard) a multi-collision braking system to automatically brake the car after an accident in order to avoid a second collision, a lane-keeping assistant, and driver fatigue detection. The braking system includes a hill-start assistant. In the interior, there is a driver-oriented centre console hosting a 5.8-inch touch-screen infotainment display with some models featuring a proximity sensor, also used in the Volkswagen Golf, as well as ambient lighting. A new feature available for the first time in its class are the optional full-LED headlamps combined with a full beam assistant. The full-LED headlamps offer numerous advantages over standard halogen bulbs such as improved illumination, a close to daylight colour temperature, lower energy consumption and an extended service life. The front fog lights can include a cornering feature. The higher specification also have a new "SEAT Drive Profile" system which allows the driver to choose between four different driving settings: eco, normal, sport, and an individual setting. This system controls the behaviour of the engine, steering, and DSG gearbox. Additionally, the 1.8 TSI 180PS and 2.0 TDI 184PS engine-equipped models will vary their engine sound via a sound actuator, as well as their interior ambient lighting between white (normal, eco and individual) and red (sport). SEAT announced in early 2012 that the range will include for the first time three-door and estate models in addition to a five-door. In September 2013, SEAT officially unveiled the Leon ST (estate model) at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The Leon ST extends the Leon's maximum load capacity to 1470 litres and is available in Europe in three different versions and eleven different engine options. On 23 June 2014, SEAT revealed an off-road version of the Léon ST called the X-PERIENCE. In March 2014, Auto Express reported that SEAT were working on an family of SUVs, with an estimated release date of 2016. The vehicles will be based on the León, and are inspired by the Nissan Qashqai, and will rival it. In 2012, the SEAT León Mk3 was tested for its safety performance under the Euro NCAP assessment scheme and it achieved a 5-star overall rating: The SEAT Leon CONNECT is a special edition model that was released in 2015. It is equipped with SEAT’s Full Link Technology and a Samsung Galaxy A3 smartphone. This technology allows the user’s phone to be connected to the car’s infotainment system and gives the user access to all the features of the SEAT ConnectApp. The SEAT Leon CONNECT has a range of exterior body colours that allow the mirrors and wheels to be customised. Interior details, including stitching are in Blue.

An "International Masters" final, featuring the best four drivers from each national series, was introduced in October 2005, as a support race for the Spanish GT Championship's final round at Montmeló.  A TDI-powered version has raced in the ECTS, an Italian-based endurance series for touring cars.  During 2005, SEAT introduced the second generation León into the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) to replace the Toledo Cupra which it had raced in the early rounds of the title.  The car features several modifications, including a racing engine that develops over , a Hewland sequential-shift gearbox (unrelated to the DSG), and an aerodynamic package for increased downforce (with its hatchback shape, the León is disavantaged against conventional three-box saloons).  Minimum weight is  with driver.  SEAT Sport, in partnership with Oreca, runs six cars in the WTCC.  Two other cars are run by SEAT Sport UK (Northern South) based in Northampton, UK in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC).  A further two cars are run by SEAT Sport Italia in the Italia Superturismo Championship. In 2006, the Supercopa León was replaced by the new shape León.
