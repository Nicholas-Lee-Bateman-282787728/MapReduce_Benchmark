 The Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) is a collegiate athletic conference which operates in the states of Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and in Oklahoma. The conference was formerly known as the Missouri Intercollegiate Athletic Association, but changed its name in 1992, after it expanded into Kansas. The conference participates in the NCAA Division II level. The MIAA currently sponsors 16 sports; eight men's and eight women's. MIAA schools with additional sports (swimming and men's soccer) usually compete independently or as part of a nearby conference. The current staff consists of Bob Boerigter (Commissioner), Larry House (Assistant Commissioner for Championships and Business Development), Amber Feldman (Associate Commissioner for Compliance and Internal Operations/Senior Woman Administrator) and Josh Slaughter (Director of Communications). On July 1, 1992, the MIAA entered a new era when the conference changed its name from the Missouri Intercollegiate Athletic Association to the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association. The name change originated in 1989, when Pittsburg State University and Washburn University became the first schools outside the state of Missouri to gain membership in the MIAA. The MIAA was established in 1912 with 14 member institutions. It included the five state teachers colleges in Missouri – Warrensburg Teachers College (now the University of Central Missouri), Northeast Missouri State Teachers College (now Truman State University), Northwest Missouri State Teacher's College (now Northwest Missouri State University), Missouri State Normal School of the Third District (now Southeast Missouri State University and Southwest Missouri State Teacher's College (now Missouri State University). It also included nine private schools — Central Methodist University, Central Wesleyan College, Culver–Stockton College, Drury University, Missouri Valley College, Missouri Wesleyan College, Tarkio College, Westminster College, and William Jewell College Only UCM and Northwest Missouri State remain members in the MIAA. In 1924 it reorganized to include only public schools, and conference records tend to begin with that date. The schools left behind in the reorganization went on to later form the Missouri College Athletic Union, which would in time become the current Heart of America Athletic Conference in the NAIA. Three schools joined the membership over the next 56 years: the Missouri School of Mines, (later the University of Missouri-Rolla and now the Missouri University of Science & Technology) in 1935, Lincoln University in 1970, and the University of Missouri-St. Louis in 1980. In 1986, Southwest Baptist University brought the conference membership back to eight schools. In 1989, Pittsburg State, Washburn, Missouri Southern State College and Missouri Western State College – formerly members of the Central States Intercollegiate Conference – began competition in the 1989-90 season. Southeast Missouri State left the MIAA following the 1990-91 season to move on to NCAA Division I, and was replaced by Emporia State University in the 1991-92 season. Missouri-St. Louis left the MIAA in 1996, as did Missouri-Rolla in 2005. Lincoln forfeited membership in 1999. Fort Hays State University joined the MIAA in 2006 and the University of Nebraska-Omaha entered the league in 2008. On July 3, 2007, Southwest Baptist University was granted independent status for their football team, while all remaining teams will stay in the MIAA.SBU opts out of football On July 8, 2009, the MIAA CEO Council voted to remain a 12-team league for the foreseeable future, denying an application by Rockhurst University (which does not have a football team but wanted to compete in other sports). The vote ended short term speculation about the League expanding to 16 teams divided into two divisions.  Lincoln re-joined the conference in 2010 and in that same year, the MIAA CEO Council voted to extend invitations to the University of Central Oklahoma and Northeastern State University to become members of the league beginning in 2012-13, as well as the University of Nebraska at Kearney and Lindenwood University. On July 30, 2010 the MIAA announced that the University of Central Oklahoma and Northeastern State University would join after leaving the Lone Star Conference at the end of the 2012–13 season. Both Lindenwood University and Nebraska–Kearney were also accepted. In 2012, the schools started to only play each other in football and play no non-conference games. At first, the teams that were closest geographically played each other every year and would rotate through the other conference members in other years. The move to expand the league was spurred at least in part after Northwest Missouri during its national championship game run had problems finding non-conference teams that would play it resulting in 2010 with it having 10-game rather than 11-game schedule. In 2011, Nebraska–Omaha joined The Summit League and moved to Division I after the 2010–11 season. As Nebraska Omaha departed in 2011, the membership of the MIAA downsized to 11. UCO, NESU, UNK and Lindenwood all joined in 2012-13, pushing the membership to 15. The league returned to 14 institutions when Truman left in 2013 to join the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC). Southwest Baptist rejoined the MIAA in football for the 2013 football season, which meant that the schools would then play an 11-game conference football schedule with no non-conference games. At the time, only schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) were allowed to schedule 12 regular-season games in all seasons. Football Championship Subdivision (formerly I-AA) schools are allowed to schedule 12 games in years that contain 14 Saturdays in the period starting with Labor Day weekend and ending with the Saturday before Thanksgiving; this started in the 2013 season. In 2014, Southwest Baptist and Lincoln started competing in the GLVC for football only. This puts it so that all of the football schools in the MIAA can play each other now, instead of rotating. In 1981, the MIAA appointed its first full-time commissioner, Ken Jones, in July. He held the position for 16 years, retiring in 1997. Former Gulf South and Metro commissioner Ralph McFillen succeeded Jones, serving 10 years before retiring in 2007. Jim Johnson then succeeded McFillen in July 2007 and served as commissioner until September 2010. Dr. Bob Boerigter succeeded Johnson in September 2010 as the commissioner for the MIAA. When the conference was created it consisted of private and public schools. In 1924 it reorganized to include only public schools, and conference records tend to begin with that date. The schools left behind in the reorganization went on to later form the Missouri College Athletic Union, which would in time become the current Heart of America Athletic Conference in the NAIA. Lincoln University was removed from the conference in 1999 because it did not have a football program since 1989. Lincoln has since reinstated its football program.Lincoln returns to MIAA  - St. Joseph News-Press - February 2, 2009  DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:1912 till:2024 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:5 left:5 bottom:50 top:5 Colors = id:line value:black  id:Full value:rgb(0.7,0.9,0.8) # all sports  id:FullxF value:rgb(0.9,0.8,0.7) # non-football  id:AssocF value:rgb(0.9,0.7,0.8) # football-only  id:AssocOS value:rgb(0.8,0.9,0.7) # associate  PlotData = width:15 textcolor:darkblue shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s   bar:1 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Central Missouri (1912–present)  bar:1 color:Full from:1924 till:1943  bar:1 color:Full from:1946 till:end   bar:2 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Truman (1912–2013)  bar:2 color:Full from:1924 till:1942  bar:2 color:FullxF from:1942 till:1943  bar:2 color:Full from:1946 till:2013  bar:2 color:AssocOS from:2013 till:2014 text:(2013–2014)   bar:3 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Northwest Missouri State (1912–present)  bar:3 color:Full from:1924 till:1943  bar:3 color:Full from:1946 till:end   bar:4 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Southeast Missouri State (1912–1991)  bar:4 color:Full from:1924 till:1929  bar:4 color:FullxF from:1929 till:1931  bar:4 color:Full from:1931 till:1943  bar:4 color:Full from:1946 till:1991   bar:5 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Southwest Missouri State (1912–1981)  bar:5 color:Full from:1924 till:1943  bar:5 color:Full from:1946 till:1981   bar:6 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Central Methodist (1912–1924)   bar:7 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Central Wesleyan (1912–1924)   bar:8 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Culver–Stockton (1912–1924)   bar:9 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Drury (1912–1924)   bar:10 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Missouri Valley (1912–1924)   bar:11 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Missouri Wesleyan (1912–1924)   bar:12 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Tarkio (1912–1924)   bar:13 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:Westminster (MO) (1912–1924)   bar:14 color:FullxF from:1912 till:1924 text:William Jewell (1912–1924)   bar:15 color:Full from:1935 till:1943 text:Missouri S&T (1935–2005)  bar:15 color:Full from:1946 till:2005   bar:16 color:Full from:1970 till:1989 text:Lincoln (1970–1999)  bar:16 color:FullxF from:1989 till:1999  bar:16 color:Full from:2010 till:2014 text:(2010–present)  bar:16 color:FullxF from:2014 till:end   bar:17 color:FullxF from:1980 till:1996 text:Missouri–St. Louis (1980–1996)   bar:18 color:FullxF from:1986 till:1987 text:Southwest Baptist (1986–present)  bar:18 color:Full from:1987 till:2007  bar:18 color:FullxF from:2007 till:2013  bar:18 color:Full from:2013 till:2014  bar:18 color:FullxF from:2014 till:end   bar:19 color:Full from:1989 till:end text:Missouri Southern (1989–present)   bar:20 color:Full from:1989 till:end text:Missouri Western (1989–present)   bar:21 color:Full from:1989 till:end text:Pittsburg State (1989–present)   bar:22 color:Full from:1989 till:end text:Washburn (1989–present)   bar:23 color:Full from:1991 till:end text:Emporia State (1991–present)   bar:24 shift:(-25) color:Full from:2006 till:end text:Fort Hays State (2006–present)   bar:25 shift:(-40) color:Full from:2008 till:2011 text:Nebraska–Omaha (2008–2011)   bar:26 shift:(-75) color:Full from:2012 till:end text:Central Oklahoma (2012–present)   bar:27 shift:(-50) color:Full from:2012 till:end text:Lindenwood (2012–present)   bar:28 shift:(-85) color:Full from:2012 till:end text:Nebraska–Kearney (2012–present)   bar:29 shift:(-80) color:Full from:2012 till:end text:Northeastern State (2012–present)   bar:30 shift:(-15) color:AssocOS from:2012 till:2015 text:Harding (2012–2015)   bar:31 shift:(-70) color:AssocOS from:2012 till:2015 text:Southern Nazarene (2012–2015)   bar:32 shift:(-45) color:AssocOS from:2012 till:end text:Upper Iowa (2012–present)   bar:33 shift:(-40) color:AssocOS from:2013 till:end text:Newman (2013–present)   bar:N color:yelloworange from:1912 till:1992 text:Missouri Intercollegiate Athletic Association  bar:N shift:(1) color:yellow2 from:1992 till:end text:Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association  ScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:10 start:1913 TextData = fontsize:L  textcolor:black  pos:(0,25) tabs:(400-center)  text:^"Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association Membership History"     The Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association sponsors championship competition in ten men's and nine women's NCAA sanctioned sports.
