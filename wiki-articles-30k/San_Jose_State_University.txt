What is now San José State University was originally established in 1857 as the Minns' Evening Normal School in San Francisco. The school was founded by George W. Minns.  In 1862, by act of the California legislature, Minns' Evening Normal School became the California State Normal School and graduated 54 women from a three-year program. The school eventually moved to San Jose in 1871, and was given Washington Square Park at Fourth and San Carlos Streets, where the campus remains to this day. In 1881, a large bell was forged to commemorate the school. The bell was inscribed with the words "California State Normal School, A.D. 1881," and would sound on special occasions until 1946 when the college obtained new chimes. The original bell appears on the SJSU campus to this day, and is still associated with various student traditions and rituals. In August 1882, a southern branch campus of the California State Normal School opened in Los Angeles, which later became the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The southern branch campus would remain under administrative control of the San Jose campus until 1919, when by act of the California state legislature the campus became the second campus of the University of California and was renamed the Southern Branch of the University of California.UCLA Library Special Collections / University Archives Home Page. Web.archive.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-09. In 1921, the California State Normal School changed its name to the State Teachers College at San Jose. In 1935, the State Teachers Colleges became the California State Colleges, and the school's name was changed again, this time to San Jose State College. In 1972, upon meeting criteria established by the Board of Trustees and the Coordinating Council for Higher Education, SJSC was granted university status, and the name was changed to California State University, San Jose. Finally, in 1974, the California legislature voted to change the school's name to San José State University.   Principals (1857-1899):   Presidents (1900–present):    The SJSU main campus comprises approximately 55 buildings situated on a rectangular, area in downtown San Jose. The campus is bordered by San Fernando Street to the north, San Salvador Street to the south, South 4th Street to the west, and South 10th Street to the east. The south campus, which is home to many of the school's athletics facilities, is located approximately  south of the main campus on South 7th Street. California State Normal School did not receive a permanent home until it moved from San Francisco to San Jose in 1871. The original California State Normal School campus in San Jose consisted of several rectangular, wooden buildings with a central grass quadrangle. The wooden buildings were destroyed by fire in 1880 and were replaced by interconnected stone and masonry structures of roughly the same configuration in 1881. These buildings were declared unsafe following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and were being torn down when an aftershock of the magnitude that was predicted to destroy the buildings occurred and no damage was observed. Accordingly, demolition was stopped, and the portions of the buildings still standing were made into four halls: Tower Hall, Morris Dailey Auditorium, Washington Square Hall, and Dwight Bentel Hall. These four structures remain standing to this day, and are the oldest buildings on campus. Beginning in the fall of 1994, the on-campus segments of San Carlos Street, Seventh Street and Ninth Street were closed to automobile traffic and converted to pedestrian walkways and green belts within the campus. San Carlos Street was renamed Paseo San Carlos, Seventh Street became El Paseo de César Chávez, and Ninth Street is now called the Ninth Street Plaza. The project was completed in 1996. Completed in 1999, the Business Classroom Project was a $16 million renovation of the James F. Boccardo Business Education Center. Completed in 1999, the $1.5 million Heritage Gateway project was unveiled. The privately funded project featured construction of eight oversized gateways around the main campus perimeter. In the fall of 2000, the SJSU Police Department, which is part of the larger California State University Police Department, opened a new on-campus, multi-level facility on 7th Street. The $177 million Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library, which opened its doors on August 1, 2003, won the Library Journal's 2004 Library of the Year award, the publication’s highest honor. The King Library represents the first collaboration of its kind between a university and a major U.S. city. The library is eight stories high, has  of floor space, and houses approximately 1.3 million volumes. San Jose's first public library occupied the same site from 1901 to 1936, and SJSU's Wahlquist Library occupied the site from 1961 to 2000. In 2006, a $2 million renovation of Tower Hall was completed. Tower Hall (California Historical Landmarks in Santa Clara County, California No. 417) is the oldest and most recognizable building on campus. It was dedicated in 1910 after previous campus structures were destroyed in the 1906 earthquake. Tower Hall, along with Morris Dailey Auditorium, Washington Square Hall, and Dwight Bentel Hall are the four oldest buildings on campus.

Fall Freshman Statistics   Admission to SJSU is based on a combination of the applicant's high school cumulative grade point average (GPA) and standardized test scores. These factors are used to determine the applicant's California State University (CSU) eligibility index. More specifically, the eligibility index is a weighted combination of high school grade point average during the final three years of high school and a score on either the SAT or ACT. The CSU eligibility index is calculated by using either the SAT or ACT as follows: :(Sum of SAT scores in mathematics and critical reading) + (800 x high school GPA) or (10 x ACT composite score without the writing score) + (200 x high school GPA) For Fall 2014, a total of 29,734 first-time, first-year (Freshmen) applications were submitted. A total of 17,793 applicants were accepted (59.8%), with 3,486 enrolling. Among first-time, first-year (Freshmen) students who enrolled in fall 2014, SAT scores for the middle 50% ranged from 450-600 for critical reading, 450-600 for math, and 440-560 for writing. ACT composite scores for the middle 50% ranged from 18–27.  The average high school GPA for incoming freshmen was 3.38. In recent years, enrollment at SJSU has become impacted in all undergraduate majors, which means the university no longer has the enrollment capacity to accept all CSU-eligible applicants, including some from local high schools and community colleges. Although an applicant may meet the minimum CSU admission requirements, CSU-eligible applicants are no longer guaranteed admission.http://www.sjsu.edu/getinvolved/orientation/Fall%202013%20Admissions.pdfhttp://www.calstate.edu/sas/documents/impactedprogramsmatrix.pdf The university maintains a cross-enrollment agreement with National Hispanic University.

Alumni also have won medals in swimming, judo and boxing. The track team coached by "Bud" Winter earned San Jose the nickname "Speed City," and produced Olympic medalists and social activists Lee Evans, John Carlos and Tommie Smith. Smith and Carlos are perhaps best remembered for giving the raised fist salute from the medalist's podium during the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. After an 11-2 finish in 2012, SJSU's football team achieved its first-ever BCS ranking and first national ranking since 1990. SJSU was ranked #21 in both the 2012 post-season Associated Press Poll and the USA Today Coaches' Poll. A heated debate was held in 1925 over the effort of some students to change the school colors from gold and white to purple and white. Tradition won out, and it was decided to keep the original colors—gold and white. This same issue came before the students again in 1946, when after many weeks of discussion the question was put to another vote. Once again, tradition won. Each year during the fall semester SJSU hosts a series of events where students can watch films at the Campus MovieFest Finale and show school pride at the Fire on the Fountain leading up to the homecoming football game at Spartan Stadium.

In 1930, the Justice Studies Department was founded as a two-year police science degree program. It holds the distinction of offering the first policing degree in the United States. A stone monument and plaque are displayed close to the site of the original Police School near Tower Hall. In 1942, the old gym (now named Yoshihiro Uchida Hall, after SJSU judo coach Yosh Uchida) was used to register and collect Japanese Americans before sending them to internment camps. Coincidentally, Uchida's parents and siblings were among those processed in the building. In 1963, in an effort to save Tower Hall from demolition, SJSU students and alumni organized testimonials before the State College Board of Trustees, sent telegrams, and provided signed petitions. As a result of those efforts, the Tower, a prime campus landmark and SJSU icon, was refurbished and reopened in 1966. The Tower was again renovated and restored in 2007. Tower Hall is registered with the California Office of Historic Preservation. During the 1960s and early 1970s, San Jose State College witnessed a rise in political activism and civic awareness among its student body, including major student protests against the Vietnam War. One of the largest campus protests took place in 1967 when Dow Chemical Company - a major manufacturer of napalm used in the war - came to campus to conduct job recruiting. An estimated 3,000 students and bystanders surrounded the Seventh Street Administration building, and more than 200 students and teachers lay down on the ground in front of the recruiters. In 1972–1973, the economics department experienced political turmoil as the administration conducted a purge of left-leaning professors. For several years thereafter, the economics department was under censor by the American Association of University Professors. In 1982 the English department began sponsoring the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest. In 1999, San Jose State and the City of San Jose agreed to combine their main libraries to form a joint city-university library located on campus, the first known collaboration of this type in the United States. The combined library faced opposition, with critics stating the two libraries have very different objectives and that the project would be too expensive. Despite opposition, the $177 million project proceeded, and the new Martin Luther King, Jr. Library opened on-time and on-budget in 2003. The new library has won several national awards since its initial opening. During its 2006-2007 fiscal year, SJSU received a record $50+ million in private gifts and $84 million in capital campaign contributions. In 2007, SJSU president Don Kassing launched SJSU's first-ever comprehensive capital fundraising campaign dubbed "Acceleration: the Campaign for San Jose State University." The original goal of the multi-year campaign was to raise $150 million, but was later increased to $200 million because of the rapid success of the campaign. The campaign would eventually exceed its goal one year earlier than anticipated, raising more than $208 million by August 2013. In 2008, SJSU received a CASE WealthEngine Award in recognition of raising over $100 million. SJSU was one of approximately 50 institutions nationwide honored by CASE in 2008 for overall performance in educational fundraising. In 2012, the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, awarded SJSU $73.3 million to participate in the development of systems for improving the safety and efficiency of air and space travel. NASA scientists, along with SJSU faculty members and graduate students, will collaborate on this effort, funded by the largest federal award in SJSU history. George W.

The Bricks offer smaller living-learning environments for up to 250 residents each.  The Bricks are: Hoover Hall, Royce Hall, and Washburn Hall. Joe West, also referred to as a "Classic," is a 12-story residence hall reserved for first-year freshmen and sophomore students. This hall houses a total of 650 students. In 2002, three of SJSU's six red brick residence halls were demolished and replaced with the new Campus Village residence complex. The $200 million housing facility comprises three buildings ranging from seven to 15 stories tall. The project increased student capacity for on-campus housing to roughly 3,500, and provides housing options for first-year students, non-freshmen, upper-classmen, graduate students, faculty, staff and guests of the university. Campus Village officially opened in 2005. The facility also includes a two-story underground parking garage for on-campus residents. Construction of a new 850-bed student residence hall is currently underway as of June 2014. The building is part of the new Campus Village (Phase 2) construction project. The new on-campus structure will be located near the intersection of 9th Street and Paseo de San Carlos. It is expected to be a 10-story high rise building with a projected cost of $126 million. The project will increase total on-campus housing capacity to 4,350. The project is scheduled to be completed in July 2016.
