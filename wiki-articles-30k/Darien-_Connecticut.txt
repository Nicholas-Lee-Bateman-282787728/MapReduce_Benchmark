  Darien is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. A relatively small community on Connecticut's "Gold Coast", the population was 20,732 at the 2010 census. Darien is one of the wealthiest communities in the US; it was listed at #2 on CNN Money's list of "top-earning towns" in the United States as of 2010. Situated between the cities of Norwalk and Stamford, the town is a bedroom community with relatively few office buildings. Most workers commute to Manhattan, and many also work in adjacent cities. Two Metro-North railroad stations – Noroton Heights and Darien – link the town to Grand Central Terminal and the rest of the New Haven Line. For recreation, the town includes four small parks, two public beaches on Long Island Sound, four country clubs, a hunt club, and two yacht clubs. Elected bodies in the town government are a five-member Board of Selectmen, a nine-member Board of Education, a seven-member Board of Finance, a six-member Planning and Zoning Commission, three-member Board of Assessment Appeals, and a 100-member, nonpartisan Representative Town Meeting. The town has several elective offices as well: the town clerk, probate judge, registrar of voters, tax collector and treasurer."Darien Government Guide: 2006", a brochure published by the League of Women Voters of Darien The Board of Finance approves financial measures, including the town budget; the Board of Education controls the town's public schools; the Representative Town Meeting is the main legislative body of the town. As of December 1, 2005, the town had 12,099 registered voters, with 6,445 Republicans (53.1 percent), 1,940 Democrats (16 percent) and 3,703 unaffiliated voters (30.6 percent).Revitalization: Town of Darien Annual Report, 2004–2005, page24  Darien is primarily a Republican town, voting for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, and John McCain in the 2008 election. However, in 2003, Evonne Klein replaced Robert Harrel as First Selectman, becoming the first Democrat to win the post in 14 years. Klein was re-elected in 2005 and again in 2007, but did not run in the November 3, 2009 election, which was won by Republican David Campbell.Shultz, Susan. Klein’s era ends.

A lower mill rate often indicates higher property value, as prestigious Greenwich has the second lowest in the state. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which  is land and , or 13.41%, is water.  The town has four exits on the northbound-traffic side of Interstate 95 (Exits 10–13) and three on the southbound-traffic side (where there is no Exit 12). Its northern border is just south of the Merritt Parkway, where Exits 36 and 37 are closest to the town. It also has two Metro-North railroad stations for commuter trains into New York City, with a  commute of 46–50 minutes from Noroton Heights and 49–53 minutes from Darien. (The Talmadge Hill railroad station on the New Canaan Branch is within walking distance of homes at the far northwestern corner of town, and the Rowayton railroad station is within walking distance of homes near Raymond Street in the southeastern part of town.) Most trains run non-stop after Stamford into New York City's 125th Street, then Grand Central Terminal. Along with the New Haven Line of Metro-North Railroad and Interstate 95, US Route 1, known locally as the Boston Post Road, or, more commonly, the Post Road, runs east-west through the southern side of town. Except for the Noroton Heights business district, commercial zoning is extremely limited outside of the town-wide strip along the Post Road. Darien is bordered on the west by Stamford, on the north by New Canaan, and on the east by Norwalk. On the south it faces Long Island Sound. It is part of the "panhandle" of Connecticut jutting into New York state. The town has  of coastline and five harbors. In addition to some small neighborhoods, the larger divisions of the town are Downtown Darien (area surrounding Boston Post Road from I-95 to Brookside Road), Noroton (roughly in the southwest corner of town on Boston Post Road), Ox Ridge (northern end of Mansfield Avenue), (Noroton Heights (roughly north of Interstate 95 to Middlesex Middle School with an eastern boundary of Noroton Avenue), Noroton Bay (southern end of Noroton Neck), Long Neck Point (southernmost part of town up to historic Ring's End Landing), Delafield Island (waterfront community in between Long Neck and Tokeneke) and Tokeneke (mostly private community in the southeastern end of town).  The town name is pronounced  (like "Dairy-An"), with stress on the last syllable, and has been referred to as such at least as far back as 1913.Jenkins, Stephen, The Old Boston Post Road, (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1913), as quoted at a Web page titled "Darien: Stephen Jenkins' Darien, 1913" at the ""USGenWeb Project" Web site. Retrieved March 28, 2007.The village of Darien, Wisconsin shares this pronunciation; Residents say this is still the proper pronunciation, which in the local dialect is more precisely .See æ-tensing. "You can always tell when someone is not from here, because they do pronounce it the way it's spelled," Louise Berry, director of the town library, said in a 2006 interview."The town name that sounds like a milk maid", "Grapevine" column, The Fairfield County Business Journal, July 10, 2006 The name "Norporiton" originates from an Indian word assigned to the river along Darien's border with Stamford.  This section of Darien is defined by two peninsulas that claw their way into Long Island Sound, their curved appendages protecting enough coves and inlets to make the area a haven for beachgoers and sailors. The shorter of the peninsulas, Noroton Neck, is divided into shore communities like Noroton Bay and Pratt Island. Long Neck, which extends farther into Long Island Sound, provides westerly views of Manhattan. Accessed by the Ring's End Landing bridge, a historic stone structure that marks a major shipping point for early settlers, Long Neck became a summer destination for the wealthy when rail travel made it accessible during the mid-19th century.  Though the general geographic reference to this land feature is "Long Neck Point", therein are two different neighborhoods, each with their own main road and distinct features. Considered Connecticut’s Gold Coast, Long Neck Point is consistently ranked one of the best places to live in America. Historically, it has also been called Collender’s Point and “La Belle” Point. In 1902, Anson Phelps Stokes of the Stokes family built a Gilded Age brick georgian manor on the end, which was later occupied by Andrew Carnegie. Along the west coast is public Pear Tree Point Park beach and the Darien Boat Club on Noroton Harbor. The large island to the east is the remaining estate of the late William Ziegler. The Ziegler Estate is the most expensive undivided private waterfront plot on the eastern seaboard. With an assessed property value of over $22,000,000 and thousands of feet of direct undeveloped waterfront, it boasts the fourth largest property tax in Darien. Carnegie’s manor was later run as the Convent of the Sacred Heart before it was split in half and sold as two private residences. The property on the tip was divided in two and niether home can rise above 20 feet. On its east side, Long Neck Point Road stretches south beginning at Ring's End/Gorham's Pond Bridge and terminates at the southerly most tip of land.  This area is somewhat inland and away from the eastern shoreline and at a relatively high elevation above the water.  Pear Tree Point Road, also beginning at Ring's End/Gorham's Pond Bridge, runs south along the western side of the Point adjacent to "The Gut" and to outer Noroton Harbor.  This charming route hugs the shoreline at an elevation close enough to the tides (at some points) such that storm conditions can bring the salt water harbor over the road.  Approximately half-way south along the peninsula, Pear Tree Point Road turns abruptly to the east, ninety degrees, heading uphill and connecting to Long Neck Point Road. Noroton Heights "blew up around the Noroton Heights train station and housed the European immigrants who serviced the old estates," according to an article about the community in The New York Times. The densely populated streets of this part of town are full of "modest Capes and colonials" along with other house styles. Darien has a humid continental climate, similar to that of New York City, with mild to warm humid summers and cold to very cold winters. The highest recorded temperature was 103&nbsp;°F (39&nbsp;°C) in July 1966, while the lowest recorded temperature was -15&nbsp;°F (-26&nbsp;°C) in 1968. Snowfall is generally frequent in winter while average precipitation is most common in September. According to early records, the first clearings of land were made by men from the New Haven and Wethersfield colonies and from Norwalk in about 1641. It was not until 1740, however, that the Middlesex Society of the Town of Stamford built the first community church, now the First Congregational Church of Darien (which stands on the original site at the corner of Brookside Road and the Boston Post Road).Adapted from: Case, Henry Jay and Cooper, Simon W: Town of Darien. Darien, Connecticut: The Darien Community Association, 1935 The area became Middlesex Parish in 1737.  It was incorporated as the Town of Darien in 1820. Tories (Loyalists) raided the town several times during the American Revolution, at one point taking 26 men in the parish prisoner for five months, including the Rev. Moses Mather, pastor of the parish.  The Loyalist-Patriot conflict in Darien is the setting for the novel Tory Hole, the first book by children's author Louise Hall Tharp. According to the Darien Historical Society,Darien Historical Society Web site the name Darien was decided upon when the residents of the town could not agree on a name to replace Middlesex Parish, many families wanting it to be named after themselves. A sailor who had traveled to Darién, Panama, then part of the Spanish Empire, suggested the name Darien, which was eventually adopted by the people of the town. Until the advent of the railroad in 1848, Darien remained a small, rural community of about 1,000. After the Civil War, the town became one of the many resorts where New Yorkers built luxurious, grand summer homes. Darien has a well-established reputation as a former sundown town,Loewen, James W.

The Darien Fire Department is located at 848 Post Rd.(Rte. 1) in Downtown Darien. The Noroton Fire Department is located at 1873 Post Rd. in the Noroton section of town. The Noroton Heights Fire Department is located at 209 Noroton Ave. in the Noroton Heights section of town. Each fire department responds in conjunction with the other two on most calls and the three fire departments average a total of approximately 1,000 emergency calls for service annually. The three fire departments operate a combined fire apparatus fleet of 6 Engines, 3 Trucks(including 1 Quint), 3 Rescues, 2 Tankers, 1 Fireboat, 1 High-Water Rescue Unit, 3 Utility Units, and 5 Command Units. Regarding ambulance service, see "Post 53" section above. The town is served by two train stations, one in Noroton Heights and the other in downtown Darien. The Connecticut Turnpike (Interstate 95) runs through town, as does the Post Road, U.S. Route 1. Just to the north of town, the Merritt Parkway (Route 15) runs roughly parallel to the northern border between Darien and New Canaan. The Talmadge Hill railroad station is just north of the border as well. Along with the Post Road, major east-west thoroughfares in town are West Avenue and Middlesex Road. Major north-south roads are Hoyt Street, Hollow Tree Ridge Road, Nearwater Lane, Noroton Avenue, Middlesex Road, Mansfield Avenue and Brookside Road. Interstate 95 has rest stops in Darien both for the southbound and northbound lanes. The state Department of Transportation has added "speed change" lanes between entrances and exits up to Exit 10 (and points westward). The phase of the highway widening from Exit 9 to Exit 10, at a cost of $7.5 million, was expected to be complete by October 2007, state Transportation officials said in August of that year. The state is in the process of planning more such lanes through the rest of the highway in town in a project expected to cost $24.5 million. About 150,000 vehicles pass Exit 12 each day, according to the state Department of Transportation. The state was considering closing the southbound entrance for Exit 12 in 2008 during work on the project.Ginocchio, Mark, "I-95 ramp in Darien may close for work", article in The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, pp 1, A4 Chapter 14 of English author Nigel Williams' 1994 travelogue From Wimbledon to Waco tells of his difficulties in reaching Darien from Interstate 95. In December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 million project was completed to add fourth (or "operational") lanes in each direction between the entrances and exits at Exits 10 and 11 in Darien. An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at Exit 10 to Exit 8. After that lane was added, a state Department of Transportation study concluded that accidents were down on that stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year. Construction of operational lanes at exits 11, 12, and 13 was expected to begin in the late spring of 2008.Lucas, Jonathan, "I-95 lanes open in time for holidays: Project aims to ease congestion in Darien", article in The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, December 8, 2007, pp 1, A4, Norwalk edition Darien has many active scout units, including two Boy Scout troops, a Boy Scout Ship, and Explorer Post 53 (see Post 53 section, above), as well as three Cub Scout packs. Both troops and the ship are funded by the Andrew Shaw Memorial Trust; other funding comes from the annual May tag sale at the Scout Cabin on West Avenue, which has raised more than $50,000 in some years. These Scout units are in town: The Ox Ridge Hunt Club sponsors this annual June event, which has attracted up to 16,000 spectators and 1,300 equestrians, some from as far away as California and Europe.

In 1931, a private developer of beachfront property had an easement for access to the beach that stated beach privileges were never to be extended to “any person or persons of the Hebrew race.”Lisa Prevost "Snob zones: Fear, money and real estate" Salon, 30 July 2013  In 1947, Laura Hobson's novel Gentleman's Agreement made Darien briefly notable for "the town's practice of not letting Jews spend the night."  More recently the town has struggled with the issue of affordable housing. Darien is 94% white. Affordable housing was built, but the priority list was such that it effectively excluded minorities by giving excessive priority to current and former residents.  In 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice opened an investigation into Darien for possible violations of the Fair Housing Act. In 2012 they appeared satisfied and closed the investigation.  The town also adopted a policy of verifying incomes for people applying for affordable housing units and maintaining a waiting list.  Darien is one the few municipalities in Connecticut that comply with the State's mandate to report the racial and ethnic makeup of people stopped by the police.  82% of the people stopped are white, 12% are black, 15% are Hispanic.  This is a higher proportion of black people than live in the town, but consistent with the general area population.    Several people notable for their esteemed place in American history have called Darien home: Charles Lindbergh the late aviator, and his wife, author Anne Morrow Lindbergh lived on Tokeneke Trail. Steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie vacationed for several summers at what became the Convent of the Sacred Heart (divided into many private estates in the 1970s) at Long Neck Point. Christopher Shays, the former Republican congressman representing Connecticut's Fourth District, was born in Darien (and now lives in Bridgeport). Jimmy Lee, former Vice Chairman of J.P. Morgan, lived in Darien until his unexpected death in 2015. Actors and actresses who have lived in town include former resident Christopher Plummer, Kate Bosworth, Topher Grace, and Chloë Sevigny. Actress Carol Kane attended Cherry Lawn School in Darien until 1965. Film director Gus Van Sant also went to high school in Darien. Jazz saxophonist Gerry Mulligan lived in Darien in later life and died there in 1996.  Guitarist Chris Risola grew up in Darien.  Musician Moby lived in Darien during his adolescence. Rudolph Valentino was said to have had a Spanish-style home at the entrance of Salem Straits. Emmy-winning television producer and writer Tom Gammill also grew up in Darien. Christopher Plummer owned the tudor manor on Long Neck's eastern shore. People famous in other fields have also called Darien home: Leslie Groves, military head of the Manhattan Project, lived in town after the project ended. Paul Manship, sculptor of the Prometheus figure at Rockefeller Center, spent summers living on Leroy Avenue and working on his art in the early 1930s. Photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White lived in town first with author Erskine Caldwell, then in the same home after their divorce.
