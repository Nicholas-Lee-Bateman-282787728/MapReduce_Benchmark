   The 1971 San Fernando earthquake (also known as the Sylmar earthquake) occurred in the early morning of February 9 in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in southern California. The unanticipated thrust earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.5 or 6.7 (as determined by several independent institutions) and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). The event was one in a series that affected the Los Angeles area in the late 20th century, and a study of the Sierra Madre Fault during that time indicated that more substantial thrust earthquakes had occurred near the Transverse Ranges in the past. Damage was locally severe in the northern San Fernando Valley, and surface faulting was extensive to the south of the epicenter in the mountains, as well as urban settings along city streets and neighborhoods. Uplift and other effects affected private homes and businesses. The event impacted a number of health care facilities in Sylmar, San Fernando, and other densely populated areas north of central Los Angeles. The Olive View Medical Center and Veterans Hospital both experienced very heavy damage, and buildings collapsed at both sites, causing the majority of deaths that occurred. The buildings at both facilities were constructed with mixed styles, but engineers were unable to thoroughly study the buildings' responses because they were not outfitted with instruments for recording strong ground motion, and this prompted the Veterans Administration to install seismometers at its high-risk sites. Other sites throughout the Los Angeles area had been instrumented as a result of local ordinances, and an extraordinary amount of strong motion data was recorded, more so than any other event up until that time. The success in this area spurred the initiation of California's Strong Motion Instrumentation Program.  Transportation around the Los Angeles area was severely afflicted with roadway failures and the partial collapse of several major freeway interchanges. The near total failure of the Lower Van Norman Dam resulted in the evacuation of tens of thousands of downstream residents, though an earlier decision to maintain the water at a lower level may have contributed to saving the [[dam]] from being overtopped. Schools were affected, as they had been during a previous earthquake in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], but this time amended construction styles improved the outcome for the thousands of school buildings in the Los Angeles area. Other aspects of the event included a methane seep that emanated from the floor of the Pacific Ocean near [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] for several days, and hundreds of various types of landslides that were documented in the San Gabriel mountains. As had happened following other earthquakes in California, legislation related to building codes was once again revised, with laws that specifically addressed the construction of homes or businesses near known active fault zones.  == Tectonic setting == {{See also|Thrust tectonics}}  The San Gabriel Mountains are a {{convert|37.3|mi|abbr=on}} long portion of the [[Transverse Ranges]] and are bordered on the north by the [[San Andreas Fault]], on the south by the Cucamonga Fault, and on the southwest side by the Serra Madre Fault.

Although the complete Sierra Madre Fault Zone had previously been mapped and classified by name into its constituent faults, the clusters of fault breaks provided a natural way to identify and refer to each section.

The initial surveyors of the extensive faulting in the valley, foothills, and mountains reported only tectonic faulting, while excluding fissures and other features that arose from the effects of compaction and landsliding. In the vicinity of the Sylmar Fault segment, there was a low possibility of landslides due to a lack of elevation change, but in the foothills and mountainous area a large amount of landsliding occurred and more work was necessary to eliminate the possibility of misidentifying a feature. Along the hill fronts of the Tujunga segment some ambiguous formations were present because some scarps may have had influence from downhill motion, but for the most part they were tectonic in nature.<ref name=Kamb_41-43/>  In repeated measurements of the different fault breaks, the results remained consistent, leading to the belief that most of the slip had occurred during the mainshock. While lateral, transverse, and vertical motions were all observed, the largest individual component of movement was {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} of left lateral slip near the middle of the Sylmar segment. The largest cumulative amount of slip of {{convert|6|ft|7|in|m|sp=us}} occurred along the Sylmar and Tujunga segments. The overall fault displacement was summarized by geologist [[Barclay Kamb]] and others as "nearly equal amounts of north–south compression, vertical uplift (north side up), and left lateral slip and hence may be described as a thrusting of a northern block to the southwest over a southern block, along a fault surface dipping about 45° north."<ref name=Kamb_44>{{harvnb|Kamb|Silver|Abrams|Carter|1971|p=44}}</ref>{{clear}}  === Aftershocks === {| style="float: right;" border="3" class="wikitable" |- | colspan="3" style="text-align: center;" | Aftershocks |- !

Temporary seismometers that were set up in response to the mainshock were up and running from as soon as several hours to several days after the main event and provided additional data until March&nbsp;1.

Several of the smaller shocks approached the area of surface faulting, but for the most part, the area that experienced the heaviest shaking and damage (as a result of the mainshock) lacked aftershock activity. The [[Pacoima Dam]], with its unusually high peak ground acceleration reading, laid very close to the center of that aftershock-free zone.<ref name=Allen/>  === Landslides === {{see also|Landslide classification}}  The USGS commissioned a private company and the [[United States Air Force]] to take [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] over {{convert|97|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of the mountainous areas north of the San Fernando Valley. Analysis revealed that the earthquake triggered over 1,000 landslides. Highly shattered rock was also documented along the ridge tops, and rockfalls (which continued for several days) were the result of both the initial shock and the aftershocks. Few of the slides that were logged from the air were also observed from the ground. The greatest number of slides were centered to the southwest of the mainshock epicenter and close to the areas where surface faulting took place. The slides ranged from {{convert|49|-|984|feet|m}} in length, and could be further categorized as [[rockfall|rock falls]], soil falls, debris slides, avalanches, and [[Slump (geology)|slumps]]. The most frequently-encountered type of slide was the surficial (less than {{convert|3|feet|m}} thick) debris slides and were most often encountered on terrain consisting of [[sedimentary rock]].<ref>{{citation|title=The San Fernando, California, earthquake of February 9, 1971; a preliminary report published jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|chapter=Seismically triggered landslides in the area above the San Fernando Valley|series=Geological Survey Professional Paper 733|year=1971b|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|first1=D. M.|last=Morton|url=http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp733|page=99}}</ref>  === Ground acceleration === In early 1971, the San Fernando Valley was the scene of a congested network of strong-motion seismometers, which provided a total of 241 [[seismogram]]s. This made the earthquake the most documented event (at the time) in terms of strong-motion [[seismology]] (by comparison, the [[1964 Alaska earthquake]] did not provide any strong motion records). Part of the reason there had been so many stations to capture the event was due to a 1965 [[Local ordinance|ordinance]] that required newly constructed buildings in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] and Los Angeles over six stories in height to be outfitted with three of the instruments. This stipulation ultimately found its way into the [[Uniform Building Code]] as an appendix several years later. One hundred seventy-five of the recordings came from these buildings, another 30 were on [[hydraulic structure]]s, and  the remainder were from ground-based installations near faults, including an array of the units across the [[San Andreas Fault]].<ref name=Cloud>{{harvnb|Cloud|Hudson|1975|pp=273, 277, 287}}</ref>  The instrument that was installed at the [[Pacoima Dam]] recorded a [[Peak ground acceleration|peak horizontal acceleration]] of 1.25''g'', a value that was twice as large as anything ever seen from an earthquake. The extraordinarily high acceleration was just one part of the picture, considering that duration and frequency of shaking also play a role in how much damage can occur. The [[accelerometer]] was mounted on a concrete platform on a [[granite]] ridge just above one of the [[arch dam]]'s abutments. Cracks formed in the rocks and a rock slide came within {{convert|15|feet|m|}} of the apparatus, and the foundation remained undamaged, but a small (half-degree) tilt of the unit was discovered that was apparently responsible for closing the horizontal pendulum contacts.  As a result of what was considered a fortunate accident, the machine kept recording for six minutes (until the unit's paper ran out) and the scientists were left with additional data on 30 of the initial aftershocks.<ref name=Cloud/>  == Natural gas emission == {{see also|Petroleum seep|Sedimentary organic matter}}  On the morning of February 9, eyewitnesses noticed abundant natural gas escaping the ocean surface near Malibu Point, which is situated about {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} to the southwest from the earthquake's epicenter. Some homes suffered minor structural damage in that area. The gas had probably been escaping since the time of the mainshock, but had not been noticed because fog had reduced the [[visibility]] close to the coast. The seep originated on the ocean floor under {{convert|6|-|8|m|abbr=on}} of water about {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}} from the mouth of [[Malibu Creek]]. The location was within the Malibu Coast deformation zone that is underlain by a number of north-dipping faults.<ref name=methane>{{citation|title=The San Fernando, California, earthquake of February 9, 1971; a preliminary report published jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|chapter=Methane seep off Malibu Point following the San Fernando earthquake|series=Geological Survey Professional Paper 733|first=H.

The bubbles escaped the ocean's surface over an area that covered {{convert|120|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}} at a rate of one to five per second on February 11, but two days earlier they were emanating at a higher rate, and this is also when an additional zone of bubbles was seen closer to the shore. The gas was coming from small holes and craters on the sea floor that were several millimeters to as large as {{convert|40|cm|sp=us}} in diameter. The craters contained abundant grass and other organic debris, and the greatest concentration of gas appeared to be coming from the areas with the most organic material and from the larger craters.<ref name=methane/>  Samples of the gas were obtained by teams from the [[United States Geological Survey]] and Los Angeles County from near the sea floor, where the [[stratum]] consists of marine shale, mudstone, [[siltstone]], and [[sandstone]]. No ruptures were seen on the sea floor during the exploration dives, and because the cohesive nature of the sediment inhibited its movement on the sea floor, any scarps or fissures that were generated at the time of the earthquake would still have been present since the earthquake had occurred two days prior. It was determined that the composition of the gas had characteristics of marsh gas and had been released after having been formed in the decaying material in the sediment or having been trapped in the bedrock, but neither proposal could be eliminated at the time of the analysis.<ref name=methane/>  == Trench investigation == [[File:USGS - Sierra Madre Fault Zone.gif|thumb|The Sierra Madre Fault Zone highlighted in red]] {{see also|Paleoseismology}}  The San Fernando earthquake was the first in a series ([[1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake|1987 Whittier Narrows]], [[1991 Sierra Madre earthquake|1991 Sierra Madre]], [[1994 Northridge earthquake|1994 Northridge]]) of damaging earthquakes which have occurred on reverse faults in the Los Angeles area within recent times. The events triggered discussions concerning the largest magnitude earthquake that could be generated by one of the faults, especially in the [[Transverse Ranges]], but the focal point of earthquake hazard assessments in California are often the [[San Andreas Fault]] and other associated [[Sinistral and dextral|dextral]] faults. Although there is a lack of paleoseismic data on reverse faults in the Los Angeles area, a trench excavation at a site on the Sierra Madre-Cucamonga fault revealed that two large historic earthquakes occurred in the last 15,000 years.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite journal|title=Evidence for Large Earthquakes in Metropolitan Los Angeles|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/281/5375/398.full|first=C.

A 1980s fault study including mappings and a trench excavation revealed that a major earthquake had most likely not occurred to the east of the San Fernando rupture area for at least the last several thousand, and possibly the last 11,000 years.<ref name=Rubin/>  [[File:Wpdms shdrlfi020l santa susana mountains.jpg|thumb|left|The central Transverse Ranges]]  The fault was studied again in the late 1990s in the Loma Alta Park near Millard Canyon where a fault scarp larger than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} was accessible along a (late [[quaternary]]) elevated stream terrace. The clearly defined fault was exposed in the trench and emerged as a {{convert|.5|m|abbr=on}} band of coarse gravels lining the [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|hanging wall]]. By studying the truncated rocks and a wedge-shaped accumulation of gravel and soil, it was possible to visually reconstruct the original geometry of the rock prior to the thrust and eventual and partial collapse of the hanging wall back onto the footwall. An estimate for the maximum slip of the event was given as {{convert|3.8|-|4|m|sp=us}}.<ref name=Rubin/>  The evidence found at the Loma Alta trench investigation site brought new information into the deliberation regarding the maximum size of earthquakes near Los Angeles. The large amount of slip observed there did not correspond with a short {{convert|15|-|20|km|abbr=on}} rupture length of the Sierra Madre Fault Zone, and instead suggested that the historical thrust earthquakes were much larger in magnitude than what was seen with the 1971 event, given its smaller {{convert|2|m|sp=us}} of maximum observed displacement. Two methods were employed to infer the scope of the events at the site (one regression-based and the other based on the [[seismic moment]]) and produced a maximum magnitude of 7.5 or 7.6 for the most recent movement of the fault. The results supported an earlier hypothesis that seismic energy release on the Sierra Madre Fault Zone is characterized by infrequent but large earthquakes. A duplicate event in modern times would rupture to the south towards populated areas and would produce [[strong ground motion]] capable of damaging modern buildings and other critical infrastructure.<ref name=Rubin/>{{clear}}  == Damage == {{see also|Convento Building (Mission San Fernando)|Mission San Fernando Rey de España}}  The areas that were affected by the strongest shaking were the outlying communities north of [[Los Angeles]] that are bounded by the northern edge of the San Fernando Valley at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. The unincorporated districts of [[Newhall, Santa Clarita, California|Newhall]], [[Saugus, Santa Clarita, California|Saugus]], and Solemint Junction had moderate damage, even to newer buildings. The area where the heaviest effects were present was limited by geographical features on the three remaining margins, with the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] on the west, the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] and the [[Los Angeles River]] to the south, and along the [[Verdugo Mountains]] to the east. Loss of life that was directly attributable to the earthquake amounted to 58 (a number of heart attack and other health-related deaths were not included in this figure). Most deaths occurred at the Veterans and Olive View hospital complexes, and the rest were located at private residences, the highway overpass collapses, and a ceiling collapse at the [[Midnight Mission]] in downtown Los Angeles.<ref>{{harvnb|Steinbrugge|Schader|Moran|1975|pp=323–325}}</ref>  [[File:USGS - 1971 San Fernando earthquake - Olive View Hospital - Partially detached stairway.jpg|thumb|Partially detached stairway and severely damaged building at Olive View]]  The damage was greatest both near, and well north of the surface faulting, as well as at the foot of the mountains. The hospital buildings, the freeway overpasses, and the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility were situated on coarse [[alluvium]] that overlaid thousands of feet of loosely consolidated sedimentary material. Underground water, sewer, and gas systems did not fare well in the city of San Fernando where the breaks were too numerous to count, and some sections were so badly damaged that they were abandoned. Ground displacement damaged sidewalks and roadways, with cracks in the more rigid asphalt and concrete often exceeding the width of the shift in the underlying soil. Accentuated damage near alluvium had been documented previously during the investigation of the effects of the [[1969 Santa Rosa earthquakes]]. A band of similarly intense damage further away near [[Ventura Boulevard]] at the southern end of the valley was also identified as having been related to [[soil type]].<ref>{{harvnb|Steinbrugge|Schader|Moran|1975|pp=350–353}}</ref>  A number of federal, county, and [[private hospital]]s suffered varying degrees of damage, with four major facilities in the San Fernando Valley experiencing structural damage, and two of those experiencing collapse. The Indian Hills Medical Center, Foothill Medical Building, and the Pacoima Lutheran Professional building were all heavily damaged, but nursing homes were also affected. One facility in particular, the one-story Foothill Nursing Home, sat very close to a section of the fault that broke the surface and was raised up three feet relative to the street. Scarps ran along the sidewalk and across the property, but the building was not in use at the time, and remained standing. Though the reinforced [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete block]] structure was afflicted by the shock and uplift, the relatively good performance was in stark contrast to the Olive View and Veterans Hospital complexes.<ref name=Steinbrugge_341-346/>  === Olive View Hospital === {{main|Olive View – UCLA Medical Center}}  The majority of the buildings at the [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]-owned, 880-bed hospital complex had been built prior to the adoption of new construction techniques that had been put in place following the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]]. Some of the buildings at the large facility escaped damage, like the set of one-story structures 300 feet west of the new facility, and those that did have damage consisted of either wood frame or masonry structures. The five-story reinforced concrete Medical Treatment and Care Building was one of three new additions to the complex (all three sustained damage) and was assembled with [[Earthquake resistant structures|earthquake-resistant construction]] techniques and was completed in December, 1970. The hospital was staffed with 98 employees and had 606 patients at the time of the earthquake and all three of the deaths that occurred at the Olive View complex were in this building. Two were due to power failure of life support systems and one, an employee who was struck by a portion of the collapsing building as they attempted to exit the building, was a direct result of the destruction.<ref name=Steinbrugge_341-346>{{harvnb|Steinbrugge|Schader|Moran|1975|pp=341–346}}</ref>  [[File:USGS - 1971 San Fernando earthquake - Olive View Hospital - Detached stairways alternate.jpg|thumb|left|Fallen stair towers and damaged basement level at the Olive View Hospital]]  The Medical Treatment and Care Building included a [[basement]] level that was exposed (above grade) on the east and south sides, mixed (above and below grade) on the west side, and below grade on the north side of the building, due to the shallow slope at the site. The complete structure, including the four external stairways, could be considered five separate buildings, since the stair towers were detached from the main building by about four inches. Earthquake bracing used in the building's second through fifth floors consisted of [[shear wall]]s, but a rarely used [[slip joint]] technique used with the concrete walls at the first floor level excluded them from being used with that system. Damage to the building (including ceiling tiles, telephone equipment, and elevator doors) was described as excessive at the basement and first floor levels, with little damage further up. The difference in rigidity at the second floor was proposed as a cause of the considerable damage to the lower levels. As a result of the first floor nearly collapsing, the building was leaning to the north by nearly two feet, and three of the four concrete stair towers fell away from the main building.<ref name=Steinbrugge_341-346/>  On the grounds of the facility, cracks in the pavement and soil were present, but no surface faulting was present. In addition to the collapse of the stairways, the elevators were out of commission. Power and communications failures affected the hospital at the time of the earthquake, but very few people occupied the lower floors and the stairways at the early hour. Casualties in these highly affected areas might have increased had the shock occurred later in the day. The duration of strong ground motion at that location was probably similar to the 12 seconds that was observed at the Pacoima Dam, and an additional few seconds of shaking is thought to have been enough to bring the building to collapse.<ref name=Steinbrugge_341-346/>{{clear}}  === Veterans Hospital === [[File:USGS - 1971 San Fernando earthquake - Collapse of four buildings at the Veterans Hospital.jpg|thumb|Collapse of four buildings at the Veterans Hospital complex]]  The Veterans Hospital entered into service as a tuberculosis hospital in 1926 and became a general hospital in the 1960s. By 1971, the facility comprised 45 individual buildings, all lying within {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} of the fault rupture in Sylmar, but the structural damage was found to have occurred as a result of the shaking and not from ground displacement or faulting. Twenty-six buildings that were built prior to 1933 had been constructed following the local building codes and did not require seismic-resistant designs. These buildings suffered the most damage, with four buildings totally collapsing, which resulted in a large loss of life at the facility.

It had been established that these zones had a higher likelihood of experiencing strong ground acceleration, and the plan was made to furnish the selected VA hospitals with two instruments. One unit would be installed within the structure and the second would be set up as a free-field unit located a short distance away from the facility. As of 1973, a few of the highest risk (26 were completed in zone 3 alone) sites that had been completed were in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].<ref name=Bolt/>  === Van Norman Dam === [[File:Lower Van Norman Dam Damage 1971.jpg|thumb|left|Damage to the Lower Van Norman Dam]] {{see also|Baldwin Hills Reservoir|Bull Creek (Los Angeles County)}}  Both the Upper and Lower Van Norman dams were severely damaged as a result of the earthquake. The lower dam was very close to breaching, and approximately 80,000 people were evacuated for four days while the water level in the reservoir was lowered. This was done as a precaution to accommodate further collapse due to a strong aftershock. Some canals in the area of the dams were damaged and not usable, and dikes experienced slumping but these did not present a hazard. The damage at the lower dam consisted of a landslide that dislocated a section of the embankment. The earthen lip of the dam fell into the reservoir and brought with it the concrete lining, while what remained of the dam was just {{convert|5|feet|m}} above the water level. The upper lake [[Subsidence|subsided]] {{convert|3|feet|m}} and was displaced about {{convert|5|feet|m}} as a result of the ground movement, and the dam's concrete lining cracked and slumped.<ref name=Youd_126-129>{{citation|title=The San Fernando, California, earthquake of February 9, 1971; a preliminary report published jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|chapter=Damage to constructed works, associated with soil movements and foundation failures|series=Geological Survey Professional Paper 733|year=1971|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|first1=T.

An inspection of the lower dam in 1964 paved the way towards an arrangement between the [[State of California]] and the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] that would maintain the reservoir's water level that was reduced 10 feet lower than was typical. Since the collapse of the dam lowered its overall height, the decision to reduce its capacity proved to be a valuable bit of insurance.<ref name=Youd_126-129/>  Differential ground motion and strong shaking (MMI VIII (''Severe'')) was responsible for serious damage to the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility and the [[Sylmar Converter Station]] (both located close to the Upper Van Norman lake). The [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]], as well as the County of Los Angeles, investigated and verified that local soil conditions contributed to the ground displacement and resulting destruction. The area of surface breaks on the ground at the site was {{convert|900|ft|abbr=on}} (at its widest) and stretched {{convert|4000|ft|abbr=on}} down a 1% grade slope towards the southwest. As much as {{convert|5|ft|abbr=on}} of lateral motion was observed on either end of the slide, and trenches that were excavated during the examination at the site revealed that some of the cracks were up to {{convert|15|ft|abbr=on}} deep. The two facilities, located near Grapevine and Weldon canyons that channel water and debris off the Sierra Madre Mountains, are lined by steep ridges and have formed [[alluvial fan]]s at their mouths. The narrow band of ground disturbances were found to have been the result of settling of the soft soil in a downhill motion. [[Soil liquefaction]] played a role within confined areas of the slide, but it was not responsible for all the motion at the site, and tectonic slip of faults in the area was also excluded as a cause.<ref>{{citation|title=San Fernando, California, earthquake of 9 February 1971|url=http://archive.org/details/sanfernandocalif00oakerich|first=J.

On Interstate 5, the most significant damage was between the Newhall Pass interchange on the north end and the [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]] / [[Interstate 405 (California)|I-405]] interchange in the south, where subsidence at the bridge approaches and cracking and buckling of the roadway made it unusable. Several landslides occurred between [[Balboa Boulevard]] and [[California State Route 14]], but the most significant damage occurred at the two major interchanges. The Antelope Valley Freeway had damage from Newhall Pass to the northeast, primarily from settling and alignment issues, as well as splintering and cracking at the [[Santa Clara River (California)|Santa Clara River]] and Solemint bridges.<ref>{{citation|title=San Fernando, California, earthquake of 9 February 1971|url=http://archive.org/details/sanfernandocalif00oakerich|author=California Division of Highways|year=1975|chapter=Highway damage in the San Fernando earthquake|series=Bulletin 196|publisher=[[California Geological Survey|California Division of Mines and Geology]]|page=369}}</ref>  ;Golden State Freeway – Antelope Valley Freeway Interchange [[File:NOAA - NGDC - 1971 San Fernando Earthquake - Collapse of Newhall Pass interchange.tif|thumb|Aerial view of the damage suffered by the [[Newhall Pass interchange]].]] {{main|Newhall Pass interchange}}  While the Newhall Pass interchange was still under construction at the time of the earthquake, the requisite components of the overpass were complete. Vibration caused two of the bridge's 191-foot sections to fall from a maximum height of {{convert|140|ft|abbr=on}}, along with one of the supporting pillars. The spans slipped off of their supports at either end due to lack of proper ties and insufficient space (a {{convert|14|in|abbr=on}} seat was provided) on the support columns. Ground displacement at the site was ruled out as a major cause of the failure, and in addition to the fallen sections and a crane that was struck during the collapse, other portions of the overpass were also damaged. Shear cracking occurred at the column closest to the western abutment, and  the ground at the same column's base exhibited evidence of rotation.<ref name=Jennings>{{citation|title=Engineering features of the San Fernando earthquake of February 9, 1971|chapter=Earthquake damage to freeway structures|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/26440/|first=P.

Several instances of failure or collapse at the site took place and two men were killed while driving in a [[pickup truck]] as a result. The westbound I-210 to southbound I-5, which was complete except for paving at the ramp section, collapsed to the north, likely because of vibration that moved the overpass off its supports due to an inadequate seat. Unlike the situation at the Antelope Valley Interchange, permanent ground movement (defined as several inches of left-lateral displacement with possibly an element of thrusting) was observed in the area. The movement contributed to heavy damage at the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility, Sylmar Converter Station, and the Metropolitan Water District Treatment Plant, but its effects on the interchange was not completely understood as of a 1971 report from the [[California Institute of Technology]].<ref name=Jennings/>  === Schools === {{see also|Atwater Avenue Elementary School (Los Angeles)|Bishop Alemany High School|John Marshall High School (Los Angeles)|Patrick Henry Middle School (Los Angeles, California)}}  The large number of public school buildings in the Los Angeles area displayed mixed responses to the shaking, and those that were built after the enforcement of the [[Field Act]] clearly showed the results of the reformed construction styles. The Field Act was put into effect just one month following the destructive March 1933 Long Beach earthquake that damaged many public school buildings in Long Beach, [[Compton, California|Compton]], and [[Whittier, California|Whittier]]. The [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] had 660 schools consisting of 9,200 buildings at the time of the earthquake, with 110 [[masonry]] buildings that had not been reinforced to meet the new standards. More than 400 [[portable classroom]]s and 53 [[Timber framing|wood frame]] pre-Field Act buildings were also in use. All these buildings had been previously inspected with regard to the requirements of the Act, and many were reinforced or rebuilt at that time, but earthquake engineering experts recommended further immediate refurbishment or demolition after a separate evaluation was done after the February 1971 earthquake, and within a year and a half the district followed through with the direction with regard to about 100 structures.<ref name=Meehan>{{citation|title=San Fernando, California, earthquake of 9 February 1971|url=http://archive.org/details/sanfernandocalif00oakerich|first=J.

The main building was demolished at a cost of $127,000, and none of the various post-Field Act buildings were damaged at the site. Except for the concrete gymnasium, all of the buildings at [[Sylmar High School]] ({{convert|3.75|mi|abbr=on}} from Pacoima Dam) were post-Field Act, one-story, wood construction. Abundant cracks formed in the ground at the site, and some foundations and many sidewalks were also cracked. The estimate for repairs at the site was $485,000. At {{convert|2|mi|abbr=on}}, Hubbard Street Elementary School was the closest school to Pacoima dam, and was also less than a mile from the Veterans Hospital complex. The wood frame buildings (classrooms, a multipurpose building, and some bungalows) were built after the Field Act, and damage and cleanup costs there totaled $42,000. Gas lines were broken and separation of the buildings' porches was due to lateral displacement of up to six inches.<ref name=Meehan/>  == Aftermath == {{see also|List of fault zones}}  Following many of California's major earthquakes, lawmakers have acted quickly to develop legislation related to seismic safety. After the M6.4 [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] the Field Act was passed the following month, and after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act and Senate Bill 1953 (hospital safety requirements) were established. Following the San Fernando event, earthquake engineers and seismologists from established scientific organizations, as well as the newly formed Los Angeles County Earthquake Commission, stated their recommendations that were based on the lessons learned. The list of items needing improvements included building codes, dams and bridges being made more earthquake resistant, hospitals that are designed to remain operational, and the restriction of development near known fault zones. New legislation included the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act and the development of the Strong Motion Instrumentation Program.<ref name=Geschwind>{{cite book|title=California Earthquakes: Science, Risk, and the Politics of Hazard Mitigation|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/California_Earthquakes.html?id=rTHwnFWSzcMC|first=C.|last=Geschwind|year=2001|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=978-0801865961|pages=166, 170, 171}}</ref><ref name=Bryant>{{cite journal|title=History of the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act, California, USA|url=http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/83738/10-mapping-history-of-alquist-priolo-act.pdf|first=W.

The act restricts construction of buildings designed for human occupancy across potentially [[active fault]]s. Since it is presumed that surface rupture will likely take place where past surface displacement has occurred, the state geologist was given the responsibility for evaluating and mapping faults that had evidence of [[Holocene]] rupture, and creating regulatory zones around them called Earthquake Fault Zones. State and local agencies (as well as the property owner) were then responsible for enforcing or complying with the building restrictions.<ref name=Bryant/>  ;California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program  Prior to the San Fernando earthquake, some structural engineers had already believed that the existing groundwork for seismic design required enhancement. Although instruments had recorded a force of .33''g'' during the [[1940 El Centro earthquake]], building codes only required structures to withstand a lateral force of .1''g'' as late as the 1960s. Even at that time, engineers were against the idea of constructing buildings to resist the high forces that were seen in the El Centro shock, but after a 1966 earthquake peaked at .5''g'', and a maximum of 1.25''g'' was observed at the [[Pacoima Dam]] during the San Fernando event, debate began as to whether that low requirement was sufficient.<ref name=Geschwind/>  Despite the compelling seismogram from the 1940 event in El Centro, strong-motion seismology was not explicitly sought until later events occurred—the San Fernando earthquake made evident the need for more data for earthquake engineering applications. The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program was initiated in 1971 with the goal of maximizing the volume of data by furnishing and maintaining instruments at selected lifeline structures, buildings, and ground response stations. By the late 1980s, the program had instrumented more than 450 structures, bridges, dams, and power plants. The [[1979 Imperial Valley earthquake|1979 Imperial Valley]] and [[1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake]]s were presented as gainful events that were recorded during that period, because both produced valuable data that increased knowledge of how moderate events affect buildings. The success of the Imperial Valley event was especially pronounced because of a recently constructed and fully instrumented government building that was shaken to the point of failure.<ref>{{citation|title=International Handbook of Earthquake & Engineering Seismology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aFNKqnC2E-sC&pg=PA273&lpg=PA273&dq=san+fernando+california+strong+motion+instrumentation+program&source=bl&ots=8LQpwu3ZGZ&sig=YwweD10-Tl3hKavezUjVsxFKNJs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WFqIUZGdK-LJiQLtkoDgDQ&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=san%20fernando%20california%20strong%20motion%20instrumentation%20program&f=false|series=Part A, Volume 81A|chapter=Challenges in observational seismology|first=W.
