    Nigella Lucy Lawson (born 6 January 1960) is an English journalist, broadcaster, television personality, gourmet, and food writer. She is the daughter of Nigel Lawson, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Vanessa (née Salmon) Lawson, whose family owned the J. Lyons and Co. food and catering business. After graduating from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University, Lawson started work as a book reviewer and restaurant critic, later becoming the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986. She then embarked upon a career as a freelance journalist, writing for a number of newspapers and magazines. In 1998, she brought out her first cookery book, How to Eat, which sold 300,000 copies and became a best-seller. She wrote her second book in 2000, How to Be a Domestic Goddess, which won her the British Book Award for Author of the Year. In 1999, she hosted her own cooking show series, Nigella Bites, on Channel 4, accompanied by another best-selling cookbook. Nigella Bites won Lawson a Guild of Food Writers Award; her 2005 ITV daytime chat show Nigella was met with a negative critical reaction and was cancelled after attracting low ratings. She hosted the Food Network's Nigella Feasts in the United States in 2006, followed by a three-part BBC Two series, Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, in the UK, which led to the commissioning of Nigella Express on BBC Two in 2007. Her own cookware range, Living Kitchen, has a value of £7 million, and she has sold more than 3 million cookery books worldwide to date.

As her father, Nigel, is a prominent political figure, some of the things she found frustrating were the judgements and pre-conceptions about her. She has attributed her unhappiness as a child, in part, to the problematic relationship she had with her mother. Lawson's mother died of liver cancer in Westminster, London at the age of 48.

On 31 July 2013, seven weeks after the incident, the pair was granted a decree nisi, ending their ten-year marriage. They reached a private financial settlement. On 27 November 2013, a trial of the former couple's two personal assistants, Italian-born sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, began in R v Grillo and Grillo. The Grillos were accused of fraudulently using the credit cards of Saatchi's private company."Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi marriage 'secrecy'", BBC News, 27 November 2013 During court proceedings in early December, the sisters claimed that Lawson had permitted their use of the credit cards in exchange for their silence regarding her drug use. Questions regarding Lawson's drug use were allowed by the judge as part of the sisters' "bad character" defence. Lawson admitted to taking cocaine and cannabis but denied she had been addicted, stating, "I found it made an intolerable situation tolerable."  On 20 December 2013, the two sisters were acquitted. Scotland Yard confirmed that Lawson would not be the subject of an investigation based on claims made in court that she consumed cocaine. The decision will be reviewed if new evidence comes to light. It has been alleged that Charles Saatchi started a smear campaign against Lawson in the British media, through PR man Richard Hillgrove, relating to her drug use that began even before the trial was over.Nigella Lawson facing Scotland Yard drugs investigation by David Barrett and Robert Mendick in The Telegraph, 21 December 2013.

Although both of Lawson's parents are Jewish, her upbringing was non observant and Lawson herself identifies as an atheist."I was brought up an atheist and have always remained so. But at no time was I led to believe that morality was unimportant or that good and bad did not exist.
