  North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (also known as North Carolina A&T State University, North Carolina A&T, N.C. A&T, or simply A&T) is a public, coeducational, historically black, research university located in Greensboro, North Carolina, United States. It is a constituent institution of the University of North Carolina, one of the oldest public universities in the United States. Founded by act of the North Carolina General Assembly, on March 9, 1891, as The "Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race;" it is the second college established under the provisions of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts; and first for people of color in the state of North Carolina. Initially, the college offered instruction in Agriculture, English, Horticulture, and Mathematics. In 1967, The college was designated a Regional University by the North Carolina General Assembly and renamed "North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University." Today, with an enrollment of over 10,000 students, North Carolina A&T is the largest historically black university in the nation. According to the U.S. News & World Report, the university was ranked 8th nationally, and 1st among public historically black institutions. The university is also well recognized for its degree program in engineering. The university's College of Engineering has consistently ranked first in the nation for the number of degrees awarded to African-Americans at the undergraduate level, and is a leading producer of African-American engineers with master's and doctorate degrees. The university is also a leading producer of African-American psychology undergraduates; minority certified public accountants, landscape architects, veterinarians, and agricultural graduates. The university offers 177 Undergraduate, 30 master, and 9 doctoral degrees through its two professional colleges and seven schools; The university awards over 1,900 degrees annually, and has an alumni base around 40,000 in numbers. The main campus encompasses over  in area, additionally, the university operates a  working farm, and two research parks totaling a combined . The university is classified as a high activity research university by The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The university ranks third in sponsored funding among University of North Carolina system institutions, As of 2012, the university conducts over $29 Million in academic and scientific research annually, and operates 16 research centers and institutes on campus. The university's designation as a land grant institution reflects its broad range of research with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Defense, National Institutes of Health, and the National Space Foundation The school's students, alumni, and sports teams are known as "Aggies." The university's varsity athletic teams, are members of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, in all sports with the exception of women's swimming, and compete in the NCAA's Division I. The football team are three time Black College Football National Champions, and enjoyed much success in the 1990s. The men's basketball team has earned 16 total conference regular-season and tournament championships, including an eight consecutive titles in the 1980s. In 2013, the program won their first NCAA tournament game after nine previous appearances. The women's basketball program is the first team from a Division I historically black university to win two games in a post-season tournament when the Lady Aggies advanced to the regional semifinals in the 2010 Women's National Invitation Tournament  North Carolina A&T's history can be traced back to 1890 when the United States Congress passed the The Second Morrill Act. Aimed mainly at the confederate states, the second Morrill Act of 1890 required that each state show that race was not an admissions criterion, or else to designate a separate land-grant institution for persons of color. In order to comply with the Second Morrill Act and yet prevent admission of African Americans to the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, the college's Board of Trustees were empowered to make temporary arrangements for students of color. On March 9, 1891, the "Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race" was established by an act of the North Carolina General Assembly as an annex of the private Shaw University in Raleigh. The act read in part: "That the leading objective of the college shall be to teach practical agriculture and the mechanic arts and such learning as related thereto, not excluding academic and classical instruction." The college, which started with four teachers and 37 students, initially offered instruction in Agriculture, English, Horticulture, and Mathematics. The college continued to operate in Raleigh until the Board of Trustees voted, in 1892, to relocate the college to Greensboro. With monetary and land donations totaling $11,000 and 14 acres (57,000 mÂ²), the new Greensboro campus was established the following year and the college's first President, John Oliver Crosby, was elected on May 25, 1892.  The college granted admission to both men and women of color from 1893, until the Board of Trustees voted to restrict admission to males only in 1901. This policy would remain until 1928, when female students were once again allowed to be admitted. In 1899, The college conferred its first degrees to seven graduates. In 1904, the college developed a 100-acre farm equipped with the latest in farm machinery and labor-saving devices. During that time, the university farm provided much of the food for the campus cafeteria. In 1915, the North Carolina General Assembly changed the name of the college to Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina.  In 1925, Dr. Ferdinand D. Bluford was selected as the third president of the college, and A&T became a member of the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association (now known as the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association). The next year, the College's National Alumni Association was established. In 1928, the 27-year ban on female students was lifted as the college once again was granted co-educational status. By December 1931, female students are allowed, for the first time, to participate in the student government as members of the student council. In 1939, the college was authorized to grant the Master of Science degree in education and certain other fields. Two years later, the first Master of Science degree was awarded.  The 1940s and 1950s saw the college expand its land holdings. In 1946, the college acquired 96 acres of land adjacent to the original 14-acre campus In 1953, The School of Nursing was established, with the first class graduating four years later. 1955 saw more changes, as Dr. Warmoth T. Gibbs was selected as the fourth President of the College. Two years later, the college experienced another name change to the "Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina". In that same year, the college's first white student, Rodney Jaye Miller of Greensboro, was admitted.  In 1959, the college was fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The role that students of North Carolina A&T have played during the 1960s has been controversial at times. On February 1, 1960, four freshmen men helped spark the civil rights movement in the South. Ezell Blair (Jibreel Khazan), Joseph McNeil, Franklin McCain, and David Richmond "sat-in" at an all white eating establishment (Woolworth's) and demanded equal service at the lunch counter. The actions of the four freshmen gained momentum as other students of the university joined them in their non-violent protest to desegregate Woolworth's lunch counter, which became known as the Greensboro sit-ins. By the end of July 1960, Blair, McNeil, McCain and Richmond were dubbed the Greensboro Four. In 1964, John A. Steinhauer, a science teacher, was the first white student to earn a degree from A&T, earning the Master of Science in Education with a concentration in Chemistry. The following year, the College acquired the land of the former Immanuel Lutheran College, a coeducational junior college located adjacent to the college campus. In 1967, The college was designated a Regional University by the NC General Assembly. The college was renamed "North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University,"  In 1969, students protesters from the college, in addition to students of nearby James B. Dudley High School, were involved in a four-day conflict with the Greensboro Police and the National Guard in which there was one casualty. The conflict, referred to as the 1969 Greensboro uprising lasted between May 21 through May 25, was sparked by perceived civil rights issues at the segregated high school, when a popular student council write-in presidential candidate was denied his landslide victory allegedly because school officials feared his activism in the Black Power movement. Starting on the campus of Dudley High School, the uprising spread to A&T's campus, where students had stood up in support of the Dudley protest. Escalating violence eventually led to an armed confrontation and the subsequent invasion of the campus. Described at the time as "the most massive armed assault ever made against an American university," The uprising ended soon after the National Guard raided and raid of the 505-room male dormitory, W. Kerr Scott Hall, taking hundreds of students into protective custody. In 1971, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation bringing all 16 public institutions that confer bachelor degrees into the University of North Carolina System. As a result of the consolidation, N.C. A&T became a constituent institution and Lewis Carnegie Dowdy, the College's sixth president, was reappointed as the college's first chancellor in July of the following year. The 1988 school year saw NC A&T set an enrollment record with 6,200 students. The following year, the college bested its record with a total of 6,500 students. In 2003, the university announced the creation of a Joint Millennial Campus, with neighboring UNC-Greensboro, with the intent to focus on regional economic development. The following year, the university was classified as a doctoral/research intensive university by the Carnegie Foundation, in addition to forming a partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). On May 1, 2006, Lloyd V. Hackley was named Interim Deputy Chancellor of the university. Hackley served in the position until his successor. Stanley F. Battle was installed as the 11th Chancellor on April 25, 2008. Under the Battle administration, the university was awarded an $18 million grant from the National Science Foundation for an Engineering Research Center, the first time an HBCU has been a lead institution for such a center. On May 22, 2009, Dr. Harold L. Martin, Sr. was elected as the twelfth Chancellor of the University. The following year, N.C. A&T received approval to establish a Ph.D. program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) beginning in the fall of 2010. That same year, the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (JSNN) opened with 17 students in the doctoral program in nanoscience and 1 student in the professional master's program in nanoscience. According to the National Nanotechnology Initiative, The JSNN became one of fewer than 10 schools nationally to offer degree programs in nanotechnology, and is the only program created and operated collaboratively by two universities. In 2011, North Carolina A&T received approval from the University of North Carolina Board of Governors for its Master of Science in Nanoengineering program, Offered through the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (JSNN). In addition to the M.S. degree the university was approved to offer a doctoral program in Nanoengineering.   North Carolina A&T's main campus, often referred to as "Aggieland," is located approximately nine blocks east of downtown Greensboro, North Carolina, a city that supports a population of 277,080  and is one of three principal cities that forms the Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point CSA also referred to as the Piedmont Triad region. Development of the campus started in 1893 with  of donated land. Today, the main campus encompasses over  in area, and 123 total buildings, which include 28 Academic buildings, 15 Student residences, and various support buildings and athletic facilities. In addition, the physical plant also includes the  working farm, and Two Research Parks totaling a combined . The main roads that create the campus boundaries are East Bessemer street, to the north; East Market street, to the south; North O'Henry Boulevard (U.S. Route 220/U.S. 29/U.S. 70), to the east; North Dudley street, to the west; and East Lindsay street to the northeast. The main entry point of the campus is located at the intersection of East Market street and North Benbow road. A portion of today's main campus comprises the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina Historic District, which was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. This  area along the university's western boundary, consists of five Colonial Revival and Classical Revival style buildings that are the universities oldest standing structures.  Located inside the James B. Dudley Memorial Building, the university galleries are home to the Mattye Reed African Heritage and the H. Clinton Taylor Collections. Founded in the late 1960s, the Reed African Heritage Collection is dedicated to the ancestral and contemporary arts of Africa and the Caribbean. The Reed Collection houses around 3,500 artifacts, art, and craft items from more than 35 African and Caribbean nations. The collection is named for Mattye Reed, the site's first curator and director. Reed helped collect a great number of the pieces through soliciting donations from friends and former colleagues on behalf of the university. The Taylor Collection, named for the founder of the university's art department, presents rotating exhibits by both established and upstart African-American Artists, in addition to work created by the university students and faculty. The University of North Carolina spends roughly $227 million a year on energy. In 2009, the UNC Board of Governors adopted environmental policies reflective of the UNC System's commitment to lead the State of North Carolina to a more sustainable future. The goal of the initiative is to reduce energy consumption by 30% at all UNC institutions and affiliates by 2015. Since 2003, North Carolina A&T has reduced energy use by 21%. According to research conducted by the university, the energy efficiency measures in place inside the 123 buildings on the campus have saved enough energy to meet the power needs of 760 households for a year. In the 2011â12 fiscal year alone, a 32.5 billion BTU reduction in energy helped the university avoid $386,274 in costs. Under the university's Strategic Energy Plan, N.C. A&T has implemented energy efficiency measures such as: comprehensive energy audits to identify improvement needs; development of a retro-commissioning process for existing buildings; energy-efficient lighting retrofits throughout the campus; and the development of green network strategies. In the area of green building, the university is in the process of developing a green building policy that will require the use of sustainable and green building practices wherever feasible and practical on future construction. As of 2015, there are four green building initiatives being conducted by the university. The Proctor School of Education Building utilizes green roof technology in addition to other sustainable components aimed at reducing storm water runoff and energy demands for air conditioning in the summer months. Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (JSNN) Building located at the off-campus Joint Millennial Campus site, was certified as a LEED Gold level building in 2013. In addition to the school of education and Nanotechnology buildings, the university is planning an environmentally-friendly student union and opened its new student health center in 2015. The two-story, 27,548-square-foot building is LEED silver level certified, and the university's first completely green facility. Through these efforts towards sustainability and environment friendly university management, N.C. A&T was ranked 10th, out of 301 institutions from 61 countries, in the 2013 The Universitas Indonesia (UI) GreenMetric World University Sustainability Ranking. Additionally, the university ranked 5th among 164 institutions in the category of Campus Setting (Urban) and 9th among 224 institutions in the Comprehensive Higher Education category.  North Carolina A&T is one of 16 public universities that constitute the University of North Carolina System. As a constituent institution of the UNC System, NC A&T is governed by a Board of Governors and administered by a president. The 32 voting members of the Board of Governors are elected by the State General Assembly for four-year terms. The current President of the UNC System is Thomas W. Ross.  Each of the UNC campuses is headed by a chancellor who is chosen by the Board of Governors on the president's nomination and is responsible to the president. The current Chancellor of NC A&T is Dr. Harold L. Martin Sr. In 2009, Martin became the 12th Chancellor of the university, and first alumnus to serve in the position, following the resignation of his predecessor, Stanley F. Battle. Prior to his appointment as chancellor, Martin was the senior vice president for academic affairs at The University of North Carolina, General Administration where he led the development and implementation of the University's academic mission, including teaching, research, international programs and student affairs. Martin currently serves on the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) Commission on Colleges and Schools and on the boards of technology nonprofit MCNC and Blue Cross and Blue Shield Foundation. Previously, he served on advisory committees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, chaired the board of directors of the Southern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering, and served on the boards of trustees of the NC School of Science and Mathematics, the NC Board of Science and Technology, and the NC Biotechnology Center Advisory Board. In the UNC System, each university has their own board of trustees. N.C. A&T's Board of Trustees consists of eight members elected by the Board of Governors, four appointed by the governor, and the president of the student body, who serves as an ex officio member. The current Chair of the Board is Patricia Miller Zollar. Zollar is a Managing Director of independent asset management firm Neuberger Berman. Other Trustees include: Willie A. Deese, Executive Vice President and President of the Merck Manufacturing Division, Spence Broadhurst, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Sales Officer for NewBridge Bank, and Janice Bryant Howroyd, Chairman and CEO of the Act-1 Group. The 2013â2014 budget totaled $244 million, with $160 million (65.5%) from the state of North Carolina and $34 million coming from contracts and grants. Although the university is mostly state funded, North Carolina A&T's budget for the 2014 fiscal year has dropped by $6.3 million due in part to Governor Pat McCrory submitting a proposal for budget cuts to the General Assembly that recommended reductions to the UNC System. As of 2012, the university endowment was valued at just over $28 million. North Carolina A&T is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), which is one of the six regional accreditation organizations recognized by the United States Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. N.C. A&T holds the distinction as being the nation's leading producer of African American engineers, in addition to being the leading producer of African-American women engineers at the bachelor's level. The university is third largest producer of African-American engineers at the masters level behind Georgia Institute of Technology and Johns Hopkins University; and the leading producer of African-American doctorates in engineering. The university is also noted for its degrees in Agriculture. The School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences is the largest agricultural school among historically black universities, and the nation's second largest producer of minority agricultural graduates. Additionally, the university is a leading producer of minority certified public accountants, veterinarians, and psychology undergraduates.NC A&T Points of Pride  , N.C.

Started in 1966 as WANT 620 AM, The campus radio station started with the donation of a refurbished radio console from local radio station WEAL. Because The FCC mandated that college radio stations could not compete with commercial radio, WANT was transmitted out of Price Hall on closed circuit A.M. radio transmitted to strategic buildings on campus via cable. The first day's broadcast carried, in part, remarks from the campus Board of Trustees and then president Lewis C. Dowdy. WANT continued operation until 1979, when the campus station switched to an F.M. format, and became WNAA 90.1 FM. In 1982 the station transitioned from the conventional 18-hour college radio format to a full 24-hour broadcast format, and in 1984 installed a new tower to increase wattage from 10 to its current 10,000 watts of power, being able to broadcast as far as . Today, WNAA is broadcast both over the air and on-line, serving the Greensboro, High Point Winston-Salem metropolitan radio market.

A&T's archrival is North Carolina Central University. Commonly referred to as the "Aggie-Eagle rivalry," this particular rivalry dates back to 1924 and fans from both universities place great emphasis on it. The most-watched event in the rivalry was the 1997 meeting between the two at Carter-Finley Stadium in which over 48,000 spectators watched the Aggies defeat the Eagles 36â7.

Scientists such as Ronald McNair, former NASA Astronaut who perished on the ill-fated Space Shuttle Challenger explosion, graduated magna cum laude from the university with a degree in engineering physics in 1971. Some alumni are notable for being pioneers in their fields, such as Former Chief of the United States Army Nurse Corps Clara Leach Adams-Ender, who was the first woman to receive her master's degree in military arts and sciences from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College and also the first African-American nurse corps officer to graduate from the United States Army War College.
