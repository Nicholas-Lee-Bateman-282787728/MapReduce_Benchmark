   The total number of military and civilian casualties in World War I was over 38 million: there were over 17 million deaths and 20 million wounded, ranking it among the deadliest conflicts in human history. The total number of deaths includes about 11 million military personnel and about 7 million civilians. The Triple Entente (also known as the Allies) lost about 6 million military personnel while the Central Powers lost about 4 million. At least 2 million died from diseases and 6 million went missing, presumed dead. This article lists the casualties of the belligerent powers based on official published sources. About two-thirds of military deaths in World War I were in battle, unlike the conflicts that took place in the 19th century when the majority of deaths were due to disease.  Nevertheless, disease, including the 1918 flu pandemic and deaths while held as prisoners of war, still caused about one third of total military deaths for all belligerents. Casualty statistics for World War I vary to a great extent; estimates of total deaths range from 9 million to over 15 million.Matthew White, Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Primary Megadeaths of the Twentieth Century Military casualties reported in official sources list deaths due to all causes, including an estimated 7 to 8 million combat related deaths (killed or died of wounds) and another two to three million military deaths caused by accidents, disease and deaths while prisoners of war. Official government reports listing casualty statistics were published by the United States and Great Britain.Military Casualties-World War-Estimated," Statistics Branch, GS, War Department, 25 February 1924The War Office, Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire During the Great War 1914–1920 These  secondary sources published during the 1920s, are the source of the statistics in reference works listing casualties in World War One.The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia Spencer C.

More recently the research of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) has revised the military casualty statistics of the U.K. and its allies; they include in their listing of military war dead personnel outside of combat theaters and civilians recruited from Africa, the Middle East and China who provided logistical and service support in combat theaters. The casualties of these support personnel recruited outside of Europe were previously not included with British war dead, however the casualties of the Labour Corps recruited from the British Isles were included in the rolls of British war dead published in 1921."familysearch.org"> The methodology used by each nation to record and classify casualties was not uniform, a general caveat regarding casualty figures is that they cannot be considered comparable in all cases.First World War civilian deaths are "hazardous to estimate" according to Michael Clodfelter who maintains that "the generally accepted figure of noncombatant deaths is 6.5 million."Clodfelter, Michael (2002). Warfare and Armed Conflicts- A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1500–2000 2nd Ed.. ISBN 978-0-7864-1204-4. Page 479 The figures listed below include about 6 million excess civilian deaths due to war related privations, that are often omitted from other compilations of World War I casualties. The war brought about malnutrition and disease caused by the U-boat Campaign and the Blockade of Germany which disrupted trade resulting in food shortages. The civilian deaths in the Ottoman Empire include the Armenian Genocide, Assyrian Genocide and Greek Genocide. Civilian deaths due to the Spanish flu have been excluded from these figures, whenever possible. The figures do not include deaths during the Turkish War of Independence and the Russian Civil War. (when the number of deaths in a country is disputed, a range of war losses is given) (sources and details  of the figures are provided in the footnotes) The war involved multi-ethnic empires such as Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Austro-Hungary and Turkey. Many diverse ethnic groups in these multi-ethnic empires were conscripted for military service. The casualties listed by modern borders are also included in the above table of figures for the countries that existed in 1914. The casualty figures by 1924 post war borders are rough estimates by  Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century, the sources of his figures were published in the Soviet era and in post-Soviet Russia.Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. ISBN 978-5-93165-107-1. The following estimates of Austrian deaths, within contemporary borders, were made by a Russian journalist in a 2015 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead 175,000: including military losses 120,000 with the Austo-Hungarian forces and POW deaths in captivity of 30,000. Civilian dead due to famine and disease were 25,000.Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. Page 36 ISBN 978-5-93165-107-1. The Belgian Congo was part of the Kingdom of Belgium during the war. A Russian journalist Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century based on sources published in the Soviet Union and Russia estimated a total of 155,000 deaths in the Belgian Congo during the war. Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. Page 88 ISBN 978-5-93165-107-1. Czechoslovakia was part of Austro-Hungary during the war. The estimates of Czechoslovak deaths within 1991 borders were made by a Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead 185,000: including military losses 110,000 with the Austro-Hungarian forces and POW deaths in captivity of 45,000.

The Czechoslovak Legions fought with the armies of the Allies during the war.  Estonia was part of the Russian Empire during the war and about 100,000 Estonians served in the Russian Army. Of them about 10,000 were killed.Estonian War Museum – General Laidoner Museum From 1809 Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire until the end of 1917. In 1924 the Finnish government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 26,517 were dead and missing in World War I. The following estimates of deaths, within contemporary borders, during World War I were made by a Russian journalist Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century.

Pages 41 ISBN 978-5-93165-107-1 Ireland was a part of the UK during World War I. Five sixths of the island left to form the Irish Free State, now the Republic of Ireland, in 1922. A total of 206,000 Irishmen served in the British forces during the war.Fergus Campbell, Land and Revolution, Nationalist Politics in the West of Ireland 1891–1921, p196 The number of Irish deaths in the British Army recorded by the registrar general was 27,405.David Fitzpatrick, Militarism in Ireland, 1900–1922, in Tom Bartlet, Keith Jeffreys ed's, p392 A significant number of these casualties were from what, in 1920, became Northern Ireland. While 49,400 soldiers died serving in Irish divisions (the 10th, 16th and 36th), although not all of the men serving in these divisions were natives of Ireland and many Irish who died in non-Irish regiments are not listed.Dúchas The Heritage Service, Visitors Guide to the Gardenshttp://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/irish-soldiers-in-the-first-world-war-who-where-and-how-many-1.1884022 For example, 29% of the casualties in the 16th Division were not natives of Ireland. Neither does it include Irish emigrants in Britain who enlisted there and are not categorised as Irish. Australia lists 4,731 of its first World War soldiers as having been born in Ireland and more than 19,000 Irish-born soldiers served in the Canadian Corps. The rolls do list 30,986 soldiers who were born in Ireland. Prof John Horne of Trinity College Dublin says a figure of between 30,000 and 35,000 Irish war dead is a "conservative" estimate and one likely to rise. The losses of Portuguese Mozambique were estimated by a Russian journalist Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Erlikman's estimates are based on sources published in the Soviet Union and Russia.Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. Pages 59 and 83–99 ISBN 978-5-93165-107-1. 52,000 Poland was an annexed territory of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia, from 1795–1918. By late 1915, Germany had complete control over modern-day Poland. A 2005 Polish study estimated 3,376,800 Poles were conscripted into the armed forces of the occupying powers during World War I, an additional 300,000 were conscripted for forced labor by the Germans. The Russians and Austrians forcibly resettled 1.6 to 1.8 million persons from the war zone in Poland.Andrzej Gawryszewski (2005). Ludnosc Polski w XX wieku. Warsaw. pp. 411–412 According to Michael Clodfelter, Polish war dead were 1,080,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians were killed in the fighting on the Eastern Front; 870,000 men served in the German, Austrian and Russian armies. Another estimate made by a Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century, put total Polish war dead at 640,000, including military losses of 270,000 Poles conscripted, civilian losses of 120,000 due to military operations and 250,000 caused by famine and disease.Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. Pages 49 ISBN 978-5-93165-107-1. The ethnic Polish Blue Army served with the French Army. The ethnic Polish Legions fought as part of the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front. The territory of Transylvania was part of Austria-Hungary during World War I. The following estimates of Romanian deaths, within contemporary borders, during World War I were made by a Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead: 748,000, including military losses of 220,000 with the Romanian forces, 150,000 with the Austro-Hungarian forces and POW deaths in captivity of 48,000. Civilian dead were as follows due to famine and disease: 200,000, killed in military operations 120,000 and 10,000 dead in Austrian prisons.  Britain recruited Indian, Chinese, native South African, Egyptian and other overseas labour to provide logistical support in the combat theatres.Chris Baker www.1914–1918.net The Labour Corps of 1917–1918 Included with British casualties in East Africa are the deaths of 44,911 recruited labourers.Mitchell, T.J.

Of the territory's black African servicemen, 31 were killed in action, 142 died of other causes and 116 were wounded. The following estimates are for Yugoslavia within the 1991 borders. Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Vojvodina (Now part of Serbia) were part of Austria-Hungary during World War I. Serbia, which included Macedonia, and Montenegro were independent nations. The Yugoslav historian Vladimir Dedijer put the total losses of the Yugoslav lands at 1.9 million, of which 43% were from Serbia.Vladimir Dedijer, History of Yugoslavia McGraw-Hill Inc.,US, 1975 ISBN 0-07-016235-2 p. 501 The following estimates of Yugoslav deaths, within 1991 borders, during World War I were made by a Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century.

During WW1, the Nepalese army was expanded and six new regiments, totaling more than 20,000 troops—all volunteers—were sent to India, most of them to the North-West Frontier Province, to release British and Indian troops for service overseas. Simultaneously, the Nepalese government agreed to maintain recruitment at a level that would sustain the existing British Gurkha units and allow the establishment of additional ones. The battalions were increased to thirty-three with the addition of 55,000 new recruits and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command for service on all fronts. Many volunteers were assigned to non-combat units, such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions but they also were in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia. The Rana prime ministers urged Nepalese males to fight in the war. Of the more than 200,000 Nepalese who served in the British army, there were some 20,000 Gurkha casualties included above with the British Indian Army.US Library of Congress A Country Study: Nepal     East Africa Australia  Belgium Canada France Greece India (British) Italy  Japan  Montenegro  New Zealand  Newfoundland  Portugal   Romania  Russian Empire  Serbia  South Africa   United Kingdom :The details by theater of war: :France- 510,821 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 1,524,332  wounded and 236,573 missing (including prisoners). :Italy- 2,081 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 4,689 wounded and 344 missing (including prisoners). :Dardanelles- 16,688 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes", 47,128 wounded and 7,525 missing (including prisoners). : Salonika- 9,668 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes", 16,637 wounded and 2,778  missing (including prisoners). :Mesopotamia- 15,230 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 19,449 wounded and 3,581 missing (including prisoners). :Egypt- 14,763 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 29,434 wounded and  2,951 missing (including prisoners). :East Africa- 1,269 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 534 wounded and 62 missing (including prisoners). :Afghanistan- 120 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 152 wounded and 2 missing (including prisoners). :Russia- 359 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 453 wounded and 143 missing (including prisoners). :Other Theaters- 508 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 461 wounded and 217 missing (including prisoners).

A demographic study  in 1927, put total the war dead for Serbia and Montenegro at 750,000 (300,000 military and 450,000 civilians). The overall population loss from 1912–1920, based on the pre-war level was 1,236,000 persons (including 750,000 in World War I; 150,000 killed in the Balkan Wars and a decline in the number of births of 336,000), in addition there were 47,000 war related deaths during 1914–1920, that are included with deaths by natural causes. According to , Serbian historian Dušan T. Bataković puts their losses at 1,250,000 (450,000 military and 800,000 civilians). These losses are from 1912–1918 and include the Balkan Wars. In July 2014, Serbian poet and academic Matija Bećković said "that 402,435 Serbian soldiers have been killed and 845,000 civilians hanged or exterminated in concentration camps during WWI. At a September 2014 conference sponsored by the Serbian Ministry of Defense, Dr. Alexander Nedok put Serbian war dead at 1,247,435 persons.Serbian  Ministry of Defense website According to the Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis regarding Serbia "it is particularly difficult to ascertain the number of killed". Based on a demographic analysis of the population, Urlanis estimated total Serbian and Montenegrin casualties of 728,000 including military dead: 278,000 (140,000 killed in action; 25,000 died of wounds; 50,000 disease; 60,000 POW and 3,000 from other causes) and total civilian dead of 450,000.Urlanis, Boris (1971). Wars and Population. Moscow Pages 66,79,83, 85,160,171 and 268. In 1924, the Serbian government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 1,008,240 men mobilized and 365,164 dead and missing in World War I. United States War Dept. figures for Serbian casualties are: total mobilized force 707,343; total casualties 331,106 (including killed and died 45,000; wounded 133,148; prisoners and missing 152,958). The report of the U.K. War Office listed military casualties of 331,106 including 45,000 killed, 133,148 wounded and 70,243 prisoners and 82,535 missing. A Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century, estimated 120,000 Serbian civilian deaths due to military activity and 30,000 in Austro-Hungarian prisons. His estimate for total Yugoslav civilian casualties including Austro-Hungarian territory was 550,000. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission figure for South Africa war dead is 9,592. The report of the U.K. War Office listed 7,121 Army war dead, 12,029 wounded and 1,538 taken prisoner. In 1924, the South African government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 136,070 men mobilized and 7,134 dead and missing in World War I. The Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated that included in total South African military deaths are 5,000 killed and died of wounds. Sources for U.K. casualties are divergent and contradictory, there are four published figures for army deaths. One: official figures issued by the British Army in 1921 put their losses at about 673,000 dead and missing from all causes in combat theaters.The Army Council. General Annual Report of the British Army 1912–1919. Parliamentary Paper 1921, XX, Cmd.1193.,PartIV p.&nbsp;62–72 Two: the summary in the 1922 report of the War Office put army and Royal Naval Division dead at 702,410. The authors of the War Office report did not explain the difference between their figures and the official figures issued in 1921 by the British army, however the difference is more than likely due to the inclusion of the Royal Naval Division and deaths outside of combat theaters.Douglas Jerrold, Royal Naval Division (1923) p. 338 The figures for the Royal Naval Division were 7,547 killed and 2,584 died of woundsDumas, Samuel (1923). Losses of Life Caused by War. Oxford. p. 139 "From Dr. T.H.C. Stevenson of the General Register Office, London, I received privately the following figures. There were also about 19,000 deaths among troops not connected with any of the expeditionary forces" Three: the Commonwealth War Graves Commission database available online identifies by name 758,000 army dead, not including the Royal Naval Division. Four: An unofficial compilation of the names of the Army war dead was published by Naval and Military Press in 1998, that put British Army war dead at over 703,000. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission in 2014 listed 887,711 war dead for the U.K. and Colonies. This figure also includes the British Mercantile Marine and conscripted civilian laborers from Africa and Asia. According to The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, their statistics are representative of the number of names commemorated for all servicemen/women whose death was attributable to their war service, they do not list the cause of death for these  casualties. They do not breakout U.K. losses between the British Isles and the various colonies. The website of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission database lists the names of many of the U.K. war dead. Access to the database is open to the general public free of charge. These figures include deaths of forces from the U.K. and Colonies excluding the Dominions and include deaths that occurred after the war up until 31 August 1921. The CWGC figures include military dead outside of combat theaters and civilian  workers conscripted outside of the U.K. in British military service. In 1924, the U.K. government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 5,704,416 men mobilized and 743,702 dead and missing in World War I. The report of the U.K. War Office listed a summary figures from 4 Aug. 1914 up until 31 Dec. 1920 for the army from the  British Isles, not including other colonies of 702,410 war dead, 1,662,625 wounded and 170,389 taken prisoner of war. The War Office report lists those "killed in action; died of wounds; died as prisoners of war and missing officers and other ranks whose deaths have been accepted for official purposes". According to the report these figures include the casualties of the army and the Royal Naval Division.Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire During the Great War 1914–1920, The War Office, p. 237 Reported separately were Royal Navy casualties of 32,287 dead and missing and 5,135 wounded.Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire During the Great War 1914–1920, The War Office, p. 339 These figures do not include an additional 14,661 British Mercantile Marine dead. The casualties from the Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force and Royal Naval Air Service for 1914–18 totaled 6,166 killed, 3,212 missing and 7,245 wounded.H.A. Jones, War In The Air. (Appendices).

The official "final and corrected" casualty figures for British army, including the Territorial Force, were issued on 10 March 1921, in a British parliamentary report. The losses were for the period 4 August 1914 until 30 September 1919, included 573,507 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 254,176 missing and prisoners less 154,308 released prisoners; for a net total of 673,375 dead and missing. There were 1,643,469 wounded also listed in the report. United States War Dept. figures for total British Empire casualties including the U.K. were: total mobilized force 8,904,467; total casualties 3,190,255 (including killed and died: 908,371; wounded: 2,090,212; prisoners and missing 191,652). The Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated that included in total U.K. military deaths are 624,000 killed or missing in action and died of wounds. According to a demographic study, there were 292,000 indirect deaths in the U.K. (109,000 deaths due to wartime privations and 183,000 in the Spanish Flu pandemic). Another estimate of the demographic loss of the civilian population in the U.K. during the war, put total excess deaths at 181,000 not including an additional 100,000 Spanish Flu deaths.Dumas, Samuel (1923). Losses of Life Caused by War. Oxford. p. 151 The 1922 War Office report detailed the deaths of 1,260 civilians and 310 military personnel due to air and sea bombardment of the U.K.Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire During the Great War 1914–1920, The War Office, pp. 674–676 Losses at sea were 908 U.K. civilians and 63 fisherman killed in U-Boat attacks. Overseas labor units serving with the British and French forces. The U.K. employed about 300,000 Indian, Chinese, native South African, Egyptian and other nations as laborers during the war. By the end of 1917, there were 50,000 Chinese workers in France, rising to 96,000 by August 1918 (with another 30,000 working for the French). 100,000 Egyptians were working in France and the Middle East, alongside 21,000 Indians and 20,000 South Africans, who were also in East Africa. A total of about 140,000 Chinese workers recruited in the Beiyang government, served on the Western Front during and after the war with the British and French Armed Forces. According to the Commonwealth war Graves Commission "In all, nearly 2,000 men from the Chinese Labour Corps died during the First World War, some as a direct result of enemy action, or of wounds received in the course of their duties, but many more in the influenza epidemic that swept Europe in 1918–19" One historical controversy is the number who died in the war. Some Chinese scholars say the number was as high as 20,000 but records kept by the British and French recruiters, show just under 2,000 lost their lives, many from the flu pandemic that swept the world starting in 1919. According to the Commonwealrh War Graves Commission, "The African combatant troops raised for the East African campaign numbered 34,000. The non-combatant porters, stevedores and followers of the Military Labour Corps 600,000. Almost 50,000 of these men were lost, killed in action died of sickness or wounds" US Dept. of Defense figures from 2010, list 116,516 war dead from all causes for the period ending Dec. 31, 1918, including 106,378 in the Army, 7,287 in the Navy and 2,851 in the Marine Corps. There were 53,402 battle deaths, including 50,510 in the Army, 431 in the navy and 2,461 in the Marines. There were 63,114 non-combat deaths, 55,868 in the Army, 6,856 in the Navy and 390 in the Marines. Wounded: 204,002 (Army: 193,663, Navy: 819, Marines: 9,520).

The U.K. War Office listed official German figures from 1919 of 720 German civilians who were killed by allied air raids. The figures for civilian deaths due to the Blockade of Germany are disputed. The German Board of Public Health in December 1918 maintained that 763,000 German civilians died from malnutrition and disease caused by the blockade up until the end of December 1918.Germany.

Based on the above-mentioned German study of 1928, they maintained that "A thorough inquiry has led to the conclusion that the number of "civilian" deaths traceable to the war was 424,000, to which number must be added about 200,000 deaths caused by the influenza epidemic". Based on his analysis of the non-published individual World War I campaign histories in the Ottoman Archives, Edward J. Erickson estimated Ottoman military casualties in the study Ordered to Die: A History of the Ottoman Army in the First World War. The casualties included total war dead of 771,844, (243,598 killed in action, 61,487 missing action and 466,759 deaths due to disease).

The total number of resulting Armenian deaths is generally held to have been 1.5 million. Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks.

Men from this area were conscripted into the German forces and their losses are included with German casualties. Over 700 Danish merchant sailors and fisherman died, mostly due to vessels torpedoed by German submarines. Luxembourg remained under German occupation during the war. The government, led by Paul Eyschen, chose to remain neutral. This strategy had the approval of Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. Some citizens were conscripted into the German forces and others escaped to volunteer for the Allies. According to the Mobile Reference travel Guide, 3,700 Luxembourgeois citizens served in the French armed forces and 2,800 gave their lives in the war. They are commemorated at the Gëlle Fra in Luxembourg. Norway was neutral in the war but lost ships and merchant sailors in trading through the war zones. In 1924, the Norwegian government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 1,180 persons dead and missing in World War I. Sweden was neutral in the war but lost ships and merchant sailors in trading through the war zones. In 1924, the Swedish government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 800 persons dead and missing in World War I. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) Annual Report 2013–2014  provides current statistics on the military dead for the British Empire. The war dead totals listed in the report are based on the research by the CWGC to identify and commemorate Commonwealth war dead. The statistics tabulated by The Commonwealth War Graves Commission are representative of the number of names commemorated for all servicemen/women of the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth and former UK Dependencies, whose death was attributable to their war service. Some auxiliary and civilian organizations are also accorded war grave status if death occurred under certain specified conditions. For the purposes of CWGC the dates of inclusion for Commonwealth War Dead are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921. Total World War I dead were 1,116,371 (UK and former colonies 887,711; Undivided India 73,895; Canada 64,997; Australia 62,123; New Zealand 18,053; South Africa 9,592).

Tucker Garland Publishing, New York  1999 978-0-8153-3351-7John Ellis, The World War I Databook, Aurum Press, 2001 ISBN 1854107666 pp. 269–70 The War Office report puts the number of "soldiers who lost their lives" from the British Regular Army and Royal Naval Division at 702,410. This is not in agreement with the "final and corrected" figures in the 1921 report for the army published in the General Annual Report of the British Army 1912–1919, which put British Army dead and missing at 673,375 and the official compilation of Army war dead published in 1921 that put total losses at about 673,000.Soldiers died in the great war, 1914–1919, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1920–1921 The War Office report did not explain the reason for this discrepancy; the difference is more than likely due to their inclusion of the Royal Naval Division and deaths outside of combat theaters.
