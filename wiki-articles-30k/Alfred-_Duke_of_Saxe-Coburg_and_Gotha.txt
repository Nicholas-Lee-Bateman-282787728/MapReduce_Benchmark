      Alfred,  (Alfred Ernest Albert; 6 August 1844 – 30 July 1900) reigned as Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 1893 to 1900. He was the second son and fourth child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was known as the Duke of Edinburgh from 1866 until he succeeded his paternal uncle Ernest II as the reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in the German Empire. Alfred was born at Windsor Castle to the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, and her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the second son of Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. As a son of the British monarch, he was styled His Royal Highness The Prince Alfred at birth and was second in the line of succession behind his elder brother, The Prince of Wales. He was known to his family as "Affie", after a childhood mispronunciation of the name "Alfred". Alfred was christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Howley, at the Private Chapel in Windsor Castle on 6 September 1844. His godparents were his mother's first cousin, Prince George of Cambridge (represented by his father, The Duke of Cambridge); his paternal aunt, the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (represented by his maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Kent); and Queen Victoria's half-brother, Carl, Prince of Leiningen (represented by The Duke of Wellington, Conservative Leader in the Lords). Alfred studied violin at Holyrood, Edinburgh, where his accompanist was Hungarian expatriate George Lichtenstein. In 1856 it was decided that Prince Alfred, in accordance with his own wishes, should enter the Royal Navy. A separate establishment was accordingly assigned to him, with Lieutenant Sowell, R. E., as governor. He passed the examination in August 1858, and was appointed as midshipman in  at the age of 14. In July 1860, while in this ship, he paid an official visit to the Cape Colony, and made a very favourable impression both on the colonials and on the native chiefs. He took part in a hunt at Hartebeeste-Hoek, resulting in the slaughter of large numbers of game animals."Progress of His Royal Highness, Prince Alfred Ernest Albert, through the Cape Colony, British Kaffraria, the Orange Free State, and Port Natal in the year 1860" On the abdication of King Otto of Greece, in 1862, Prince Alfred was chosen to succeed him, but the British government blocked plans for him to ascend the Greek throne, largely because of the Queen's opposition to the idea. She and her late husband had plans for him to succeed to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg. Prince Alfred, therefore, remained in the navy, and was promoted to lieutenant on 24 February 1863, serving under Count Gleichen on the corvette .Heathcote, p. 9 He was promoted to captain on 23 February 1866 and was appointed to the command of the frigate  in January 1867. Alfred remained second-in-line to the British throne from his birth until 8 January 1864, when his older brother Edward and his wife Alexandra of Denmark had their first son Prince Albert Victor. Any legitimate children of his older brother took priority in the succession list. Alfred became third-in-line to the throne and as Edward and Alexandra continued to have children, Alfred was further demoted in the order of succession. In the Queen's Birthday Honours on 24 May 1866,Yvonne's Royalty: Peerage the Prince was created Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Ulster, and Earl of Kent, with an annuity of £15,000 granted by Parliament. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 8 June. While still in command of the Galatea, the Duke of Edinburgh started from Plymouth on 24 January 1867 for his voyage round the world. On 7 June 1867, he left Gibraltar, reached the Cape of Good Hope on 24 July and paid a royal visit to Cape Town on 24 August 1867 after landing at Simon's Town a while earlier. He landed at Glenelg, South Australia, on 31 October. Being the first member of the royal family to visit Australia, the Duke was received with great enthusiasm. During his stay of nearly five months he visited Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Tasmania. Adelaide school Prince Alfred College was named in his honour to mark such an occasion. On 12 March 1868, on his second visit to Sydney, he was invited by Sir William Manning, President of the Sydney Sailors' Home, to picnic at the beachfront suburb of Clontarf to raise funds for the home. At the function he was wounded in the back by a revolver fired by Henry James O'Farrell. The Prince was shot just to the right of his spine, and was tended for the next two weeks by six nurses, trained by Florence Nightingale and led by Matron Lucy Osburn, who had just arrived in Australia in February 1868. In the violent struggle during which the Duke was shot, William Vial had managed to wrest the gun away from O'Farrell until bystanders assisted. Vial, a master of a Masonic Lodge, had helped to organise the picnic in honour of the Duke's visit and was presented with a gold watch for securing the life of the Duke. Another bystander, George Thorne, was wounded in the foot by O'Farrell's second shot.  On the evening of 23 March 1868, the most influential people of Sydney voted for a memorial building to be erected, "to raise a permanent and substantial monument in testimony of the heartfelt gratitude of the community at the recovery of HRH". This led to a public subscription which paid for the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital's construction. Prince Alfred soon recovered from his injury and was able to resume command of his ship and return home in early April 1868. Henry James O'Farrell was arrested at the scene, quickly tried, convicted and hanged on 21 April 1868. Prince Alfred reached Spithead on 26 June 1868, after an absence of seventeen months. He visited Hawaii in 1869 and spent time with the royal family there, where he was presented with leis upon his arrival. He was also the first member of the Royal Family to visit New Zealand, arriving in 1869 on . The Duke of Edinburgh also became the first European prince to visit Japan and on 4 September 1869, he was received at an audience by the teenaged Emperor Meiji in Tokyo.  The Duke's next voyage was to India, where he arrived in December 1869 and Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]), which he visited the following year. In both countries and at Hong Kong, which he visited on the way, he was the first British prince to set foot in the country. The native rulers of India vied with one another in the magnificence of their entertainments during the Duke's stay of three months. In Ceylon the royal guest was feasted on gold plates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Prins|first=Stephen |title=The day the Queen came to Queen’s Road|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/131110/plus/the-day-the-queen-came-to-queens-road-68490.html|publisher=Sunday Times|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Boyle |first=Richard |title=A right royal tour|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/980927/plus2.html|publisher=Sunday Times|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Amerasinghe|first=Dr. A.R.B.|title=Bagatelle Road – will it be gone with the wind?|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/110828/News/nws_049.html|publisher=[[Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)]]|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref>  ==Marriage== On 23 January 1874, the Duke of Edinburgh married the [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia]], the second (and only surviving) daughter of [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II of Russia]] and his wife [[Marie of Hesse and by Rhine]], daughter of [[Ludwig II, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine]] and [[Wilhelmine of Baden]], at the [[Winter Palace]], [[St Petersburg]].

The marriage, however, was not a happy one, and the bride was thought haughty by London Society. She was surprised to discover that she had to yield precedence to the Princess of Wales and all of Queen Victoria's daughters and insisted on taking precedence before the Princess of Wales (the future Queen Alexandra) because she and her father the Tsar considered the Princess of Wales' family (the Danish Royal Family) as inferior to their own. Queen Victoria refused this demand, yet granted her precedence immediately after the Princess of Wales. Her father gave her the then-staggering sum of £100,000 as a dowry, plus an annual allowance of £28,000.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}  ==Issue== {{Further|Grandchildren of Victoria and Albert}} <br> {| border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;" |- style="background:#cccccc;" !Image!!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes |- |align=center| [[File:Erbprinz-alfred-von-sachsen-coburg-gotha.jpg|90px]] || [[Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred <br />("Young Affie")]]||15 October 1874||6 February 1899||Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 22 August 1893 |- |align=center| [[File:MarieRoumanie.jpg|90px]] || [[Marie of Romania|Princess Marie <br />("Missy")]]||29 October 1875||18 July 1938||married, 10 January 1893, [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand I of Romania]] (1865–1927); had issue |- |align=center| [[File:Vitoria Melita.JPG|90px]] || [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Princess Victoria Melita <br />("Ducky")]]||25 November 1876||2 March 1936||married (1), 19 April 1894, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse|Ernst Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine]]; had issue; divorced 21 December 1901 (2) 8 October 1905, [[Kirill Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia]]; had issue |- |align=center| [[File:Alexandrabritain1878.jpeg|90px]] || [[Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Princess Alexandra <br />("Sandra")]]||1 September 1878||16 April 1942||married, 20 April 1896, [[Ernst II, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]]; had issue |- |align=center| [[File:Beatriceedinburgh1884.jpg|90px]] || [[Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Princess Beatrice]]||20 April 1884||13 July 1966||married, 15 July 1909, [[Infante Alfonso, Duke of Galliera|Infante Alfonso of Spain, 3rd Duke of Galliera]]; had issue |}  ==Flag rank== The Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in [[Malta]] for several years and his third child, [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Victoria Melita]], was born there in 1876.
