   Alan Walbridge Ladd (September 3, 1913&nbsp;– January 29, 1964) was an American actor and film and television producer. Ladd found success in film the 1940s and early 1950s, particularly in Westerns such as Shane (1953) and film noirs where he was often paired with Veronica Lake, such as This Gun for Hire (1942), The Glass Key (1942) and The Blue Dahlia (1946). Other notable credits include Two Years Before the Mast (1946), Whispering Smith (1949) and The Great Gatsby (1949). His popularity diminished in the late 1950s, though he continued to appear in popular films until his accidental death due to a lethal combination of alcohol, a barbiturate, and two tranquilizers.Obituary Variety, February 5, 1964, page 63. Ladd was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas on 3 September 1913. He was the only child of Ina Raleigh (also known as Selina Rowley) (b 25 November 1888), and Alan Ladd, a freelance accountant.http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2767 His mother was English, from County Durham, and had migrated to the USA in 1907 when she was nineteen. His father died of a heart attack when Ladd was four. On 3 July 1918 a young Alan accidentally burnt down the family home while playing with matches. His mother relocated to Oklahoma City, where she married Jim Beavers, a housepainter (d 1936).Linet p 4-5 In the early 1920s an economic downturn led to the family moving to California, a journey which took four months. They lived in a migrant camp in Pasadena at first before moving to the San Fernando Valley where Beavers went to work at FBO Studios as a painter.Linet p9-10 Ladd enrolled in North Hollywood High School on 18 February 1930. He became a high school swimming and diving champion and participated in high school dramatics in his senior year, including the role of "Koko" in The Mikado. His diving skills led to his appearance in an aquatic show, Marinella.BANDIT RAIDS WATER OFFICE: Clerk in North Hollywood Menaced With Gun Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 20 July 1933: A16. His role in The Mikado had been seen by a talent scout.

The contract had options which could go for seven years, but they were all in the studio's favor. Ladd appeared unbilled in a film, Once in a Lifetime (1932), but the studio eventually decided Ladd was too blond and too short and dropped him after six months. (All of Ladd's fellow "discoveries" would be dropped, including a young Tyrone Power.)Fine Broth of a Ladd! Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) [Chicago, Ill] 19 Sep 1943: B5. Ladd graduated from high school on 1 February 1934, aged twenty years old.Linet p 15 He worked in the advertising department of the San Fernando Sun Valley Record, eventually becoming the newspaper's ad manager. When the paper changed hands Ladd lost his job. He sold cash registers and borrowed $150 to open up his own hamburger and malt shop across from his old high school, which he called Tiny's Patio (his nickname at high school was "Tiny"). However he was ultimately unable to make a success of the shop. In another attempt to break into the film industry, Ladd went to work at Warner Bros as a grip, and ended up staying two years. He was injured falling off a scaffold and decided to quit.San Fernando Valley Will Be Ladd's Home: Ladd's Hedge Is a Rancho The Washington Post (1923-1954) [Washington, D.C] 11 May 1947: S5 He managed to save and borrow enough money to attend an acting school run by Ben Bard, who had taught him when he was under contract at Universal. Ladd wound up appearing in several stage productions for Bard."Alan Ladd Urges Training for Films", Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 28 May 1950: D1. Bard later recalled Ladd "was such a shy guy he just wouldn't speak up loud and strong. I had to get him lower his voice too, it was too high. I also insisted that he get himself a decent set of dentures."[ ] In 1936 Ladd played an unbilled role in Pigskin Parade. He had short term stints at MGM and RKO, but only got regular professional acting work when he turned to radio. Ladd's rich, deep voice was ideal for that medium and in 1936 he ended up being signed by station KFWB as their sole radio actor. He stayed for three years at KFWB doing up to 20 shows a week."The Gent Is Alan Ladd, the Calculating Trigger-Man in 'This Gun for Hire'" by John R. Franchey. New York Times 7 June 1942: X4.  Ladd was playing the roles of a father and son on radio one night when heard by the agent Sue Carol (b 30 October 1903). She was impressed and called the station to talk to the actors and was told it was the one person. She arranged to meet him and impressed by his looks she signed him to her books and enthusiastically promoted her new client in films as well as radio, starting with the 1939 film Rulers of the Sea (1939), in which he played a character named "Colin Farrell" at $250 a week.Linet p 40 He also received attention for a small part in Hitler - Beast of Berlin (1939). Ladd tested unsuccessfully for the lead in Golden Boy (1939) but obtained many small roles, such as the serial The Green Hornet (1940), Her First Romance (1940), The Black Cat (1941) and the Disney film The Reluctant Dragon (1941). Most notably he had a small part in Citizen Kane, playing a newspaper reporter towards the end of the film. Ladd's career then gained extra momentum when he was cast in a featured role in the wartime thriller Joan of Paris, 1942. It was only a small part but it involved a touching death scene which brought him attention within the industry.Alan Ladd 8/12 RKO would eventually offer Ladd a contract at $400 a week. However he would soon receive a better offer over at Paramount.  Paramount had owned the film rights to Graham Greene's novel, A Gun for Sale since 1936 but only decided to make a movie in 1941, changing the title to This Gun for Hire. Director Frank Tuttle was struggling to find a new actor to play the role of "Raven", a hitman with a conscienc. Ladd auditioned successfully and Paramount signed him to a long term contract in September 1941 for $300 a week.SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOOD: ' Pied Piper,' Novel by Nevil Shute, Purchased by Fox -- Harold Shuster to Direct RIALTO FILM IS HELD OVER ' Badlands of Dakota' to Begin a Second Week -- Swedish Program Opens Today By DOUGLAS W.

The New York Times reported shortly afterwards that: Tuttle and the studio are showing more than a passing enthusiasm for Ladd. He has been trying to get a foothold in pictures for eight years but received no encouragement although he tried every angle known to town - extra work, bit parts, stock contracts, dramatic schools, assault of the casting offices.

Ladd's calm slender ferocity make it clear that he was the first American actor to show the killer as a cold angel." – David Thomson (A Biographical Dictionary of Film, 1975) Alan Ladd Both the film and Ladd's performance played an important role in the development of the "gangster" genre: "That the old fashioned motion picture gangster with his ugly face, gaudy cars, and flashy clothes was replaced by a smoother, better looking, and better dressed bad man was largely the work of Mr. Ladd." – New York Times obituary (January 30, 1964). Ladd was teamed with actress Veronica Lake in this film, and despite the fact that it was Robert Preston who played the romantic lead, the Ladd-Lake pairing captured the public's imagination, and would continue in another three films. (They appeared in a total of seven films together, but three were only guest shots in all-star musical revues.) Even during the filming of This Gun for Hire Paramount knew they had a potential star and announced Ladd's next film, an adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's story The Glass Key. This had been a successful vehicle for George Raft several years earlier and Paramount wanted "a sure-fire narrative to carry him on his way."Warners Cement Deal for Rogers' Biography: Alan Ladd Build-up Set Stars Named for 'Harvest' 20th Bids for De Fore 'Sunday Punch' Slated Rita Piazza to Do Play Schallert, Edwin.

The majority of stars were earmarked as such when they appeared on the horizon - from Broadway or from wherever they came; if it seemed unlikely that public acceptance would come with one film they were trained and built up: the incubation period was usually between two and five years. As far as Ladd was concerned, he was a small-part actor given a fat part faute de mieux and after his second film for them he had not merely hit the leading-men category, but had gone beyond it to films which were constructed around his personality.Shipman p 338 Ladd then appeared in a lighter vehicle, Lucky Jordan (1943), with Helen Walker, playing a gangster who tries to get out of war service and tangles with Nazis.

According to Shipman: It was a pitch to sell Ladd to women filmgoers, though he had not changed one iota and he did not have a noticeable romantic aura. But Paramount hoped that women might feel that beneath the rock-like expression there msouldered fires of passion, or something like. His black-lashed eyes, however, gave nothing away; it was 'take me as I am' or 'I'm the boss around here'. He never flirted nor even seemed interested (which is one of the reasons he and Lake were so effective together).Shipman p 339 In March 1944 Ladd took another physical and was re-classified 1A.

He followed this with a melodrama with Farrow, Beyond Glory (1948), which featured Audie Murphy in his film debut (and was released before Whispering Smith). "Top Grossers of 1947", Variety, 7 January 1948 p 63 Ever since he had become a star, Ladd continued to appear in radio, usually in dramatisations of feature films for such shows as Lux Radio Theatre and Screen Directors Playhouse. He created roles played both by himself, but also other actors, including the part of Rick Blaine in an adaptation of Casablanca. In 1948 he starred and produced a regular weekly series for syndication, Box 13, which ran for 52 episodes. Ladd's next role was a significant change of pace, playing Jay Gatsby in the 1949 version of The Great Gatsby, written and produced by Richard Maibaum. This film had been planned since 1946, but production was delayed due to a combination of difficulties with the censor, and Paramount reluctance for Ladd to play such a challenging part. It was not a big success at the box office and its mixed critical and commercial reception caused Ladd to shy away from serious dramatic roles afterwards. His next films were more typical fare: Chicago Deadline, playing a tough reporter; Captain Carey, U.S.A., as a vengeful ex-OSS agent, for Maibaum; and Appointment with Danger, as a postal inspector investigating a murder with the help of nun Phyllis Calvert (shot in 1949 but not be released until 1951).

ISBN 0-8090-5170-2 Ladd and Veronica Lake became a particularly popular pairing because, at 5'1", she was one of the few Hollywood actresses shorter than him. In his memoirs, actor/producer John Houseman wrote of Ladd: "Since he himself was extremely short, he had only one standard by which he judged his fellow players: their height". To compensate for Ladd's height, during the filming of Boy on a Dolphin, co-starring the much taller Sophia Loren, the cinematographer used special low stands to light Ladd and the crew built a ramp system of heavy planks to enable the two actors to stand at equal eye level. In outdoor scenes, trenches were dug for Loren to stand in. For the film Saskatchewan, director Raoul Walsh had a six-inch hole dug for co-star Hugh O'Brian to stand in, while using the excavated dirt to build a mound for Ladd to stand on, thereby overcoming the one-foot disparity in height.
