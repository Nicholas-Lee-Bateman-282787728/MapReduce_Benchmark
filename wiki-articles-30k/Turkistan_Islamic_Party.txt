     The Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) Turkistan Islam Partisi () Ḥizb al-Islāmī al-Turkistānī () or Ḥizb al-Islāmī li-Turkistān (), or in Turkish: Türkistan İslam Cemaati (Turkistan Islam Jamaat) or Türkistan İslam Partisi, or East Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIP) (حزب الإسلام لتركستان الشرقية), formerly known as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) (), and other names, is an Islamic terrorist and separatist organization founded by Uyghur militants in western China. Its stated goals are the independence of East Turkestan from China, the establishment of an Islamic state across the entire Central Asia and a caliphate. According to the Chinese government, it is a violent separatist movement and is often responsible for terrorist attacks in Xinjiang. According to Chinese report, published in 2002, between 1990 to 2001 ETIM had reportedly committed over 200 acts of terrorism, resulting in at least 162 deaths and over 440 injuries. Since the September 11 attacks, the group has been designated as a terrorist organization by Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, United Arab Emirates, China, and the United States."U.S.Department of State Terrorist Exclusion List"(Retrieved on 29 July 2014).   "1- Who are we?  We are a group of workers for Islam and the Mujahideen for the cause of Allah to save the worshipers from the worshiping of worshipers [so that they can] worship the lord of the worshipers all over [the world] in general and Turkistan in particular. [This group] arose so that its members could cooperate on tawhid and purity and Allah-fearing and jihad for the cause of Allah, so as to liberate East Muslim Turkistan from the infidel Communist Chinese invasion and repulsing its invasion from religion of the Muslims and their honor and souls and money so as to establish Allah's pure religion, and empowering the Islamic Shari'a in Turkistan, and cooperate with the Mujahideen Muslims in the name of Allah all over the Muslim world to restore the wise Islamic caliphate and empower Allah's Shari'ah on the world." - Charter of the Turkistan Islamic Party - The Media Center of the Turkistan Islamic Party.   "Third: Working and cooperating with all the Jihadi groups for the cause of Allah everywhere, so as to repulse the invasion of the infidel from them, and establishing Allah's Shar'iah everywhere. "Say thou: 'This is my way: I do invite unto Allah,- on evidence clear as the seeing with one's eyes,- I and whoever follows me. Glory to Allah. and never will I join gods with Allah.'" {Yusuf :108}" - Charter of the Turkistan Islamic Party - The Media Center of the Turkistan Islamic Party.   "If you do not wage jihad, you will never be able to get rid of the oppression of the infidels which makes you abandon the religion and which makes slaves of you. Thus, you will not be able to be rescued from the oppression of this world and the torments of the hereafter, or find eternal happiness until you return to the religion of Allah. . ." - Abdul Haq (Memetiming Memeti), a commander in the Uyghur separatist movement Turkistan Islamic Party (East Turkestan Islamic Movement), from a video released by TIP, February 9. 2009.   "We are, Allah-willing, proceeding along this path with all of our strength in order to rescue our oppressed brothers in East Turkistan – and Allah-willing, we are working on rescuing our oppressed brothers from the hands of the Communists until we make Allah’s religion supreme and we live a precious life in the shadow of Islamic Shariah law, or else be rewarded with martyrdom in the cause of Allah We are plotting for the Chinese to suffer the torture of Allah, or else by our hands " - Abdul Haq, leader of the Uyghur separatist movement Turkistan Islamic Party (East Turkestan Islamic Movement), from "Steadfastness and Preparations for Jihad in the Cause of Allah." Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP), January 20, 2009.   "Anyone who is familiar with the battles that the mujahideen are engaged in today will know that the path of Jihad is the only path to prevent attacks and injustice [against us]... and, the suffering of the Americans is on the rise in Iraq due to the operations of the mujahideen...  As a result of these operations, America was forced to withdraw fr om Iraq, and still it has not learned its lesson. Today, it is once again drinking [from] the cup of  failure in Afghanistan as it gasps for breath, [looking] to avoid defeat and withdrawal—and now it is fighting the dizziness of death. Those kind of results could never have been achieved with writings and speeches." "Meanwhile, with regards to the situation in East  Turkestan which was once part of the Islamic  nation and is now under the domination of the unjust infidel Communists, the confrontation is still ongoing between the mujahideen and the invading occupiers.  And, Allah-willing, the operations of the mujahideen in East Turkestan  will make the Chinese suffer just as America  suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan, from shame, sc andal, and defeat...  In  1997, the mujahideen of East Turkestan gathered under the leadership of Commander Hasan Mahsum beyond the  borders of our land, and they were graced by ch oosing the path of training within the shadow of  the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan— as they were prohibited and forbidden from doing so in their  own country because of the Chinese occupation.  We used to be able to live in our land, and we  knew the ways of living, but we abandoned ou r homes in order to support the oppressed and to remove the injustices committed against all Muslims. [We left] in order to try and gain our sovereignty from communist China, and for the sake of providing our people a carefree and  happy existence under the shadow of the Quran and Sunnah. During this period of time, a large number of mujahideen from East Turkestan received  training... Later, during this critical period, the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan was destroyed at the hands of the Zionist-Crusader assault launched under the lead of America... Nonetheless, the mujahideen of East Turkestan were able  to continue their jihadi operations even after the collapse of the Islamic Emirate, thanks be to  Allah." - TIP Narrator, from "Steadfastness and Preparations for Jihad in the Cause of Allah." Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP), January 20, 2009.   "We have to conquer our own country and purify it of all infidels. Then, we should conquer the infidels’ countries and spread Islam. The infidels who are usurping our countries have announced war against Islam and Muslims, forcing Muslims to abandon Islam and change their beliefs." - Abdullah Mansour, leader of the Uyghur separatist movement Turkistan Islamic Party (East Turkestan Islamic Movement), from "The Duty of Faith and Support," Voice of Islam/al-Fajr Media Center, August 26, 2009.   The area known as Xinjiang had been a protectorate of China as early as 60 BC during the Han dynasty when it was part of the Protectorate of the Western Regions and also a protectorate of Tang dynasty China when it was part of the Protectorate General to Pacify the West, though there are numerous periods of independence from China. The historical area of what is modern day Xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the Tarim Basin and Dzungaria, and was originally populated by Indo-European Tocharian and Iranic Saka peoples who practiced the Buddhist religion. The area was subjected to Turkification and Islamification at the hands of invading Turkic Muslims during the Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang. In the 18th century the Qing Dynasty reorganized the territory as a province, Xinjiang. Yet, Russian influence was strong. Russian Orthodox Old Believers emigrated from Russia to Xinjiang in the early 19th century, and the Russian Civil War accelerated this immigration by adding white émigrés. During China's warlord era in the 1910s-1920s, the Soviet Union propped up the separatist Second East Turkestan Republic, and only accepted Chinese rule when the Chinese communists established the People's Republic of China after the Chinese Civil War. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union distributed Soviet passports among the Central Asian ethnics in Xinjiang to facilitate emigration to Kazakh SSR. After the Sino-Soviet split, the Soviet Union amassed troops on the Russian border with Xinjiang, and bolstered "East Turkestan" separatist movements, which received moral and material support from other regional militant groups. China accused the Soviets of engineering riots, and improved the military infrastructure there to combat it.  "Our group, the Turkistan Islamic Party, is a group established as a continuation of the East Turkistan Jihad Movement in the year of 1989 under the unique leadership of Ziyauddin Yusuf." - Abdul Haq (Memetiming Memeti), a commander in the Uyghur separatist movement Turkistan Islamic Party (East Turkestan Islamic Movement).  Abdul Hameed, Abdul Azeez Makhdoom, and Hakeem Makhdoom launched the Islamic Party of Turkistan (حزب الإسلام لتركستان) (Hizbul Islam Li-Turkistan) in 1940. After being set free from prison in 1979, Abdul Hakeem instructed Hasan Mahsum and other Uyghurs in fundamentalist Islam. In 1989 Ziyauddin Yusuf (pronounced Zeydin Yusup in Uyghur) started the group which was originally called East Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIP) in Arabic as (حزب الإسلام لتركستان الشرقية) Hizbul Islam Li-Turkistan Ash-Sharqiyah. The name in Uyghur was (شەرقىي تۈركىستان ئىسلام پارتىيىسى) Sharki Turkistan Islam Partisi, and in Turkish it was called Doğu Türkistan İslam Partisi. Hasan Mahsum and Abudukadir Yapuquan reorganized the movement in 1997, in the same form that it exists today. This group was referred to as "East Turkestan Islamic Movement" (ETIM) by the Chinese government but the group itself never used that name. In 1998 Mahsum moved ETIM's headquarters to Kabul, taking shelter under Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, ETIM leaders met with Osama bin Laden and other leaders of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan to coordinate actions. There, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement dropped the "East" from its name as it increased its domain. The group's infrastructure was crippled after the United States invaded Afghanistan and bombed Al Qaeda bases in the mountainous regions along the border with Pakistan, during which the leader of ETIM, Hasan Mahsum, was killed. However, ETIM resurged after the Iraq War inflamed mujaheddin sentiment. It expanded its portfolio to attacks on United States interests, such as the U.S. embassy in Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan). The United States Department of State responded by listing it as a terrorist organization. This greatly weakened ETIM, as it lost sympathy from many Western organizations who would otherwise support its struggle against China. Nonetheless, ETIM circulated a video in 2006 calling for a renewed jihad, and took advantage of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing to gain publicity for its attacks.  The ETIM is said to be allied with the Pakistani Taliban (Tehreek i Taliban Pakistan) leading Pakistan being seriously urged by China to take action against militants. The new organization called itself the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) and abandoned usage of the name ETIM, although China still calls it by the name ETIM and refuses to acknowledge it as TIP. The Turkistan Islamic Party was originally subordinated to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) but then split off and declared its name as TIP and started making itself known by promoting itself with its Islamic Turkistan magazine and Voice of Islam media in Chinese, Arabic, Russian, and Turkish in order to reach out to global jihadists. Control over the Uyghur and Uzbek militants was transferred to the Pakistani Taliban from the Afghan Taliban after 2001, so violence against the militant's countries of origins can no longer restrained by the Afghan Taliban since the Pakistani Taliban does not have a stake in doing so.http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/religion-geopolitics/glossary/taliban TIP's Ṣawt al-Islām (Voice of Islam) media arm has released many video messages. The full name of their media center is "Turkistan Islamic Party Voice of Islam Media Center" Uyghur: (تۈركىستان ئىسلام پارتىيىسى ئىسلام ئاۋازى تەشۋىقات مەركىزى) Arabic: («المركز الإعلامي للحزب الإسلامي التركستاني «صوت الإسلام). The Uyghur East Turkestan Islamic Movement's magazine Islamic Turkistan has accused the Chinese "Muslim Brotherhood" Yihewani of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining terrorist jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the "infidel Chinese" language is the language of the Hui. The NEFA Foundation, an American terrorist analyst foundation, translated and released a jihad article from ETIM, whose membership it said consisted primarily of "Uyghur Muslims from Western China." The East Turkestan Islamic Movement's primary goal is the independence of East Turkestan. ETIM continues this theme of contrasting "Muslims" and "Chinese", in a six-minute video in 2008, where "Commander Seyfullah" warns Muslims not to bring their children to the 2008 Summer Olympics, and also saying "do not stay on the same bus, on the same train, on the same plane, in the same buildings, or any place the Chinese are". Terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna has said that ETIM is closely associated with the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), and that there are "many sympathizers and supporters" of ETIM in the WUC. China has accused the WUC of orchestrating the 2009 ethnic violence in Urumqi; similarly, Gunaratna said that one of ETIM's aims is to "fuel hatred" and violence between the Han and the Uyghur ethnic groups, adding that it represented a threat to China and the Central Asia region as a whole. In October 2008, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security released a list of eight terrorists linked to ETIM, including some of the leadership, with detailed charges. They are: The East Turkestan Islamic Movement (Turkistan Islamic Party) is allied with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan along with the Pakistani Taliban (Tehreek i Taliban Pakistan)Potter 2013, p. 74. and Al-Qaeda.Potter 2013, pp. 71-74.FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS p. 237. One of the grievances against China by the TIP was that China implemented female and male equality. Al Qaeda appointed TIP (ETIM) member Abdul Haq al Turkistani to their Shura Majlis. Al Qaeda also appointed TIP (ETIM) member Abdul Shakoor Turkistani as military commander of their forces in the FATA region of Pakistan. Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a statement supporting Jihad in Xinjiang against Chinese, in the Caucasus against the Russians and naming Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan as places of warfare. Zawahiri endorsed "jihad to liberate every span of land of the Muslims that has been usurped and violated, from Kashgar to Andalusia, and from the Caucasus to Somalia and Central Africa". Uyghurs inhabit Kashgar, the city which was mentioned by Zawahiri. Zawahiri released another statement, saying : "My mujahideen brothers in all places and of all groups ... we face aggression from America, Europe, and Russia ... so it's up to us to stand together as one from East Turkestan to Morocco".https://twitter.com/Dogu_Turkistan_/status/662668079319633920 TIP released an image showing Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri meeting with Hasan Mahsum, the original and first leader of the Turkistan Islamic Party.https://twitter.com/Dogu_Turkistan_/status/644269919492698112 For a while after he died, Osama bin Laden's successor was believed by some to be the ETIM leader Abdul Shakoor Turkistani because jihadist organizations have been powerfully influenced by ETIM. TIP (ETIM) issued a eulogy for Doku Umarov of the Caucasian Emirate upon his death.http://videos.videopress.com/pwl0YeDc/abd-allah-mane1b9a3c5abr-22eulogy-for-the-amc4abr-abc5ab-e28098uthmc481n-dokku-umarov22_dvd.mp4http://i2.wp.com/videos.videopress.com/pwl0YeDc/abd-allah-mane1b9a3c5abr-22eulogy-for-the-amc4abr-abc5ab-e28098uthmc481n-dokku-umarov22_dvd.original.jpg Al-Qaeda ideologue Mustafa Setmariam Nasar wrote in support of the East Turkestan Independence Movement. In 2006 Kavkaz Center reported that Al-Qaeda media arm Al-Fajr released a video urging Muslims to go on Jihad in support of the East Turkestan Independence Movement. Al-Qaeda member Abu Yahya al-Libi spoke in support of "Jihad" in "East Turkestan" against China.http://raffaellopantucci.com/2011/06/24/turkistan-islamic-party-video-attempts-to-explain-uyghur-militancy-to-chinese/ Islamist Hani al-Sibai spoke in support of the East Turkestan Independence Movement.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe-HDl2V5Vg Hani al-Sibai : East Turkistan (هاني السباعي : تركستان الشرقية ) The Turkistan Islamic Party issued condolences for Taliban leader Mullah Omar upon his death.https://azelin.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/e1b8a5izb-al-islc481mc4ab-al-turkistc481nc4ab-in-bilc481d-al-shc481m-22concering-the-death-of-mullc481-mue1b8a5mmad-umar22.pdfhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLb-InuWgAEgCha.jpg With the goal of establishing a Central Asian Islamic state, Uyghurs, Chechens, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kyrgyz Kazakhs, and other ethnicities flocked to serve under Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan leader Juma Namangani.http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/01/14/theyre-only-sleeping During the Battle of Kunduz in Afghanistan, foreign Islamist militants like Uyghurs, Chechens, Rohingya, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, and Uzbeks joined the Taliban in the attack.http://www.dw.com/en/who-is-fighting-in-northern-afghanistan/a-18765739http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34406648http://www.rferl.org/content/afghanistan-kunduz-taliban-offensive-foreign-fighters/26993864.htmlhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/world/a-taliban-prize-won-in-a-few-hours-after-years-of-strategy.html?_r=0http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/afghan-us-force-back-taliban-in-kunduz/story-e6frg6so-1227552951441http://tvnewsroom.org/newslines/world/taliban-say-pulling-back-from-centre-of-kunduz-but-can-return-162795/ The Pakistani Army's Operation Zarb-e-Azb appears to have driven these foreign militants from Pakistan's northwestern area of Waziristan into Afghanistan.http://www.firstpost.com/world/behind-the-capture-of-kunduz-heres-why-pakistan-was-behind-talibans-victory-2466780.htmlhttp://www.firstpost.com/world/is-kunduz-the-victory-isi-wanted-for-puppet-taliban-chief-mullah-mansoor-2466780.htmlhttp://www.asianage.com/columnists/kunduz-warning-shot-across-afghan-bows-465http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/opinion/07-Oct-2015/beyond-the-fall-of-kunduz Non-Afghan militants like Arabs, Tajiks, Chechens, Uyghurs, Uzbeks, and Pakistanis make up 40% of anti-government fighters in Afghanistan according to Dawlat Waziri, a member of the Defense Ministry of Afghanistan.http://www.khaama.com/ministry-of-defense-four-out-of-every-ten-militants-are-foreigners-in-afghanistan-3656http://www.silkroadreporters.com/2015/08/03/death-of-mullah-omar-unnerves-central-asia/http://emm.newsexplorer.eu/NewsExplorer/clusteredition/en/20150720,TheFrontierPost-en-c77c9f1eb2e3b3ff541220d957223ca4.htmlhttp://www.en.rahapress.af/forty-percent-of-insurgents-fighting-in-afghanistan-is-foreigners/ These militants cause a surge in fighting in 2015.http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/19280-influx-of-foreign-militants-blamed-for-uptick-in-violence Uyghurs, Chechens, and Uzbeks made up the majority of casualties in clashes against Afghan National Security Forces.

The child soldiers were also shown engaging in religious studies. The village of Az-Zanbaqi (الزنبقي) in Jisr al-Shughur's countryside has become a base for a massive amount of Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party militants and their families in Syria, estimated at around 3,500, military camps in the area are training hundreds of children from these families; Hezbollah media, Iranian media and Syrian government media accused Turkish intelligence of being involved in transporting these Uyghurs via Turkey to Syria, with the aim of using them first in Syria to help Jabhat Al-Nusra and gain combat experience fighting against the Syrian Army before sending them back to Xinjiang to fight against China if they manage to survive.https://twitter.com/MEMRIReports/status/649266299005214720http://www.memri.org/clip/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/5089.htmhttp://www.memritv.org/clip/en/5089.htmhttp://www.memrijttm.org/uyghur-families-colonize-syrian-village.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjYYw4cnVEQ The Syrian political analyst and Arab nationalist Taleb Ibrahim accused Turkey of trying to demographically alter areas of Syria by sending in Turkic peoples like Uyghurs, Turkmens, and others to take over whole villages after ethnically cleansing the Arab locals, accusing Turkey of neo-Ottoman and Turkish colonialist policies towards Syria and trying to take parts of Syria from Arabs.http://therightscoop.com/exposed-the-real-cause-of-the-sudden-syrian-migrant-crisis-into-europe/http://shoebat.com/2015/10/01/turkey-is-sending-hundreds-of-thousands-of-muslim-terrorists-into-europe-in-an-islamic-invasion-while-russia-is-in-syria-fighting-the-islamic-terrorists-and-defending-christians/ The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar wrote an article accusing Turkey of supporting the Turkistan Islamic Party against Syria, with a Turkish-based website recruiting "Uyghur Mujahideen" to come to Turkey and help them enter Syria to fight the Syrian government.http://3arabionline.com/?page=article&id=20680http://3arabionline.com/?page=allarticle&id=120 Küresel Analiz compiled a photo gallery of Turkistan Islamic Party members in Syria.http://kureselanaliz.com/suriyede-en-onde-savasanlar-turkistan-islam-cemaati-mucahidleri-foto-galerihttps://twitter.com/Dogu_Turkistan_/status/658405002499723264   The United States captured 22 Uyghur militants from combat zones in Afghanistan in 2006 on information that they were linked to Al-Qaeda. They were imprisoned without trial for five to seven years, where they testified that they were trained by ETIM leader Abdul Haq, at an ETIM training camp. After being reclassified as No Longer Enemy Combatant, a panel of judges ordered them released into the United States. Despite the alarm of politicians that the release of terrorist camp-trained Uyghurs into the United States was unsafe and illegal, they could not be released back to China because of its human rights record. Some of the Uyghurs have been transferred to Palau, and some to Bermuda despite objections by the United Kingdom, but the United States is having difficulties finding governments who will accept the rest.  In 2007, ETIM militants in cars shot Chinese nationals in Pakistani Balochistan and sent a videotape of the attack to Beijing, in retaliation for an execution of an ETIM official earlier that July. ETIM also took credit for a spate of attacks before the 2008 Summer Olympics, including a series of bus bombings in Kunming, an attempted plane hijacking in Urumqi, and an attack on paramilitary troops in Kashgar that killed 17 officers. On 29 June 2010, a court in Dubai convicted two members of an ETIM cell of plotting to bomb a government-owned shopping mall that sold Chinese goods. This was the ETIM plot outside of China or Central Asia. The key plotter was recruited during Hajj and was flown to Waziristan to train. In July 2010, officials in Norway interrupted a terrorist bomb plot, another instance of ETIM branching out of its original regions and cooperating with international groups. New York Times correspondent Edward Wong says that ETIM "give[s] them a raison d'être at a time when the Chinese government has... defused any chance of a widespread insurgency... in Xinjiang." In October 2013, a suicide attack in Tiananmen Square caused 5 deaths and 38 injuries. Chinese police described it as the first terrorist attack in Beijing's recent history. Turkistan Islamic Party later claimed responsibility for the attack. Responsibility for the April 2014 Ürümqi attack was claimed by the Turkistan Islamic Party. Violent attacks were carried out by Turkey, Afghanistan, and Central Asian based groups. In 2010 responsibility for attacks in China was claimed by the Turkistan Islamic Party.http://neildoyle.com/militants-claim-china-attacks/https://azelin.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/hizbul-islam-turkestani-the-harvest-of-the-military-operation-of-the-east-turkestan-islamic-party-for-the-year-2009.pdfhttp://al-darb.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/harvest-of-military-operation-of-east.html Several attacks in 2011 in Xinjiang were claimed by the Turkistan Islamic Party.http://www.dawn.com/news/657452/turkistan-islamic-party-claims-western-china-attacks In Beijing's Xidan district, a bus bomb killed two people on March 7, 1997 and Uyghur separatists boasted that they were behind the attack. The participation of Uyghurs in the bus bombing was dismissed by the Chinese government even while the Turkey-based "Organisation for East Turkistan Freedom" boasted to committing the attack. Even while the Uyghur jihadist group Turkistan Islamic Party distributes propaganda videos and its own Arabic Islamic Turkistan magazine, which is documented by Jihadology.net and the Jamestown Foundation, the Chinese government seems to try to refuse to acknowledge the existence of the Turkistan Islamic Party, with China even trying to claim that there was no terrorist connection to the 2008 bus bombings in China even while Turkistan Islamic Party boasted on video to committing the attacks. Stratfor has noted repeated unexplained attacks on Chinese buses in 2008 have followed a history of ETIM targeting Chinese infrastructure, and noted the group's splintering and subsequent reorganization following the death of Mahsum. Intelligence analysts J. Todd Reed and Diana Raschke acknowledge that reporting in China presents obstacles not found in countries where information is not so tightly controlled. However, they found that ETIM's existence and activities could be confirmed independently of Chinese government sources, using information gleaned from ETIM's now-defunct website, reports from human rights groups and academics, and testimony from the Uyghur detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Reed & Raschke also question the information put out by Uyghur expatriates that deny ETIM's existence or impact, as the Uyghurs who leave Xinjiang are those who object most to government policy, are unable to provide first-hand analysis, and have an incentive to exaggerate repression and downplay militancy. They say that ETIM was "obscure but not unknown" before the September 11 attacks, citing "Western, Russian, and Chinese media sources" that have "documented the ETIM's existence for nearly 20 years". Nick Holdstock, in a New York Times interview claimed that no organization is taking responsibility for attacks in Xinjiang, and that there is not enough proof to blame any organization for the attacks, that most "terrorism" there is "unsubstantiated", and that posting internet videos online is the only thing done by the "vague and shadowy" ETIM.https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/q-and-a-nick-holdstock-on-xinjiang-and-chinas-forgotten-people The Turkistan Islamic Party's magazine "Turkistān al-Islāmīyyah" Issue #14 endorsed attacks and killings against Chinese workers and referred to "Martyrdom Operations" against a police station and a "Martyr's Brigade".تركستان الإسلامية ، العدد الرابع عشر ، ربيع الأول 1435 صفحة 23 TIP's "Islamic Turkistan" magazine Issue #14 praised the Taliban and "mujahideen" for what it called the "humiliating" of America in Afghanistan and boasted that American suffered over 17 billion dollars of damage of "physical and military losses" and "ten thousand soldiers" dead at the hands of Arab and non-Arab "mujahideen".https://siddiqlar1.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/%d8%aa%d8%b1%d9%83%d8%b3%d8%aa%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a5%d8%b3%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%a6%d9%89%d8%b3%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%85%d9%89-%d8%aa%db%88%d8%b1%d9%83%d9%89%d8%b3%d8%aa%d8%a7%d9%86-2/http://siddiqlarbiz.blogspot.com/2014/02/blog-post_65.htmlتركستان الإسلامية ، العدد الرابع عشر ، ربيع الأول 1435 صفحة 3 هزيمة الأمريكان في أفغانستان أرّقت حكام الصينhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140701212027/http://jihadology.net/2014/03/29/%E1%B9%A3awt-al-islam-presents-issue-14-of-%E1%B8%A5izb-al-islami-al-turkistanis-turkistan-islamic-party-magazine-turkistan-al-islamiyyah/ The TIP has some members of other ethnicities besides the Uighur, a TIP suicide bomber in Afghanistan who attacked American troops was Nuruddin, a Turkish  militant and he advocated that Turks and Uighurs mount "Islamic flags at the White House and Beijing's Tiananmen Square" while a TIP Kazakh member named Uspan Batir made an appearance in a video and said There is a line artificially drawn by the infidel in between us--saying you are from Kazakhstan, Turkistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan--there is a line drawn artificially by the infidel, my brothers . . .

Slaughtering you... And cutting off your heads is all good", "Kill you, spill your blood, cut off your head is a good thing", the unedited message said "We are Muslims, and you are our enemies oh Buddhists and Chinese: You will not see us and killing you, and spilling your blood, and cutting your heads of: all of it is good, insha Allah" (نحن مسلمون، ولو كنتم أعداءنا أيُّها البوذيون والصينيون: لن تروا منا إلا خيرًا، وقتلكم وإسالة دمائكم، وقطع رؤوسكم: كله خير إن شاء الله.ـ) on 24 February 2014, he also said "we are a nation that loves death while you are a nation that loves wine and women, and we are coming insha Allah, we want to kill Buddhists to the east of this land and to the west of it". (إننا قوم نحب الموت كما تحبون الخمر والنساء، وإننا قادمون إن شاء الله، نحن نريد أن نقتل البوذيين في شرق الأرض وغربها.ـ), he also said "those Chinese Buddhists, their small eyes, flat noses.

During the [ensuing] search [by the authorities for the perpetrators], the elder brother died as a martyr in the field of glory and honor, Allah willing. The younger brother, Dzokhar, remained, and told his dear nation: 'We did this operation as revenge for what America does in Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan.' He didn't mention his homeland Chechnya, since this jihad is a jihad of [an entire] nation, not [a campaign] for the liberation of a single land.... The Muslims' lands are one and their honor is one. Abu Dhar Azzam called upon Muslims to attack Germany, China, and Burma, saying : Rise O servants of Allah to help your brothers and sisters!, Rise to save your sons and daughters! Do your best in jihad, O guardians of creed and [monotheism], against the enemies of Allah the idolatrous Buddhists, and target the most important installations of Burma, China and Germany, and their interests and the interests of the United Nations, which supports these massacres and this genocide in Arakan. Abu Dhar ‘Azzam featured in a video released by TIP titled "We Have To Empower Islam In the Depths Of Our Hearts".http://videos.videopress.com/weYW9QrY/abc5ab-dhar-e28098azzc481m-22we-have-to-empower-islam-in-the-depths-of-our-hearts22_std.mp4 Countries and organizations below have officially listed the Turkestan Islamic Movement as a terrorist group.
