    Kirk Douglas (born Issur Danielovitch; December 9, 1916) is an American retired actor, producer, director, and author. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During a sixty-year acting career, he has appeared in over 90 movies, and in 1960 was responsible for helping to end the Hollywood blacklist. In 1949, after a lead role as an unscrupulous boxing hero in Champion, for which he was nominated as Best Actor, Douglas became a star. His style of acting relied on expressing great concentration, realism, and powerful emotions, and he subsequently gravitated toward roles requiring strong characters. Among his early films were Young Man with a Horn, playing opposite Lauren Bacall (1950), Billy Wilder's controversial Ace in the Hole (1951), and Detective Story (1951). He received a second Oscar nomination for his dramatic role in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), where he played opposite Lana Turner. His powerful acting performance as Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956) is considered one of his finest roles. He and Olivia de Havilland are among the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood. In 1955, he established Bryna Productions, which began producing films as varied as Paths of Glory (1957) and Spartacus (1960). In those two films, he starred and collaborated with then relatively unknown director, Stanley Kubrick. Douglas helped break the Hollywood blacklist with the latter by having Dalton Trumbo openly write it with an official on-screen credit, although Trumbo's family claims he overstated his role. He produced and starred in Lonely Are the Brave (1962), considered a cult classic, and Seven Days in May (1964), opposite Burt Lancaster, with whom he made seven films. In 1963, he starred in the Broadway play One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a story he purchased, which he later gave to his son Michael Douglas, who turned it into an Oscar-winning film. As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas has received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Medal of Freedom. As an author, he has written ten novels and memoirs. Currently, he is No. 17 on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he has focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lives with producer Anne Buydens, his wife of over 60 years. Douglas was born Issur Danielovitch in Amsterdam, New York, the son of Bryna "Bertha" (née Sanglel) and Herschel "Harry" Danielovitch (1884-1950, as confirmed by Kirk Douglas in his autobiography The Ragman's Son), a businessman.[ ] Kirk Douglas Biography (1916–) His parents were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mogilev Region, in the Russian Empire (now Belarus), and the family spoke Yiddish at home. His father's brother, who emigrated earlier, used the surname Demsky, which Douglas' family adopted in the United States.Douglas, Kirk. Let's Face It. John Wiley & Sons, 2007. ISBN 0-470-08469-3. Douglas grew up as Izzy Demsky and legally changed his name to Kirk Douglas before entering the United States Navy during World War II. In his 1988 autobiography, The Ragman's Son, Douglas notes the hardships that he, along with six sisters and his parents, endured during their early years in New York:  Growing up, Douglas sold snacks to mill workers to earn enough to buy milk and bread to help his family. Later, he delivered newspapers and during his youth worked at more than forty different jobs before getting a job acting.Thomas, p. 12 He found living in a family with six sisters to be stifling: "I was dying to get out. In a sense, it lit a fire under me."Thomas, p. 13 In high school, after acting in plays, he then knew he wanted to become a professional actor. Unable to afford tuition, Douglas talked his way into the Dean's office at the St. Lawrence University and showed him a list of his high school honors. He received a loan which he paid back by working part-time as a gardener and a janitor. He was a standout on the wrestling team, and wrestled one summer in a carnival to make money.Thomas, p. 15 Douglas' acting talents were noticed at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City and he received a special scholarship. One of his classmates was Betty Joan Perske (later to become better known as Lauren Bacall), who would play an important role in launching his film career.Thomas, p. 18  Another classmate, and a friend of Bacall, was aspiring actress, Diana Dill, who would later become Douglas's wife. Bacall writes that she "had a wild crush on Kirk,"Bacall, Lauren. By Myself and Then Some, HarperCollins (1978) p. 26 and they dated casually. During their time together, she learned that he had no money, and he once spent the night in jail as he had no place to sleep. She gave him her uncle's old coat to keep warm: "I thought he must be frozen in the winter.... He was thrilled and grateful." During that period she fantasized about some day sharing her personal and stage life with Douglas, but would later be disappointed: "Kirk did not really pursue me. He was friendly and sweet–enjoyed my company–but I was clearly too young for him," she later wrote. Douglas first wanted to be an actor after he recited the poem The Red Robin of Spring while in kindergarten and received applause. He enlisted in the United States Navy in 1941, shortly after the United States entered World War II, and was medically discharged for war injuries in 1944. He married Diana Dill on November 2, 1943. They had two sons, Michael in 1944 and Joel in 1947, before they divorced in 1951.Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 17. After the war, Douglas returned to New York City and found work in radio, theater and commercials. In his radio work, he acted in a number of network soap operas, and sees those experiences as being especially valuable, as skill in using one's voice is important for aspiring actors, and regrets that the same avenues are no longer open to them. His stage break occurred in Kiss and Tell, which led to other roles. Douglas had planned to remain a stage actor, until his friend, Lauren Bacall, helped him get his first film role by recommending him to director Hal Wallis, who was looking for a new male talent.Parker, John. Michael Douglas: Acting on Instinct, e-book (2011), Ch. 2 Wallis's film, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946), with Barbara Stanwyck, became Douglas's debut screen appearance. He played a young, insecure man, stung with jealousy, whose life was dominated by a ruthless older woman, and he hid his feelings with alcohol. It would be the last time that Douglas portrayed a weakling in a film role.Smith, Imogen Sara. In Lonely Places: Film Noir Beyond the City, McFarland (2011) p. 103Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 33. Reviewers of the film noted that Douglas already projected qualities of a "natural film actor," with the similarity of this role with later ones explained by biographer Tony Thomas: At the time the film came out, adds Thomas, movie heroes were beginning to change from those portrayed before the war. Audiences now looked for a "harder, more realistic working-man hero." And Douglas, projecting a forceful and combative persona, exemplified the new "antihero." He understood that portraying hard-nosed "sons-of-bitches" was an important aspect of a screen personality, and explained its value: "I've always tried to show how a man got that way. The guy might not be any good but you must understand him. Often, in my films, he's a rebel against society." Director George Stevens would later agree, when during his 1991 AFI tribute to Douglas, he stated, "His special gift had been to show us the flaws in every hero and the virtues in every heel." Douglas's image as a tough guy was established in his eighth film, Champion (1949), after producer Stanley Kramer chose him to play a selfish boxer. In accepting the role, he took a gamble, however, since he had to turn down an offer to star in a big-budget MGM film, The Great Sinner, which would have earned him three times the income. Film historian, Ray Didinger says "he saw Champion as a greater risk, but also a greater opportunity. . . Douglas took the part and absolutely nailed it." Frederick Romano, another sports film historian, described Douglas's acting as "alarmingly authentic":   Douglas received his first Academy Award nomination and the film earned six nominations in all.  Variety magazine called it "a stark, realistic study of the boxing rackets."Didinger, Ray, and Macnow, Glen. The Ultimate Book of Sports Movies: Featuring the 100 Greatest Sports Films, Running Press (2009) p. 260 Douglas's gamble paid off,  his portrayal of the ruthless boxer making him a major star. His dynamic and realistic character portrayal in the film, combined with his strong acting style, set the course for his future film career, allowing him to avoid working under the studio system and henceforth to choose his own films. From that film on, he decided that to succeed as a star, he needed to ramp up his intensity, overcome his natural shyness, and choose stronger roles. He later stated, "I don't think I'd be much of an actor without vanity. And I'm not interested in being a 'modest actor'."Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 28. Early in his Hollywood career, he demonstrated his independent streak and broke his studio contracts to gain total control over his projects, forming his own movie company, Bryna Productions, named after his mother.Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 13 In 1947 Douglas made Out of the Past (UK:  Build My Gallows High). He starred in this film with Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer. Douglas made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the Anton Chekhov play Three Sisters, produced by Katharine Cornell.Mosel, Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Douglas was a major box-office star, playing opposite some of the leading actresses of that era. He played a frontier peace officer in his first western Along the Great Divide (1951). He quickly became comfortable with riding horses and playing gunslingers, and appeared in many westerns. Douglas considers Lonely Are the Brave (1962), in which he plays a cowboy trying to live by his own code, as his favorite of his own performances.Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 181. The film, while respected by critics, did not do well at the box office, which Douglas attributes to poor marketing and distribution.Thomas, p. 28 In 1951, Douglas starred as a newspaper reporter anxiously looking for a big story in Ace in the Hole, director Billy Wilder's first effort as both writer and producer. The subject and story was controversial at the time, and U.S. audiences stayed away. Some reviews saw it as "ruthless and cynical...a distorted study of corruption, mob psychology and the free press."Sikov, Ed.

Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder, a Personal Biography, Applause Books (2002) p. 166 As the film's star and protagonist, Douglas is credited for the intensity of his acting. Roger Ebert described "Douglas's focus and energy ... as almost scary. There is nothing dated about [his] performance. It's as right now as a sharpened knife." Biographer Gene Philips notes that Wilder's story was "galvanized" by Douglas's "astounding performance," and no doubt was a factor when George Stevens, who presented Douglas with the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1991, said of him: "No other leading actor was ever more ready to tap the dark, desperate side of the soul and thus to reveal the complexity of human nature."Phillips, Gene. Some Like it Wilder: the Life and Controversial films of Billy Wilder, Univ. Press of Kentucky (2010) p. 141 In 1951, Douglas starred in Detective Story, nominated for four Academy Awards, including one for Lee Grant in her debut film. Grant said Douglas was "dazzling, both personally and in the part. . . . He was a big, big star. Gorgeous. Intense. Amazing."Grant, Lee. I Said Yes to Everything: a Memoir, Blue Rider Press (2014) pp. 75, 428-429. ISBN 978-0-399-16930-4 Reviewers recognized Douglas's acting qualities, with Bosley Crowther describing Douglas as "forceful and aggressive as the detective." Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, November 7, 1951. Last accessed: December 26, 2007.  In The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), another of his three Oscar-nominated roles, Douglas plays a hard-nosed film producer who manipulates and uses his actors, writers, and directors.Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 93 "It's difficult to make a movie about making movies, and to make it believable," Douglas says. The film won five Academy Awards out of six nominations. In Young Man with a Horn (1950), Douglas portrays the rise and fall of a driven jazz musician, based on real-life horn player Bix Beiderbecke.  Composer-pianist Hoagy Carmichael, playing the sidekick role, added realism to the film and gave Douglas insight into the role, being a friend of the real Beiderbecke.Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 64. In one of his earliest television appearances, Douglas was a musical guest (as himself) on The Jack Benny Program (1954)."Jam Session at Jacks'", originally telecast on CBS, October 17, 1954. In 1955, Douglas demonstrated his independent streak and formed his own movie company, Bryna Productions, named after his mother. To do so, he had to break contracts with Hal Wallis and Warner Brothers, but then began producing his own films, as varied as Paths of Glory (1957), Spartacus (1960), Lonely are the Brave (1962) and Seven Days in May (1964), all of which he starred in. While Paths of Glory did not do well at the box office, it has since become one of the great anti-war films, and one of early films by director Stanley Kubrick. Douglas plays a sympathetic French officer during World War I who tries to save three soldiers from the firing squad.Monush, Barry. The Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors, Applause Books, (2003) p. 200 Biographer Vincent LoBrutto describes Douglas's "seething but controlled portrayal exploding with the passion of his convictions at the injustice leveled at his men."LoBrutto, Vincent. Stanley Kubrick: A Biography, Da Capo Press (1997) pp. 105, 135 The film was banned in France until 1976. Before production of the film began, however, Douglas and Kubrick had to work out some major issues, one of which was Kubrick's rewriting the screenplay without informing Douglas first. It led to their first major argument: "I called Stanley to my room... I hit the ceiling. I called him every four-letter word I could think of... 'I got the money, based on that [original] script. Not this shit!' I threw the script across the room. 'We're going back to the original script, or we're not making the picture.' Stanley never blinked an eye. We shot the original script. I think the movie is a classic, one of the most important pictures--possibly the most important picture--Stanley Kubrick has ever made." Douglas played military men in numerous films, with varying nuance, including Top Secret Affair (1957), Town Without Pity (1961), The Hook (1963), Seven Days in May (1964), Heroes of Telemark (1965), In Harm's Way (1965), Cast a Giant Shadow (1966), Is Paris Burning (1966), The Final Countdown (1980) and Saturn 3 (1980). His distinctive acting style and delivery made him a favorite with television impersonators such as Frank Gorshin, Rich Little and David Frye.Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas.

Douglas was noted not only for the veracity of van Gogh's appearance but for how he conveyed the painter's internal turmoil. Some reviewers consider it the most famous example of the "tortured artist" who seeks solace from life's pain through his work.Fairbanks, Brian. Brian W. Fairbanks - Writings, Lulu (2005) e-book Others see it as a portrayal not only of the "painter-as-hero," but a unique presentation of the "action painter," with Douglas expressing the physicality and emotion of painting, as he uses the canvas to capture a moment in time.McElhaney. Vincente Minnelli: The Art of Entertainment, Wayne State Univ. Press (2009) p. 300Niemi, Robert. History in the Media: Film and Television, ABC-CLIO (2006) p. 296 He was nominated for an Academy Award for the role, with his costar Anthony Quinn winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Paul Gauguin, van Gogh's friend. Douglas won a Golden Globe award, although Minnelli said Douglas should have won an Oscar: "He achieved a moving and memorable portrait of the artist—a man of massive creative power, triggered by severe emotional stress, the fear and horror of madness."Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 7. Douglas himself called his acting role as Van Gogh a painful experience:  "Not only did I look like Van Gogh, I was the same age he was when he committed suicide." His wife said he often remained in character in his personal life: "When he was doing Lust for Life, he came home in that red beard of Van Gogh's, wearing those big boots, stomping around the house—it was frightening." In general, however, Douglas's acting style fit well with Minnelli's preference for "melodrama and neurotic-artist roles," writes film historian, James Naremore. He adds that Minnelli had his "richest, most impressive collaborations" with Douglas, and for Minnelli, no other actor portrayed his level of "cool": "A robust, athletic, sometimes explosive player, Douglas loved stagy rhetoric, and he did everything passionately."Naremore, James. The Films of Vincente Minnelli, Cambridge Univ. Press (1993) p. 41 That level of passion in Douglas's persona was also used effectively by Minnelli in The Bad and the Beautiful, four years earlier, in which Douglas was nominated for Best Actor, with the film winning five Oscars.  Douglas played the lead with an all-star cast in Spartacus (1960). He was the executive producer as well, raising the $12&nbsp;million production cost, making it one of the most expensive films made up to that time.Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 168. Douglas initially selected Anthony Mann to direct, but replaced him early on with  Stanley Kubrick, with whom he previously collaborated in Paths of Glory.Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 149. When the film was released, Douglas gave full credit to its screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo, who was on the Hollywood blacklist, and thereby effectively ended it. About that event, he said, "I've made over 85 pictures, but the thing I'm most proud of is breaking the blacklist."Paskin, Barbra. "Hollywood gladiator Kirk Douglas has his eyes set on a third barmitzvah", The Jewish Chronicle, September 20, 2012 At the time, his career was at risk, with Hollywood people claiming Douglas would never get work again. "I was scared to death, but I insisted on doing it," he said. George Clooney has said that "in the history books, it's marked as the moment that the Hollywood blacklist ended."Douglas, Kirk. I Am Spartacus! Making a Film, Breaking the Blacklist, Open Road (2012) p. 2 In the film Trumbo (2015), Douglas is portrayed by Dean O'Gorman."'Trumbo's' Dean O'Gorman plays Kirk Douglas and earns praise from the legend", Los Angeles Times, Oct. 30, 2015 In 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), Douglas showed that in addition to serious, driven characters, he was adept at roles requiring a lighter, comic touch. In this adaptation of the Jules Verne novel, he played a happy-go-lucky sailor who was the opposite in every way to the brooding Captain Nemo (James Mason). The film was one of Walt Disney's most successful live-action movies and a major box-office hit. He managed a similar comic turn in the western Man Without a Star (1955) and in For Love or Money (1963).  Douglas bought the rights to the novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest from its author, Ken Kesey. He turned it into a play in 1963 in which he starred, and it ran on Broadway for five months. Reviews were mixed. Douglas retained the movie rights, but after a decade of being unable to find a producer, gave the rights to his son, Michael. In 1975, the film version was produced by Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz, and starred Jack Nicholson, as Douglas was then considered too old to play the character as written. It won five Academy Awards, including one for Nicholson.Douglas, Edward. Jack: A Biography of Jack Nicholson, HarperCollins (2004) p. 136 Douglas made seven films over the decades with Burt Lancaster: I Walk Alone (1948), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), The Devil's Disciple (1959), The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), Seven Days in May (1964), Victory at Entebbe (1976) and Tough Guys (1986), which fixed the notion of the pair as something of a team in the public imagination. Douglas was always second-billed under Lancaster in these movies but, with the exception of I Walk Alone, in which Douglas played a villain, their roles were more or less the same size. Both actors arrived in Hollywood at the same time, and first appeared together in the fourth film for each, albeit with Douglas in a supporting role. They both became actor-producers who sought out independent Hollywood careers.Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 44. John Frankenheimer, who directed the political thriller Seven Days in May in 1964, had not worked well with Lancaster in the past, and originally did not want him in this film. However Douglas thought Lancaster would fit the part and "begged me to reconsider," said Frankenheimer, and he then gave Lancaster the most colorful role. "It turns out that Burt Lancaster and I got along magnificently well on the picture," he later said.Armstrong, Stephen B. ed., John Frankenheimer: Interviews, Essays, and Profiles, Rowman & Littlefield (2013) p. 166 In The Arrangement (1969), a drama directed by Elia Kazan, based upon his novel of the same title, Douglas starred as a tormented advertising executive,  with Faye Dunaway as costar. The film did poorly at the box office, receiving mostly negative reviews, while Dunaway  felt many of the reviews were unfair, writing in her biography, "I can't understand it when people knock Kirk's performance, because I think he's terrific in the picture," adding that "he's as bright a person as I've met in the acting profession."Hunter, Allan. Faye Dunaway, St. Martin's Press, N.Y. (1986) p. 81 She says that his "pragmatic approach to acting" would later be a "philosophy that ended up rubbing off on me."Dunaway, Faye. Looking for Gatsby, Simon & Schuster (1995) p. 193 Between 1970 and 2008, Douglas made nearly 40 movies and appeared on various television shows. In 1970, he starred in a western, There Was a Crooked Man..., alongside Henry Fonda. The film was produced and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. In 1973, he directed his first film, Scalawag. Also in 1973, Douglas appeared in a made-for-TV musical version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1973)." New York Times Review. Retrieved October 1, 2008. In 1978, he costarred with John Cassavetes and Amy Irving in a horror film, The Fury, directed by Brian De Palma. In 1980, he starred in The Final Countdown, playing the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, which travels through time to the day before the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. It was produced by his son Peter Douglas. In 1982, he starred in The Man from Snowy River, an Australian film which received critical acclaim and numerous awards. In 1986, he reunited with his longtime costar, Burt Lancaster, in a crime comedy, Tough Guys, which included Charles Durning and Eli Wallach. In 1986, he co-hosted (with Angela Lansbury) the New York Philharmonic's tribute to the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. The symphony was conducted by Zubin Mehta. In 1988, Douglas starred in a television adaptation of Inherit the Wind, opposite Jason Robards and Jean Simmons. The film won two Emmy Awards. In the 1990s, Douglas continued starring in various features. Among them was The Secret in 1992, a television movie about a  grandfather and his grandson who both struggle with dyslexia. That same year, he played the uncle of Michael J. Fox in a comedy, Greedy. In 1996, after suffering a severe stroke which impaired his ability to speak, Douglas still wanted to make movies. He underwent years of voice therapy and made Diamonds in 1999, in which he played an old prizefighter who was recovering from a stroke. It costarred his longtime friend from his early years, Lauren Bacall. In 2003, his sons Michael Douglas and Joel Douglas produced It Runs in the Family, which along with Kirk starred various family members, including Michael, Michael's son, and his wife from 50 years earlier, Diana Dill, playing his wife. In March 2009, Douglas did an autobiographical one-man show titled Before I Forget at the Center Theatre Group's Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, California. The four performances were filmed and turned into a documentary that was first screened in January 2010. Douglas stated that the keys to acting success are determination and application: "You must know how to function and how to maintain yourself, and you must have a love of what you do. But an actor also needs great good luck. I have had that luck."Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 11. Douglas had great vitality and explained that "it takes a lot out of you to work in this business. Many people fall by the wayside because they don't have the energy to sustain their talent."Thomas, Tony. The Films of Kirk Douglas. Citadel Press, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-8065-1217-2. p. 21 That attitude toward acting became evident with Champion (1949). From that one role, writes biographer John Parker, he went from stardom and entered the "superleague," where his style was in "marked contrast to Hollywood's other leading men at the time." His sudden rise to prominence is explained and compared to that of Jack Nicholson's: As a producer, Douglas had a reputation of being a compulsively hard worker who expected others to exude the same level of energy. As such, he was typically demanding and direct in his dealing with people who worked on his projects, with his intensity spilling over into all elements of his film-making. This was partly due to his high opinion of actors, movies, and moviemaking: "To me it is the most important art form—it is an art, and it includes all the elements of the modern age." He also stressed prioritizing the entertainment goal of films over any messages, "You can make a statement, you can say something, but it must be entertaining." As an actor, he dived into every role, dissecting not only his own lines but all the parts in the script to measure the rightness of the role, and he was willing to fight with a director if he felt justified.Thomas, p. 21. Melville Shavelson, who produced and directed Cast a Giant Shadow (1966), said that it didn't take him long to discover what his main problem was going to be in directing Douglas:   For most of his career, Douglas enjoyed good health and what seemed like an inexhaustible supply of energy. Much of that vitality he attributes to his childhood and pre-acting years: "The drive that got me out of my hometown and through college is part of the makeup that I utilize in my work. It's a constant fight, and it's tough." His demands on others, however, were an expression of the demands he placed on himself, rooted in his youth. "It took me years to concentrate on being a human being - I was too busy scrounging for money and food, and struggling to better myself."Thomas, p. 25 Actress Lee Grant, who acted with him and later filmed a documentary about him and his family, notes that even after he achieved worldwide stardom, his father would not acknowledge his success. He said "nothing. Ever." Douglas's wife, Anne, similarly attributes his tough childhood to the energy he devotes to acting: He credits his mother, Bryna, for instilling in him the importance of "gambling on yourself," and he kept her advice in mind when making films. Bryna Productions was named in her honor. Douglas realized that his intense style of acting was something of a shield: "Acting is the most direct way of escaping reality, and in my case it was a means of escaping a drab and dismal background."Thomas, p. 22 Douglas married twice, first to Diana Dill, on November 2, 1943. They divorced in 1951. The couple had two sons, actor Michael Douglas and producer Joel Douglas.  Afterwards, he met German American producer Anne Buydens in Paris while acting on location in Lust for Life.She uses the name "Barbara Douglas" on the March 27, 1966 "What's My Line" show. "Hollywood Legend Kirk Douglas, His Wife Delve Into Their 60-Year Love Affair", CBS Los Angeles, July 25, 2014 She originally fled from Germany to escape Nazism and survived by putting her multilingual skills to work at a film studio, doing translations for subtitles. They married on May 29, 1954, and in 2014 they celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary at the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. They had two sons, producer Peter Douglas and actor Eric Douglas. Eric Douglas died on July 6, 2004, of a drug overdose. In February 1991, Douglas was injured in a collision between the helicopter he was in and a small plane above Santa Paula Airport. Two others were also injured, and two people on the plane died. This near-death experience sparked a search for meaning by Douglas, which led him, after much study, to embrace the Judaism in which he had been raised. He documented this spiritual journey in his book Climbing the Mountain: My Search for Meaning (2001). In his earlier autobiography, The Ragman's Son (1988), he recalled, "years back, I tried to forget that I was a Jew," but later in his career he began "coming to grips with what it means to be a Jew," which became a theme in his life.Douglas, Kirk. The Ragman's Son, Simon and Schuster (1988) pp. 383-384 ISBN 9780671637170. In an interview in 2000, he explained this transition:Douglas, Kirk Climbing the Mountain: Essay and Interview with Kirk Douglas. aish.com, 2000. Retrieved August 16, 2015  Douglas notes that the underlying theme of some of his films, including The Juggler (1953), Cast a Giant Shadow (1966), and Remembrance of Love (1982), was about "a Jew who doesn't think of himself as one, and eventually finds his Jewishness." The Juggler was the first Hollywood feature to be filmed in the newly established state of Israel. Douglas recalls that while there, he saw "extreme poverty and food being rationed." But he found it "wonderful, finally, to be in the majority." Its producer, Stanley Kramer, tried to portray "Israel as the Jews' heroic response to Hitler's destruction."Moore, Deborah. To the Golden Cities: Pursuing the American Jewish Dream in Miami and L.A., Harvard Univ. Press (1994) p. 245 Although his children had a non-Jewish mother, Douglas states that they were "aware culturally" of his "deep convictions," and he never tried to influence their own religious decisions. Douglas' wife, Anne, converted to Judaism before they renewed their wedding vows in 2004. Douglas celebrated a second Bar-Mitzvah ceremony in 1999 at the age of eighty-three.

Douglas has been a lifelong supporter of the Democratic Party. He has on occasion written letters to politicians who were friends. He notes in his memoir, Let's Face It (2007), that he felt compelled to write to former president Jimmy Carter in 2006 in order to stress that "Israel is the only successful democracy in the Middle East... [and] has had to endure many wars against overwhelming odds. If Israel loses one war, they lose Israel." On January 28, 1996, he suffered a severe stroke, impairing his ability to speak. Doctors told his wife that unless there was rapid improvement, the loss of the ability to speak was likely permanent. After a regime of daily voice therapy that lasted several months, his ability to speak returned, although it was still limited. He was able to accept an honorary Academy Award two months later in March and thank the audience. Douglas wrote about this experience in a book, My Stroke of Luck, which he hoped would be an "operating manual" for others on how to handle a stroke victim in their own family.

Both his son, Michael, and his long-time friend, Jack Valenti, urged him to only say "Thank you," and leave the stage. Douglas agreed. But when standing in front of the audience, he had second thoughts: "I intended to just say 'thank you,' but I saw 1,000 people, and felt I had to say something more, and I did."
