 Kenosha  is a city in and the county seat of Kenosha County, Wisconsin, United States. Kenosha lies on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan. With an estimated population of 99,889 as of July 1, 2013, it is the fourth-largest city in Wisconsin and the fourth-largest city on Lake Michigan. The city is part of the United States Census Bureau's Chicago Combined Statistical Area (CSA). Early archaeological sites have been discovered in the Kenosha vicinity; the discoverer of two sites believes that they pre-date the Clovis culture, making them contemporaneous with the ice age.Wasion, David.  "The Mammoth Hunter: David Wasion's Quest for Pre-Clovis People in North America" The Citizen Scientist, 11 February 2005.  Accessed 8 April 2005. Paleo Indians first settled in the area at least 13,500 years ago.Falk, Terrence.  "Bones to Pick" Milwaukee Magazine, April 2004 The Potawatomi originally named the area gnozhé ("place of the pike"). The early name by the Ojibwa Indians is reported as Masu-kinoja. This describes the place of spawning trout as "trout (pike) come all at same time".  There were thousands of fish entering the rivers from Lake Michigan. Harvesting these fish provided food for the coming months. The first white settlers were part of the Western Emigration Company. They arrived in the early 1830s from Hannibal and Troy, New York, led by John Bullen, Jr., who sought to purchase enough land for a town.  Thwarted in Milwaukee and Racine, the group arrived at Pike Creek on 6 June 1835, building log homes at first and, later, homes of frame, native stone and brick.  The first school and churches followed by 1835, with platting completed in 1836.  As more settlers arrived and the first post office was established, the community was first known as Pike Creek in 1836.  In the ensuing years the area became an important Great Lakes shipping port, and in 1837 the village was renamedSouthport. (This is still the name of a southeast-side neighborhood, park, and elementary school, as well as several businesses). In 1850, another change brought the growing city (and later Kenosha County) its current title, an Anglicized version of the early name Kinoje. Kenoshans often refer affectionately to their city as "K-Town" and "Keno" (the latter adopted by some local businesses). Between 1902 and 1988, Kenosha produced millions of automobiles and trucksCity’s auto history reaches back more than 100 years  under marques such as Jeffery, Rambler, Nash, Hudson, LaFayette, and American Motors Corporation (AMC). A prototype steam car was built in Kenosha by the Sullivan-Becker engineering firm in 1900. Two years later the Thomas B. Jeffery Company, builders of the Sterling bicycle, began production of the Rambler runabout. In 1902 Rambler and Oldsmobile were the first cars to employ mass-production techniques. The 1902 Rambler was also the first automobile to incorporate a steering wheel, rather than use the then-common tiller-controlled steering. In 1916 Jeffery was purchased by auto executive Charles W. Nash and became Nash Motors. In May 1954, Nash acquired Detroit-based Hudson and the new firm was named American Motors Corporation. A  west side park and an elementary school are named for Charles W. Nash. In partnership with French automaker Renault, AMC manufactured several models in Kenosha in the early 1980s including the Alliance, which won the 1983 “Car of The Year” award from Motor Trend magazine. Two decades earlier, AMC's 1963 Rambler Classic had also received the award.  In 1987 Renault sold its controlling interest in AMC to Chrysler Corporation, which had already contracted with AMC for the production of its M-body mid-sized cars at the Kenosha plant. The AMC Lakefront plant (1960–88), a smaller facility, was demolished in 1990 (a chimney-demolition ceremony that June drew 10,000 spectators) and was redeveloped into upscale HarborPark, with its rambling lakeside condominiums, large recreational marina, water park and promenades, artworks, sculptures, fountains (including the 2007 Christopher Columbus fountain), the Kenosha Public Museum, which opened in 2000, and the Civil War Museum, which opened in 2008, all connected by the Kenosha Electric Railway streetcar system. From the start of the 20th century through the 1930s, Italian, Irish, Polish and German immigrants, many of them skilled craftsmen, made their way to the city and contributed to the city's construction, culture, architecture, music and literature. Kenosha has 21 locations and three districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places including the Library Park, Third Avenue, and the Civic Center historic districts. The city has a Kenosha Landmarks Commission, and among the many local city-designated landmarks are the 1929 YMCA at 711 59th Place, the Manor House at 6536 Third Avenue, the John McCaffary House at 5732 13th Court, the St. Matthew Episcopal Church at 5900 Seventh Avenue, the Washington Park Clubhouse at 2205 Washington Road, and the Justin Weed House at 3509 Washington Road. In June 1993, the city installed reproductions of the historic Sheridan LeGrande street lights that were specially designed for Kenosha by Westinghouse Electric in 1928; these can be seen on Sixth Avenue between 54th Street and 59th Place. A classic two-mile (3&nbsp;km) downtown electric streetcar system was opened on June 17, 2000, and on September 22nd, 2014 the Kenosha city council approved a crosstown extension of the system incorporating the existing route between 48th and 61st Streets on both Sixth and Eighth Avenues.Kenosha News, September 23, 2014 Kenosha is located in southeastern Wisconsin at  (42.582220, -87.845624). It is bordered by Lake Michigan to the east, the Town of Somers to the north, the village of Bristol to the west, and the village of Pleasant Prairie to the south. Kenosha's passenger train station is the last stop on Chicago's Union Pacific North Metra Line and is located almost halfway between Milwaukee and Chicago.

Passenger service began on May 28, 1866, and it continues to the present day. Kenosha has the only Metra station in Wisconsin, with nine inbound and nine outbound trains each weekday.

Kenosha is one of the smallest cities in America with any type of streetcar system today.Diners, drive-in theater, streetcars and a tiki bar: Wisconsin city offers charm aplenty just 50 miles from Chicago  In 2013, the city council authorized expansion of streetcar service in order to connect the city's downtown with other lakeshore areas and public attractions and landmarks. In addition to a streetcar line, Kenosha has a city bus network that includes eight routes. Kenosha was the first city to color-code transit routes (with the Blue, Green, Red, and Orange Lines), and also the first city to use electric trolley buses in full transit service, both occurring on February 14, 1932.Canfield, Joseph M. TM: The Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Company, CERA Bulletin 112. Chicago: Central Electric Railfans' Assoc., 1972 Kenosha is served by two intercity bus systems. Wisconsin Coach Lines buses stop in front of the city's Metra station, connecting riders to Racine, Milwaukee, and the O'Hare International Airport in western Chicago, and difficult to get to by train. The Western Kenosha County Transit Route 1 stops at Southport Plaza, connecting riders to smaller area towns such as Twin Lakes, Paddock Lake, Bristol, and Salem. By highway, Kenosha is served mainly by Interstate 94 which connects Chicago with Milwaukee, and thence west to the state capitol, Madison, Wisconsin. By passenger train, Kenosha is also served by Amtrak's Hiawatha Line service (from the Sturtevant station in Racine County to the north, just  from downtown), with trains between Chicago and Milwaukee seven times daily. The Hiawatha serves commuters from Kenosha who work in either one of these two large cities. In Kenosha County, numbered streets run east-west and numbered avenues north-south, with street numbering commencing with First Street on Kenosha County's northern border (County Trunk Highway KR) rather than at the city's center. ("Roads" are diagonal thoroughfares, "Courts" are short north-south avenues, and "Places" are short east-west streets.) The downtown area of Kenosha is located between 50th and 60th Streets. Avenue numbers increase as one heads west from the lakefront. This numbering system continues through all of Kenosha County, ending at 408th Avenue to the west at the Kenosha-Walworth County line, while north-south roads end at the Illinois state line at 128th Street.

The museum also displays other ice age and fine art exhibits. The Kenosha History Center is in the 1917 city water treatment plant on Simmons Island adjoining the 1866 Kenosha Light Station.
