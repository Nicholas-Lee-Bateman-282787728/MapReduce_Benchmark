SLAVERY: The Tinton Iron Works, started in 1674, was nicknamed 'the Iron Plantation' because it owned 60 or more black slaves.... According to a local history, the congregants took Woolman's message to heart. Shrewsbury Township, which included Tinton Falls, led the colonies in the number of slaves emancipated by owners during the pre-Revolutionary period. " The name came from Lewis Morris's plantation, Tinton Manor, which employed free white workers and slaves.Hutchinson, Viola L.

The area that is now known as Tinton Falls was originally settled in the late 1600s, probably beginning with the initial land purchases from the Lenni Lenape Native Americans in 1664. Water power and iron ore were likely the incentives that encouraged settlement: shortly after [the land was purchased], a man by the name of James Grover had an ironworks built along the river.  Grover was likely the founder of the community, which, in the 1600s, was named "New Shrewsbury".  At this time, the waterfall was known to be about  high;Gabrelan, Randall.

Grover’s ironworks was the central fixture of the community, and it was one of the oldest built in the country, predated only by buildings in Jamestown and Massachusetts.  In 1675, a half-interest in the ironworks company was purchased by Colonel Lewis Morris, [who obtained a title granting him  along the Shrewsbury River].  Morris also obtained land owned by Bartholomew Applegate, who had built a corn mill on the other side of the river. Morris, who procured the land for iron mining, named his holdings "Tintern Manor," after his family lands in Monmouthshire, England.Barrett, William A. (ed.)

In 1691, Colonel Morris died, leaving the ironworks and Tinton Manor (a corruption of "Tintern Manor") to his nephew of the same name.  By 1714, the ironworks had become less profitable, but mention of a Tinton Falls ironworks can be found as late as 1844. Morris brought in dozens of African slaves to mine the ore resulting in the nickname the "Iron Plantation", with the highest number of slaves being in Tinton Falls at that time in the colony of New Jersey, though in mid-18th century it had the largest number of emancipated slaves in the 13 colonies, as residents followed the preaching of abolitionist John Woolman. In 1693, Tinton Manor and the surrounding lands were defined as part of Shrewsbury Township.  At this time, Shrewsbury included all of the land in eastern Monmouth County.  Shrewsbury Township became Shrewsbury Borough in 1926, after many of the municipalities in eastern Monmouth County split from the township.  In July 1950, Tinton Falls and Wayside left Shrewsbury Borough, renaming themselves the Borough of New Shrewsbury.  To avoid postal confusion and mix-ups with the surrounding borough and township of Shrewsbury, the residents of New Shrewsbury voted to rename the community as "The Borough of Tinton Falls" in 1975.Phalon, Richard.
