    World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history in absolute terms of total dead.. Over 60 million people were killed, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion). The tables below give a detailed country-by-country count of human losses. World War II fatality statistics vary, with estimates of total dead ranging from 50 million to more than 80 million. The higher figure of over 80 million includes deaths from war-related disease and famine. Civilians killed totalled 50 to 55 million, including 19 to 28 million from war-related disease and famine. Total military dead: from 21 to 25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war. Recent historical scholarship has shed new light on the topic of Second World War casualties. Research in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union has caused a revision of estimates of Soviet war dead.Geoffrey A. Hosking (2006). "Rulers and victims: the Russians in the Soviet Union". Harvard University Press. p. 242. ISBN 0-674-02178-9 According to Russian government figures USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million.Michael Ellman and S. Maksudov, Soviet Deaths in the Great Patriotic War: a note – World War II – Europe Asia Studies, July 1994.Andreev EM; Darsky LE; Kharkova TL, Population dynamics: consequences of regular and irregular changes. in Demographic Trends and Patterns in the Soviet Union Before 1991. Routledge. 1993. ISBN 0415101948 In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million.Wojciech Materski and Tomasz Szarota.

Straty osobowe i ofiary represji pod dwiema okupacjami.Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) Warszawa 2009 ISBN 978-83-7629-067-6 The historian Rüdiger Overmans of the German Armed Forces Military History Research Office published a study in 2000 that estimated German military dead and missing at 5.3 million.Rüdiger Overmans. Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Oldenbourg 2000. ISBN 3-486-56531-1 Compiling or estimating the numbers of deaths caused during wars and other violent conflicts is a controversial subject. Historians often put forward many different estimates of the numbers killed during World War II. The authors of the Oxford Companion to World War II maintain that "casualty statistics are notoriously unreliable."I. C. B. Dear  and M. R. D. Foot Oxford Companion to World War II Oxford, 2005 ISBN 0-19-280670-X p. 290 The table below gives data on the number of dead for each country, along with population information to show the relative impact of losses. When scholarly sources differ on the number of deaths in a country, a range of war losses is given, in order to inform readers that the death toll is disputed. Since casualty statistics are sometimes disputed the footnotes to this article present the different estimates by official governmental sources as well as historians. Military figures include battle deaths (KIA) and personnel missing in action (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of prisoners of war in captivity. Civilian casualties include deaths caused by strategic bombing, Holocaust victims, German war crimes, Japanese war crimes, population transfers in the Soviet Union, other war crimes, and deaths due to war related famine and disease. The losses listed here are actual deaths, hypothetical losses due to a decline in births are not included with the total dead. The distinction between military and civilian casualties caused directly by warfare and collateral damage is not always clear cut. For nations that suffered huge losses such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Germany, and Yugoslavia, sources can give only the total estimated population loss caused by the war and a rough estimate of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, crimes against humanity and war-related famine. The casualties listed here include 19 to 25 million war-related famine deaths in the USSR, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, India that are often omitted from other compilations of World War II casualties.John W. Dower War Without Mercy 1986 ISBN 0-394-75172-8R. J. Rummel.  China's Bloody Century . Transaction 1991 ISBN 0-88738-417-X The footnotes give a detailed breakdown of the casualties and their sources, including data on the number of wounded where reliable sources are available. The estimated breakdown for each Soviet Republic of total war dead is as follows  Included in the figures of total war dead for each nation are victims of the Holocaust. The Holocaust is the term generally used to describe the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II. Martin Gilbert estimates 5.7 million (78%) of the 7.3 million Jews in German occupied Europe were Holocaust victims.Martin Gilbert. Atlas of the Holocaust 1988 ISBN 0-688-12364-3 pp. 242–244 Estimates of Holocaust deaths range between 4.9 to 5.9 million Jews.

The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, Columbia University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-231-11200-9, p. 421. The low, high and average percentage figures for deaths of the pre war population have been added.  Some scholars maintain that the definition of the Holocaust should also include the other victims persecuted and killed by the Nazis.A Mosaic of Victims: Non-Jews Persecuted and Murdered by the Nazis. Ed. by Michael Berenbaum New York University Press 1990 ISBN 1-85043-251-1 Estimates of the death toll of non-Jewish victims vary by millions, partly because the boundary between death by persecution and death by starvation and other means in a context of total war is unclear. The following figures are from The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, the authors maintain that "statistics on Gypsy losses are especially unreliable and controversial. These figures (cited below) are based on necessarily rough estimates".Niewyk, Donald L. and Francis Nicosia. The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, Columbia University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-231-11200-9 p. 422.  Included with total war dead are victims of Japanese war crimes.

Wheatcroft, Victims of Stalinism and the Soviet Secret Police: The Comparability and Reliability of the Archival Data-Not the Last Word Europe-Asia Studies Volume 51, Issue 2, 1999 Robert Conquest and Steven Rosefielde have disputed the accuracy of the data from the Soviet archives, maintaining that the demographic data and testimonials by survivors of the Gulag labor camps indicate a higher death toll.Robert Conquest, "Excess deaths and camp numbers: Some comments", Soviet Studies Volume 43, Issue 5, 1991Steven Rosefielde, Red Holocaust, Routledge, 2009 ISBN 0-415-77757-7 Rosefielde believes that the release of the Soviet Archive figures is disinformation generated by the modern KGB.Steven Rosefielde Red Holocaust Routledge, 2009 ISBN 0-415-77757-7 Pages 76 and 77 Rosefielde maintains that the data from the Soviet archives is incomplete; for example, he pointed out that the figures do not include the 22,000 victims of the Katyn massacre.Steven Rosefielde Red Holocaust Routledge, 2009 ISBN 0-415-77757-7 p. 59 Rosefielde's demographic analysis puts the number of excess deaths due to Soviet repression at 2,183,000 in 1939–1940 and 5,458,000 from 1941–1945.Steven Rosefielde Red Holocaust Routledge, 2009 ISBN 0-415-77757-7 p. 179 (Rosefielde's figures were derived by estimating the population from 1939–1945 using hypothetical birth and death rates; he then compares this 1945 estimated population to the actual ending population in 1945. The difference is 31.0 million excess deaths of which 23.4 million are attributed to the war and 7.6 million to Soviet repression) Michael Haynes and Rumy Husun accept the figures from the Soviet archives as being an accurate tally of Stalin's victims, they maintain that the demographic data depicts an underdeveloped Soviet economy and the losses in World War Two rather than indicating a higher death toll in the Gulag labor camps.Michael Haynes A Century Of State Murder?: Death and Policy in Twentieth Century Russia, Pluto Press, 2003. ISBN 0745319300. Pages 62–89. In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated 150,000 Polish citizens were killed due to Soviet repression. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation. Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90,000–100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets.Stephane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard Univ Pr, 1999 ISBN 0-674-07608-7 p. 372 In 2005 Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated the death toll in Soviet hands at 350,000.Poland World War II casualties (in thousands) The Estonian State Commission on Examination of Policies of Repression put civilian deaths due to the Soviet occupation in 1940–1941 at 33,900 including (7,800 deaths) of arrested people, (6,000) deportee deaths, (5,000) evacuee deaths, (1,100) people gone missing and (14,000) conscripted for forced labor. After the reoccupation by the U.S.S.R., 5,000 Estonians died in Soviet prisons during 1944–45.

Of these, approximately 330,000 were fatalities. 2-United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Medical Division (1947) The bombing of Japan killed 333,000 civilians and injured 473,000. Of this total 120,000 died and 160,000 were injured in the atomic bombings, leaving 213,000 dead and 313,000 injured by conventional bombing.United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Medical Division (1947), pp. 143-44 3-The effects of air attack on Japanese urban economy. Summary report (1947) Estimated that 252,769 Japanese were killed and 298,650 injured in the air war. 4-The Effects of strategic bombing on Japanese morale Based on a survey of Japanese households the death toll was put at 900,000 dead and 1.3 million injured, the SBS noted that this figure was subject to a maximum sampling error of 30%. 5-Strategic Bombing Survey The Effects of Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki The most striking result of the atomic bombs was the great number of casualties. The exact number of dead and injured will never be known because of the confusion after the explosions. Persons unaccounted for might have been burned beyond recognition in the falling buildings, disposed of in one of the mass cremations of the first week of recovery, or driven out of the city to die or recover without any record remaining. No sure count of even the prepaid populations existed. Because of the decline in activity in the two port cities, the constant threat of incendiary raids, and the formal evacuation programs of the Government, an unknown number of the inhabitants had either drifter away from the cities or been removed according to plan. In this uncertain situation, estimates of casualties have generally ranged between 100,000 and 180,000 for Hiroshima, and between 50,000 and 100,000 for Nagasaki. The Survey believes the dead at Hiroshima to have been between 70,000 and 80,000, with an equal number injured; at Nagasaki over 35,000 dead and somewhat more than that injured seems the most plausible estimate.

ISBN 0-8047-3615-4 In Cap.17 Alleged and True Population Losses there is a detailed account of the controversies related to Yugoslav war losses. p. 744–750  B. German forces, under express orders from Hitler, fought with a special vengeance against the Serbs, who were considered Untermensch. One of the worst massacres during the German military occupation of Serbia was the Kragujevac massacre.  C. Deliberate acts of reprisal against target populations were perpetrated by all combatants. All sides practiced the shooting of hostages on a large scale. At the end of the war many Ustaše collaborators were killed during the Bleiburg tragedy.  D. The systematic extermination of large numbers of people for political, religious or racial reasons. The most numerous victims were Serbs. The USHMM reports between 77,000 and 99,000 persons were killed at the Jasenovac concentration camp. The genocide of Roma was 40,000 persons.Donald Kendrick, The Destiny of Europe's Gypsies.

Military casualties include deaths of regular military forces from combat as well as non-combat causes. Partisan and resistance fighter deaths are included with military losses. The deaths of prisoners of war in captivity and personnel missing in action are also included with military deaths. Whenever possible the details are given in the footnotes. The armed forces of the various nations are treated as single entities, for example the deaths of Austrians, French and foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe in the Wehrmacht are included with German military losses. The official casualty statistics published by the governments of the United States, France, and the UK do not give the details of the national origin, race  and religion of the losses.

ISBN 1-85367-280-7. page 278 The source for population of the annexed regions of Poland, Romania, the Baltic States and Czechoslovakia is League of Nations’ Yearbook 1942–1944. The territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939 included the Western Ukraine, West Belarus and the Vilnius Region which had a population of about 13.0 million, including about 1,400,000 in territory returned to Poland in 1945 (Białystok region and Zakerzonia). The Polish historian Krystyna Kersten estimated losses of about two million in the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. These losses are included in both the Polish and Russian figures for war dead. The formal transfer of the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union occurred with the Polish–Soviet border agreement of August 1945.

Romanian Jewish Holocaust victims totalled 469,000 in 1939 borders which includes 300,000 in Bessarabia and Bukovina occupied by the U.S.S.R. in 1940. According to Martin Gilbert   Jewish Holocaust victims totalled 8,000 in Italy and 562 in the Italian colony of LibyaMartin Gilbert. Atlas of the Holocaust 1988 ISBN 0-688-12364-3 p. 244 Donald Niewyk maintains that the Holocaust can be defined in four ways: first, that it was the genocide of the Jews alone; second, that there were several parallel Holocausts, one for each of the several groups; third, the Holocaust would include Roma and the handicapped along with the Jews; fourth, it would include all racially motivated German crimes, such as the murder of Soviet prisoners of war, Polish and Soviet civilians, as well as political prisoners, religious dissenters, and homosexuals. Using this definition, the total number of Holocaust victims is between 11 million and 17 million people.Niewyk, Donald L. The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, Columbia University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-231-11200-9 Google Books According to the College of Education of the University of South Florida Approximately 11 million people were killed because of Nazi genocidal policy.

In: Wolfgang Benz (Hg.): Legenden, Lügen, Vorurteile. Ein Wörterbuch zur Zeitgeschichte.

Most estimates of Roma (Gypsies) victims range from 130,000 to 500,000. Ian Hancock, Director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin, has argued in favour of a higher figure of between 500,000 and 1,500,000 Roma dead.Hanock, Ian. "Romanies and the Holocaust: A Reevaluation and an Overview" Stone, D. (ed.) (2004) The Historiography of the Holocaust. Palgrave, Basingstoke and New York. Hancock writes that, proportionately, the death toll equaled "and almost certainly exceed[ed], that of Jewish victims".Hancock, Ian. Jewish Responses to the Porajmos – The Romani Holocaust, Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, University of Minnesota. In a 2010 publication, Ian Hancock stated that he agrees with the view that the number of Romanis killed has been underestimated as a result of being grouped with others in Nazi records under headings such as "remainder to be liquidated", "hangers-on" and "partisans".Danger!

Table A including 2.6 to 3 million Soviet prisoners of war. Ethnic Poles: 1.8 to 1.9 million ethnic Polish civilians were victims during the German occupation (see Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles). Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians: According to Nazi ideology, Slavs were useless sub-humans. As such, their leaders, the Soviet elite, were to be killed and the remainder of the population enslaved or expelled further eastward. As a result, millions of civilians in the Soviet Union were deliberately killed, starved, or worked to death. Contemporary Russian sources use the terms "genocide" and "premeditated extermination" when referring to civilian losses in the occupied USSR. Civilians killed in reprisals during the Soviet partisan war and wartime-related famine account for a major part of the huge toll.Rossiiskaia Akademiia nauk.

In Russian. (These losses are for the entire territory of the USSR in 1941, including Polish territories annexed in 1939–40.) The Cambridge History of Russia puts overall civilian deaths in the Nazi-occupied USSR at 13.7 million persons including 2 million Jews. There were an additional 2.6 million deaths in the interior regions of the Soviet Union. The authors maintain "scope for error in this number is very wide". At least 1 million perished in the wartime GULAG camps or in deportations. Other deaths occurred in the wartime evacuations and due to war related malnutrition and disease in the interior. The authors maintain that both Stalin and Hitler "were both responsible but in different ways for these deaths", and "In short the general picture of Soviet wartime losses suggests a jigsaw puzzle. The general outline is clear: people died in colossal numbers but in many different miserable and terrible circumstances. But individual pieces of the puzzle do not fit well; some overlap and others are yet to be found".Perrie, Maureen (2006), The Cambridge History of Russia: The twentieth century, Cambridge University Press(2006), pp. 225–227, ISBN 0-521-81144-9 Bohdan Wytwycky maintained that civilian losses of 3.0 million Ukrainians and 1.4 million Belarusians "were racially motivated".Bohdan Wytwycky,The Other Holocaust: Many Circles of Hell The Novak Report, 1980Niewyk, Donald L.

Homosexuals: According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum "Between 1933 and 1945 the police arrested an estimated 100,000 men as homosexuals. Most of the 50,000 men sentenced by the courts spent time in regular prisons, and between 5,000 and 15,000 were interned in concentration camps." They also noted that There are no known statistics for the number of homosexuals who died in the camps. Other victims of Nazi persecution: Between 1,000 to 2,000 Roman Catholic clergy, about 1,000 Jehovah's Witnesses, and an unknown number of FreemasonsUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Holocaust Encyclopedia "Freemasonry Under the Nazi Regime" perished in Nazi prisons and camps. "The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder." During the Nazi era Communists, Socialists, Social Democrats, and trade union leaders were victims of Nazi persecution. Serbs: (See World War II persecution of Serbs.) The numbers of Serbs persecuted by the Ustaše is the subject of much debate and estimates vary widely. Yad Vashem estimates over 500,000 murdered, 250,000 expelled and 200,000 forcibly converted to Catholicism.– Croatia, Yad Vashem, Shoah Resource Center The estimate of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is that the Ustaše authorities murdered between 320,000 and 340,000 ethnic Serb residents of Croatia and Bosnia during the period of Ustaše rule, out of which between 45,000 to 52,000 were murdered in the Jasenovac concentration camp. According to the Wiesenthal Center at the camps at Jasenovac and Stara Gradiska at least 90,000 Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and anti-fascist Croatians perished at the hands of the Ustashe.http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=4442245&ct=5851813#.VKbzIvldUXs According to Yugoslav sources published in the Tito era the estimates of the number of Serb victims range from 200,000 to at least 600,000 persons.Vladimir Dedijer, History of Yugoslavia McGraw-Hill Inc.,US, 1975 ISBN 0-07-016235-2 Page 582 R.

He estimated total air raid deaths at 353,000. Overy maintains that the German estimates are based on incorrect speculations for losses during the last three months of the war when there was a gap in the record keeping system. He points out that the figures for air raid dead in the last three months of the war were estimated in the West German figures from 1956 at 300,000 people which he believes is not plausible. The official figures include an inflated total of 60,000 in the Bombing of Dresden and the inclusion of refugees fleeing westward. The West German government in made a rough estimate in 1956 of 20,000 civilians killed during the 1945 military campaign in current post war German borders, not including the former German territories in Poland. However, there is a more recent estimate of 22,000 civilians killed during the fighting in Berlin only.

German historians Hans Henning Hahn and Eva Hahn have published a detailed study of the flight and expulsions. They maintain that figures related to flight and expulsion have been manipulated by the German government due to political pressure. The Hahn's believe the official German figure of 2 million deaths is an historical myth, lacking foundation. They place the ultimate blame for the mass flight and expulsion on the wartime policy of the Nazis in Eastern Europe. The Hahn's maintain that the 473,013 confirmed deaths is a correct accounting of the losses. Most of these losses occurred during the Nazi organized flight and evacuation during the war, and the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union; they point out that there are 80,522 confirmed deaths in the postwar internment camps.Hans Henning Hahn & Eva Hahn, Die Vertreibung im deutschen Erinnern.

Overmans did however provide a critical analysis of the previous studies by German government of the human losses in the expulsions. Overmans maintains that these studies lack adequate support, he maintains that a figure of 500,000 expulsion dead is credible and that there are more arguments for the lower figures rather than the higher figures, he believes that new research is needed to determine the correct balance of the human losses in the expulsions.  According to Overmans the figure of 1.9 million missing persons reported by the search service is unreliable because it includes military dead and persons of dubious German ancestry who were not expelled after the war but remained in eastern Europe, also the figures for expellees living in the GDR was understated.Die Toten des Zweiten Weltkriegs in Deutschland.

German historian Ingo Haar  called into question the validity of the official government figure of 2.0 million expulsion deaths in a 2006 article in the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Since then Haar has published three articles in academic journals that covered the background of the research by the West German government on the expulsions. According to Haar the numbers were set too high for postwar political reasons. Haar's research indicates that all reasonable estimates of deaths from expulsions lie between around 500,000 and 600,000, he maintains that deaths due to disease, hunger and other conditions are already included in these numbers.Ursprünge, Arten und Folgen des Konstrukts "Bevölkerung" vor, im und nach dem "Dritten Reich" Zur Geschichte der deutschen Bevölkerungswissenschaft: Ingo Haar Die deutschen ›Vertreibungsverluste‹ – Forschungsstand, Kontexte und Probleme, Ursprünge, Arten und Folgen des Konstrukts "Bevölkerung" vor, im und nach dem "Dritten Reich", Berlin: Springer, 2009; ISBN 978-3-531-16152-5Herausforderung Bevölkerung: zu Entwicklungen des modernen Denkens über die Bevölkerung vor, im und nach dem Dritten Reich Ingo Haar, Bevölkerungsbilanzen" und "Vertreibungsverluste.

A joint Czech–German Historical Commission determined that between 15,000 and 30,000 Germans perished in the expulsions. The commission found that the demographic estimates by the German government of 220,000 to 270,000 civilian deaths due to expulsions from Czechoslovakia were based on faulty data. The Commission determined that the demographic estimates by the German government counted as missing 90,000 ethnic Germans assimilated into the Czech population; military deaths were understated and that the 1950 census data used to compute the demographic losses was unreliable.Hoensch, Jörg K. und Hans Lemberg, Begegnung und Konflikt.

Nitschke contrasted the estimate of 1.6 million deaths in Poland reported by the West German government in the 1950s with the figure of 400,000 ( in Poland only) that was disclosed in 1989. According to Nitschke most of the civilian deaths occurred during the flight and evacuation during the war, the deportation to the U.S.S.R. for forced labor, and after the resettlement in the Soviet occupation zone in post war Germany.Bernadetta Nitschke.

Polish historians  and  believe that between 600,000 and 1.2 million German civilians perished during the wartime evacuations.  The main causes of death were cold, stress, and bombing .Witold Sienkiewicz & Grzegorz Hryciuk, Wysiedlenia, wypędzenia i ucieczki 1939–1959: atlas ziem Polski: Polacy, Żydzi, Niemcy, Ukraińcy, Warsaw: Demart, 2008, p. 170, Określa je wielkosciami między 600tys. a 1.2 mln zmarłych i zabitych.

According to Sienkiewicz and Hryciuk between 200,000-250,000 persons were held in postwar Polish internment camps and between 15,000-60,000 perished.Witold Sienkiewicz & Grzegorz Hryciuk, Wysiedlenia, wypędzenia i ucieczki 1939–1959: atlas ziem Polski: Polacy, Żydzi, Niemcy, Ukraińcy, Warsaw: Demart, 2008, p. 187 German government figures of war losses do not include the increase in natural deaths with war casualties. The German economist Bruno Gleitze from the German Institute for Economic Research estimated that there were 1,200,000 excess deaths caused by the harsh conditions in Germany during and after the war. Gleitze estimated 400,000 excess deaths during the war and 800,000 in post war Germany The West German Statistisches Bundesamt put the actual deaths from 1939-1946 due to natural causes at 7,130,000 persons, the demographic study by Peter Marschalck estimated the expected deaths in peacetime due to natural causes of 5,900,000 persons, a difference of 1,230,000 excess deaths. In Allied-occupied Germany the shortage of food was an acute problem in 1946–47. The average kilocalorie intake per day was only 1,600 to 1,800, an amount insufficient for long-term health.Alan S. Milward, The Reconstruction of Western Europe Greece The Greek government is planning to claim reparations from Germany for war damages.Vast Greek war claims against Germany explode like a 'time-bomb', The Telegraph March 22, 2014 The Greek National Council for Reparations from Germany reports the following casualties during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. Military dead 35,077, including: 13,327 killed in the Greco-Italian War of 1940–41; 1,100 with the Greek Royal Forces in the Middle East, and 20,650 partisan deaths. Civilian deaths 171,845, including: 56,225 executed by Axis forces; 105,000 dead in German concentration camps (including Jews); 7,120 deaths due to bombing; 3,500 merchant marine dead;  600,000 Famine deaths during the war A study published by Cambridge University Press in 2010 estimated that Greece suffered approximately 300,000 deaths during the Axis occupation as a result of famine and malnutrition Gregory Frumkin, who was throughout its existence editor of the Statistical Year-Book of the League of Nations gave the following assessment of Greek losses in the war. He points out that that "the data on Greek war losses are frequently divergent and even inconsistent". His estimates for Greek losses are as follows: the war dead included 20,000 military deaths in the Greco-Italian War of 1940–41, 60,000 non-Jewish civilians, 20,000 non-Jewish deportees, 60,000 Jews and 140,000 famine deaths during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II.Gregory Frumkin. Population Changes in Europe Since 1939, Geneva 1951. pp. 89–91 In campaigns against the Greek Resistance the German occupiers engaged in a policy of reprisals against civilians, the most notorious were the Distomo massacre and the Massacre of Kalavryta. According to the German historian  at least 25,000 but perhaps even more civilians were killed in mass executions. Pohl maintains that about 1 million persons (14% of the population) were displaced in the campaigns against the Greek Resistance  because their homes were destroyed or were expelled and became refugeesDieter Pohl, Verfolgung und Massenmord in der NS-Zeit 1933–1945, WBG (Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft), 2003, ISBN 3534151585, pp. 123-124 1 Guam Guam was a United States administered territory during World War Two. The local Chamorro people were granted U.S. citizenship in the Guam Organic Act of 1950. According to an official U.S. report during the Battle of Guam on December 8–10, 4 Guam local military personnel and 3 Guam residents were killed in the battle.George J. McMillin, Captain, USN Surrender of Guam to the Japanese However, Japanese sources reported 40–50 of the local population killed.Thomas Wilds, "The Japanese Seizure of Guam", Marine Corps Gazette, July, 1955 Between 1,000 to 2,000 Chamorro people were killed or otherwise died of abuse and mistreatment during the Japanese occupation of Guam from December 10, 1941, to August 10, 1944 including an estimated 600 civilians who were massacred by the Japanese during the Battle of Guam (1944). Hungary Tamás Stark of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences has provided the following assessment of Hungarian losses. Military losses were 300,000 to 310,000 including 110–120,000 killed in action and 200,000 in Soviet POW and labor camps and 20-25,000 Jews in Hungarian military labor service. About 210,000 were from Hungary in the 1939 borders and about 100,000 men who were conscripted from the annexed territories of Greater Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. Civilian dead within the borders of present-day Hungary included 220,000 Hungarian Jews killed in the Holocaust and 44,000 deaths from military operations Iceland Confirmed losses of civilian sailors due to German attacks and mines. India India which was a British Colony during World War II included the present day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. India under British administration is sometimes referred to as the British Raj. The war dead of 87,028 listed here are those reported by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission,Commonwealth War Graves Commission Annual Report 2013-2014, page 44. Figures include identified burials and those commemorated by name on memorials. Gurkhas recruited from Nepal fought with the British Indian Army during the Second World War. Gurkha casualties with the British Indian Army can be broken down as: 8,985 killed or missing and 23,655 wounded.Parker, John. (2005). The Gurkhas: The Inside Story of the World's Most Feared Soldiers. Headline Book Publishing. ISBN 978-0-7553-1415-7 p. 250 The preliminary 1945 data for Indian losses was, killed 24,338, missing 11,754, wounded 64,354 and POW 79,489. Out of 60,000 Indian Army POWs taken at the Fall of Singapore, 11,000 died in captivity. The pro-Japanese Indian National Army lost 2,615 dead and missing. John W. Dower estimated 1.5 million civilian deaths in the Bengal famine of 1943. Amartya Sen currently the Lamont University Professor at Harvard University has recently estimated that a figure of 2.0 to 2.5 million fatalities may be more accurate. Iran Losses during allied occupation in 1941. Iraq Losses during Anglo-Iraqi War and UK occupation in 1941. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum between 150-180 Jews were killed in the Farhud pogram in 1941  Ireland Despite being neutral, Ireland suffered casualties serving as volunteers in the UK Armed Forces as well as civilians killed by accidental bombings and U-boat attacks by Germany. According to the Reform Group between 1939–1945 an estimated 70,000 citizens of neutral Ireland (the Republic of Ireland or Eire) served in the British armed forces. In April 1995 Taoiseach John Bruton spoke at Islandbridge and paid tribute to the 150,000 Irish people North and South who "volunteered to fight against Nazi tyranny in Europe, at least 10,000 of whom were killed while serving in British uniforms ... In recalling their bravery, we are recalling a shared experience of Irish and British people ... We remember a British part of the inheritance of all who live in Ireland". The civilian death figure includes 33 Irish merchantmen were killed when a U-Boat torpedoed the SS Irish Pine (1919) and deaths caused by the presumably accidental bombing of Ireland in three instances. Italy Updated studies (2010) by the Ufficio dell'Albo d'Oro of the Italian Ministry of Defence, p. 4 have revised the military deaths to 319,207, of which 246,432 belonged to the Army, 31,347 to the Navy, 13,210 to the Air Force, 15,197 to the Partisan formations and 13,021 to the armed forces of the Italian Social Republic. The Italian government issued an accounting of the war dead in 1957, they broke out the losses before and after the Armistice with Italy: military dead and missing 291,376 (204,376 pre-armistice and 87,030 post armistice).Civilian dead and missing at 153,147 (123,119 post armistice) including in air raids 61,432 (42,613 post armistice).Roma:Instituto Centrale Statistica'  Morti E Dispersi Per Cause Belliche Negli Anni 1940–45  Rome 1957 A brief summary of data from this report can be found online.

Dower  an error which appears in English language sources puts the total killed in air raids at 668,000, a figure which includes dead, missing and injured. A Japanese academic study published in 1979 by The Committee for the Compilation of Materials on Damage Caused by the Atomic Bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki puts the total dead in the atomic attacks at 140,000 (± 10,000) in Hiroshima and 70,000 (± 10,000) in Nagasaki.  According to the authors of the report a study of atomic bomb related casualties in Hiroshima in December 1945 was "lost and not discovered until twenty years later" , they cited a similar survey in Nagasaki done in December 1945. The authors maintain that the lower casualty figures published in the immediate post war era did not include military personnel and missing persons.Eisei Ishikawa, David L. Swain, Committee for the Compilation of Materials on Damage Caused by the Atomic Bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Hiroshima and Nagasaki The Physical Medical and Social Effects of the Atomic Bombings, Basic Books, 1981, ISBN 046502985X (English translation of Japanese study published in 1979 The figures of dead in the atomic attacks from this study were cited by John W. Dower  in his 'War Without Mercy John W. Dower War Without Mercy 1986 ISBN 0-394-75172-8 pp. 297–299 According to the World Nuclear Association, "In Hiroshima, of a resident civilian population of 250,000 it was estimated that 45,000 died on the first day and a further 19,000 during the subsequent four months. In Nagasaki, out of a population of 174,000, 22,000 died on the first day and another 17,000 within four months. Unrecorded deaths of military personnel and foreign workers may have added considerably to these figures. About 15 square kilometers (over 50%) of the two cities was destroyed. It is impossible to estimate the proportion of these 103,000 deaths, or of the further deaths in military personnel, which were due to radiation exposure rather than to the very high temperatures and blast pressures caused by the explosions." They also noted that "To the 103,000 deaths from the blast or acute radiation exposure at Hiroshima and Nagasaki have since been added those due to radiation-induced cancers and leukemia, which amounted to some 400 within 30 years, and which may ultimately reach about 550. (Some 93,000 exposed survivors were still being monitored 50 years later.)" The Radiation Effects Research Foundation puts the number of deaths (within two to four months), in Hiroshima at 90,000 to 166,000 persons and in Nagasaki at 60,000 to 80,000 persons. They noted that deaths caused by the atomic bombings include those that occurred on the days of the bombings due to the overwhelming force and heat of the blasts, as well as later deaths attributable to radiation exposure. The total number of deaths is not known precisely because military personnel records in each city were destroyed; entire families perished, leaving no one to report deaths; and unknown numbers of forced laborers were present in both citiesRadiation Effects Research Foundation How many people died as a result of the atomic bombings? The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey published the following estimates of Japanese casualties due to U.S. bombing. John W.

They maintain that the official statistics include those persons who were missing and presumed dead, but actually remained abroad in the West and the USSR after the war.Czesław Łuczak, Szanse i trudnosci bilansu demograficznego Polski w latach 1939–1945. Dzieje Najnowsze Rocznik XXI, 1994 In August 2009, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated 150,000 Polish citizens were killed due to Soviet repression. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation. Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90,000–100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets. In 2005 Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated the death toll in Soviet hands at 350,000. An earlier estimate made in 1987 by Franciszek Proch of the Polish Association of Former Political Prisoners of Nazi and Soviet Concentration Camps estimated the total dead due to the Soviet occupation at 1,050,000.Franciszek Proch, Poland's Way of the Cross, New York 1987 Poland lost a total of 139,800 regular soldiers and 100,000 Polish resistance movement fighters during the war.

According to the Russian demographer   there are a wide range of estimates for total war dead by Russian scholars. He cites figures of total war dead that range from 21.8 million up to 28.0 million. Rybakovsky points out that the variables that are used to compute losses are by no means certain and are currently disputed by historians in Russia.  Some Russian historians put the figure as high as 46.0 million by counting the population deficit due to children not born during the war. Based on the birth rate prior to the war there is a population shortfall of about 20 million births in 1946, some would have been born but died during the war and the balance were never born. The figures for the number of children born during the war who did not survive as well as those unborn are rough estimates.L L Rybakovsky Casualties of the USSR in the Great Patriotic War (In Russian) Sotsiologicheskie issiedovaniya, 2000.  № 6. The official Russian Ministry of Defense figure for military total dead and missing from 1941 to 1945 is 8,668,400; including 6,330,000 killed in action or died of wounds and 556,000 dead from non-combat causes; 500,000 MIA and 1,283,000 dead and missing POW. Official Russian figures indicate 4,559,000 POWs and missing, out of which about 500,000 missing were killed in battle, 939,700 were conscripted back into the Soviet army during the war as territories were being liberated, 1,836,000 liberated POWs are known to have returned to the USSR after the war, this leaves 1,103,300 POW presumed dead and another 180,000 liberated POWs who most likely emigrated to other countries after the war. Richard Overy has noted that "The official figures themselves must be viewed critically, given the difficulty of knowing in the chaos of 1941 and 1942 exactly who had been killed, wounded or even conscripted".Richard Overy, Russia's War: A History of the Soviet Effort: 1941–1945, Penguin Books, 1998, ISBN 0-14-027169-4 p. XV The official Russian statistics issued in 1993  for military dead do not include an additional estimated 500,000 conscripted reservists missing or killed before being listed on active strength, 1,000,000 civilians treated as POW by Germany; and an estimated 150,000 militia and 250,000 Soviet partisan dead, who are considered civilian war losses in the official figures.Vadim Erlikman. Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke: spravochnik. Moscow 2004.

Mikhalev of the History department of Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University published a critical analysis of the official Russian wartime casualty statistics, he estimated actual Soviet military war dead at more than 10.9 million persons.

ISBN 86-01-01928-5. pp. 172–189 The U.S. Bureau of the Census published a report in 1954 that concluded that Yugoslav war-related deaths were 1,067,000. The U.S. Bureau of the Census noted that the official Yugoslav government figure of 1.7 million war dead was overstated because it "was released soon after the war and was estimated without the benefit of a postwar census". A recent study by Vladimir Žerjavić estimates total war related deaths at 1,027,000 which included military losses of 237,000 Yugoslav partisans, Chetniks, and 209,000 Ustaše. Civilian dead of 581,000, including 57,000 Jews. Losses of the Yugoslav Republics were: Bosnia 316,000; Serbia 273,000; Croatia 271,000; Slovenia 33,000; Montenegro 27,000; Macedonia 17,000; and killed abroad 80,000. Bogoljub Kočović a Yugoslav statistician,calculated that the actual war losses were 1,014,000. The late Jozo Tomasevich, Professor Emeritus of Economics at San Francisco State University, believes that the calculations of Kočović and Žerjavić "seem to be free of bias, we can accept them as reliable".Tomasevich, Jozo.
