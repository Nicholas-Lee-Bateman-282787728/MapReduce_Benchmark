     Fred McFeely Rogers (March 20, 1928&nbsp;– February 27, 2003) was an American television personality, puppeteer, educator, Presbyterian minister, composer, songwriter, author, and activist. Rogers was most famous for creating, hosting, and composing the theme music for the educational preschool television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1968–2001), which featured his gentle, soft-spoken personality and directness to his audiences. Initially educated to be a minister, Rogers was displeased with the way television addressed children and made an effort to change this when he began to write for and perform on local Pittsburgh-area shows dedicated to youth. WQED developed his own show in 1968 and it was distributed nationwide by Eastern Educational Television Network. Over the course of three decades on television, Fred Rogers became an icon of American children's entertainment and education. He was also known for his advocacy of various public causes. His testimony before a lower court in favor of fair use recording of television shows to play at another time (now known as time shifting) was cited in a U.S. Supreme Court decision on the Betamax case, and he gave now-famous testimony to a U.S. Senate committee, advocating government funding for children's television. Rogers received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, some forty honorary degrees, and a Peabody Award. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame, was recognized by two Congressional resolutions, and was ranked No. 35 among TV Guide's Fifty Greatest TV Stars of All Time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1996 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=December 14–20 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate=October 19, 2011 }}</ref> Several buildings and artworks in Pennsylvania are dedicated to his memory, and the [[Smithsonian Institution]] displays one of his [[trademark look|trademark]] sweaters as a "Treasure of American History".  == Personal life == Rogers was born in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], 40&nbsp;miles (65&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Pittsburgh]], to James and Nancy Rogers; he had one sister, Elaine.<ref name="Owen" /> Early in life he spent much of his free time with his maternal grandfather, Fred McFeely, who had an interest in music.

He entered [[seminary]] after college; but, after his first experience as a viewer, he wanted to explore the potential of the medium.<ref name="Junod" /> In an interview with [[CNN]] in his later years, Rogers stated, "I went into television because I hated it so, and I thought there's some way of using this fabulous instrument to nurture those who would watch and listen."<ref name="Millman" />  He thus applied for a job at [[NBC]] in New York City in 1951 and was hired because of his music degree.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Rogers spent three years working on the production staffs for such music-centered programming as ''NBC Opera Theater''. He also worked on [[Gabby Hayes]]' show for children. Ultimately, Rogers decided that commercial television's reliance on advertisement and merchandising undermined its ability to educate or enrich young audiences, so he quit NBC.  In 1954, he began working at [[WQED (TV)|WQED]], a Pittsburgh [[public television]] station, as a [[puppeteer]] on a local children's show ''The Children's Corner''. For the next seven years,{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} he worked with host [[Josie Carey]] in unscripted [[live TV]], developing many of the puppets, characters, and music used in his later work, such as King Friday XIII, and curious X the Owl.  Rogers began wearing his famous [[sneaker (footwear)|sneakers]] when he found them to be quieter than his work shoes as he moved about behind the set. He was also the voices of King Friday XIII and Queen Sara Saturday (named after his wife), rulers of the neighborhood, as well as X the Owl, Henrietta Pussycat, Daniel Striped Tiger, Lady Elaine Fairchilde, and Larry Horse. The show won a [[Sylvania Award]]<ref name="Schultz">{{cite web|url=http://uv201.com/TV_Pages/sylvania_award.htm|title=Sylvania Award|last=Schultz|first=Mike|work=uv201.com|accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> for best children's show, and was briefly broadcast nationally on NBC.  During his off hours, he would leave the WQED studios during his lunch breaks to study [[theology]] at the nearby [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary]]. Rogers, however, was not interested in preaching; and, after his ordination, he was specifically charged to continue his work with Children's Television.<ref>http://www.fredrogers.org/fred-rogers/bio/</ref> He had also done work at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s program in Child Development and Child Care.  In 1963, Rogers moved to [[Toronto]], where he was contracted by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) to develop his debut in front of the camera, the 15-minute children's program ''Misterogers'',<ref name="Williams">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=rogersfred|title=Fred McFeely Rogers|last=Williams|first=Suzanne|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> which though popular with children ran just three seasons. Many of his famous set pieces—Trolley, [[Eiffel Tower]], the 'tree', and 'castle'—were created by CBC designers. While in Canada, Rogers brought his friend and [[understudy]] [[Ernie Coombs]], who would go on to create ''[[Mr. Dressup]]'', a very successful and long-running children's show in Canada, and similar in many ways to ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood''. ''Mr. Dressup'' also used some of the songs that would be featured on Rogers' later program. The two of them co-starred on ''[[Butternut Square]]'' on [[CBC Television|CBC TV]] between October 19, 1964 and February 10, 1967.  In 1966, Rogers acquired the rights to his program from the CBC and moved the show to WQED in Pittsburgh, where he had worked on ''The Children's Corner''. He developed the new show for the [[Eastern Educational Network]]. Stations that carried the program were limited but did include educational stations in Boston, Washington, D.C., and New York City.  After returning to Pittsburgh, Rogers attended the Sixth Presbyterian Church in the [[Squirrel Hill]] neighborhood.<ref name="Rodgers-Melnick">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030504mccall0504p4.asp|title=Liberal pastor retires after long run in city|last=Rodgers-Melnick|first=Ann|date=May 4, 2003|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref>  Distribution of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' began on February 19, 1968. The following year, the show moved to [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] (Public Broadcasting Service). In 1971, Rogers formed Family Communications, Inc. (FCI), and the company established offices in the WQED building in Pittsburgh. Initially, the company served solely as the production arm of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'', but it now develops and produces an array of children's programming and educational materials.  === ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' === [[File:Fred Rogers sweater.jpg|right|thumb|A sweater worn by Rogers, on display in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s Museum of American History.]] {{Main|Mister Rogers' Neighborhood}}  ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' began airing in 1968 and ran for 895 episodes; the last set of new episodes was taped in December 2000 and began airing in August 2001. At its peak, in 1985, 8% of U.S households tuned into the show.<ref name="DeFranceso" /> * Each episode began the same way: Mister Rogers is seen coming home, singing his theme song "Won't You Be My Neighbor?", and changing into [[Sneaker (footwear)|sneakers]] and a zippered [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] sweater (he stated in an interview for Emmy TV that all of his sweaters were knitted by his mother).<ref>[http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/fred-rogers# Archive of American Television: Fred Rogers]</ref> * In a typical episode, Rogers might have an earnest conversation with his television audience, interact with live guests, take a [[field trip]] to such places as a bakery or a [[music store]], or watch a short film. * Typical video subjects included demonstrations of how inanimate objects work, such as [[bulldozers]], or how they are manufactured, such as [[crayons]]. * Each episode included a trip to Rogers' "[[Neighborhood of Make-Believe]]" featuring a trolley with its own chiming theme song, a castle, and the kingdom's citizens, including King Friday XIII. The subjects discussed in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe often allowed further development of themes discussed in Mister Rogers' "real" neighborhood. * Mister Rogers often fed his fish during episodes. They were originally named Fennel and Frieda. * Typically, each week's episode explored a major theme, such as going to school for the first time. * Originally, most episodes ended with a song entitled "Tomorrow", and Friday episodes looked forward to the week ahead with an adapted version of "It's Such a Good Feeling". In later seasons, all episodes ended with "Feeling".  Visually, the presentation of the show was very simple, and it did not feature the animation or fast pace of other children's shows, which Rogers thought of as "bombardment".<ref name="Senate testimony video" /> Rogers also believed in not acting out a different persona on camera compared to how he acted off camera, stating that "One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody is the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a phony a mile away."<ref name="Owen 2000">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20001112rogers2.asp|last=Owen|first=Rob|date=November 12, 2000|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] Magazine|accessdate=March 20, 2011|title=There goes the Neighborhood: Mister Rogers will make last episodes of show in December}}</ref> Rogers composed almost all of the music on the program.<ref group="note">Bits of incidental music, such as improvisations from members of the orchestra or music from guests to the program, weren't composed by Rogers. The recurring iconic songs, however, were all Rogers' work.</ref> He wanted to teach children to love themselves and others, and he addressed common childhood fears with comforting songs and [[sketch comedy|skits]]. For example, one of his famous songs explains how a child cannot be pulled down the bathtub drain because he or she will not fit. He even once took a trip to the [[Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh]] to show children that a hospital is not a place to fear. During the [[Gulf War]] (1990–91), he assured his audience that all children in the neighborhood would be well cared for and asked parents to promise to take care of their own children. The message was aired again by PBS during the media storm that preceded the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].  === Other television work === In 1994, Rogers created another one-time special for PBS called ''Fred Rogers' Heroes'' which consisted of documentary portraits of four real-life people whose work helped make their communities better. Rogers, uncharacteristically dressed in a suit and tie, hosted in wraparound segments which did not use the "Neighborhood" set.  For a time, Rogers produced specials for parents as a precursor to the subject of the week on the ''Neighborhood'' called "Mister Rogers Talks To Parents About ''[topic]''". Rogers didn't host those specials, but instead invited news announcers, such as [[Joan Lunden]] (who hosted the Conflict special), to take on the emcee duties in front of a gallery of parents while Rogers answered questions from them. These specials were made to prepare parents for questions their children might ask after watching the episodes on the topic of the week.  The only time Rogers appeared on television as someone other than himself was in 1996, when he played a preacher on one episode of ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]].''<ref name="DeFranceso" />  In the mid-1980s, the [[Burger King]] fast-food chain lampooned Rogers' image with an actor called "Mr. Rodney", imitating Rogers' television character.<ref name="Edwards">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v18/ai_3275741/|title=Burger King ad strategy pushes unit volumes near $1M|last=Edwards|first=Joe|date=May 21, 1984|work=Nation's Restaurant News|accessdate=2009-05-16}}</ref> Rogers found the character's pitching fast food as confusing to children, and called a press conference in which he stated that he did not endorse the company's use of his character or likeness (Rogers did no commercial endorsements of any kind throughout his career, though over the years he acted as a pitchman for several non-profit organizations dedicated to learning). The chain publicly apologized for the ''faux pas'', and pulled the ads.<ref>Dougherty, Philip (May 10, 1984).

Would you just take, along with me, ten seconds to think of the people who have helped you become who you are. Ten seconds of silence."  And then he lifted his wrist, looked at the audience, looked at his watch, and said, "I'll watch the time." There was, at first, a small whoop from the crowd, a giddy, strangled hiccup of laughter, as people realized that he wasn't kidding, that Mister Rogers was not some convenient eunuch, but rather a man, an authority figure who actually expected them to do what he asked. And so they did. One second, two seconds, three seconds—and now the jaws clenched, and the bosoms heaved, and the mascara ran, and the tears fell upon the beglittered gathering like rain leaking down a crystal chandelier.

His goal was to support funding for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], in response to significant proposed cuts. In about six minutes of testimony, Rogers spoke of the need for social and emotional education that public television provided. He passionately argued that alternative television programming like his ''Neighborhood'' helped encourage children to become happy and productive citizens, sometimes opposing less positive messages in media and in popular culture. He even recited the lyrics to one of his songs.  The chairman of the subcommittee, [[John O. Pastore]], was not previously familiar with Rogers' work, and was sometimes described as impatient. However, he reported that the testimony had given him goosebumps, and declared, "I think it's wonderful. Looks like you just earned the $20&nbsp;million." The subsequent congressional appropriation, for 1971, increased PBS funding from $9&nbsp;million to $22&nbsp;million.<ref name=Testimony>{{cite web|title=Senate Committee Hearing|url=http://exhibit.fredrogerscenter.org/advocacy-for-children/videos/view/969/|work=Fred Rogers Beyond the Neighborhood|publisher=Fred Rogers Center|accessdate=27 May 2014|year=1969}}</ref>  === VCR ===  During the controversy surrounding the introduction of the household [[videocassette recorder|VCR]], Rogers was involved in supporting the manufacturers of VCRs in court. His 1979 [[testimony]] in the case ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]'' noted that he did not object to home recording of his television programs, for instance, by families in order to watch together at a later time. This testimony contrasted with the views of others in the television industry who objected to home recording or believed that devices to facilitate it should be taxed or regulated.  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] considered the testimony of Rogers in its decision that held that the [[Betamax]] video recorder did not [[Copyright infringement|infringe copyright]]. The Court stated that his views were a notable piece of evidence "that many [television] producers are willing to allow private time-shifting to continue" and even quoted his testimony in a footnote:  {{quote|Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the "Neighborhood" at hours when some children cannot use it ... I have always felt that with the advent of all of this new technology that allows people to tape the "Neighborhood" off-the-air, and I'm speaking for the "Neighborhood" because that's what I produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of their family's television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been "You are an important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions." Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important.<ref name="Supreme Court">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/464_US_417.htm#464us417n27|title=SONY CORP.
