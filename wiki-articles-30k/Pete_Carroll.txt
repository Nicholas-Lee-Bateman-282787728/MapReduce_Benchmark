 Peter Clay Carroll (born September 15, 1951) is an American football coach who is the head coach and executive vice president of the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL).  He is a former head coach of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, and the USC Trojans of the University of Southern California (USC).  Carroll is one of only three football coaches who have won both a Super Bowl and a college football national championship.The other two are Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer.  See Willis, George (February 1, 2014) "Carrol Could Join Rare Company with Super Bowl Title". New York Post. (Retrieved January 27, 2015.) Born in San Francisco, California, Carroll is the son of Rita (née Bann) and James Edward "Jim" Carroll. Two of his paternal great-grandparents were Irish immigrants, and his maternal grandparents were Croatians who emigrated from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/celeb/carroll.htm Carroll attended Redwood High School in Larkspur. After being an athlete in childhood, his lack of physical growth as a teenager caused him frustration in high school sports; weighing  as an incoming freshman, he was required to bring a special doctor's clearance in order to try out for football. He was a multi-sport star in football (playing quarterback, wide receiver, and defensive back), basketball, and baseball, earning the school's Athlete of the Year honors as a senior in 1969; forty years later he was inducted into the charter class of the Redwood High School Athletic Hall of Fame in April 2009.Adam Rose, Pete Carroll: The high school years, latimes.com, April 8, 2009, Accessed April 10, 2009; In his college coaching days, Carroll would go to downtown L.A. and talk to the bloods and crips, he was trying to be a mentor for gang members and influence them positively.

After graduation, Carroll tried out for the Honolulu Hawaiians of the World Football League at their training camp in Riverside but did not make the team due to shoulder problems combined with his small size.Mike Sager, Big Balls Pete Carroll, Esquire, September 11, 2009. Retrieved September 22, 2009. To make ends meet, he found a job selling roofing materials in the Bay Area, but he found he wasn't good at it and soon moved on; it would be his only non-football-related job. Carroll's energetic and positive personality made a good impression on his head coach, Chester Caddas. When Caddas found out Carroll was interested in coaching, he offered him a job as a graduate assistant on his staff at Pacific. Carroll agreed and enrolled as a graduate student, earning a secondary teaching credential and Master's degree in physical education in 1976, while serving as a graduate assistant for three years and working with the wide receivers and secondary defenders. The assistants at Pacific during this time included a number of other future successful coaches, including Greg Robinson, Jim Colletto, Walt Harris, Ted Leland, and Bob Cope. He was inducted into the Pacific Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995. After graduating from Pacific, Carroll's colleague Bob Cope was hired by the University of Arkansas and he convinced Lou Holtz, then the head coach of the Razorbacks, to also hire Carroll. Carroll spent the 1977 season as a graduate assistant working with the secondary under Cope, making $182 a month.Rhett Bollinger, Back where they started, Daily Trojan, August 31, 2006 During his season with Arkansas, he met his future offensive line coach Pat Ruel, also a graduate assistant, as well as the future head coach of the Razorbacks Houston Nutt, who was a backup quarterback. Arkansas' Defensive Coordinator at the time, Monte Kiffin, would be a mentor to Carroll; Carroll's wife Glena would help babysit Monte's two-year-old son Lane Kiffin, who would later become Carroll's offensive coordinator at USC and then head coach of the Oakland Raiders and Tennessee Volunteers, and the head coach of USC. The Razorbacks won the 1978 Orange Bowl that season. The following season, Carroll moved to Iowa State University, where he was again an assistant working on the secondary under Earle Bruce. When Bruce moved on to Ohio State University, he brought Carroll, who acted as an assistant coach in charge of the secondary. The Ohio State squad made it to the 1980 Rose Bowl where they lost to USC. When Monte Kiffin was named Head Coach of North Carolina State University, he brought Carroll in as his defensive coordinator and secondary coach. In 1983, Cope became head coach of Pacific and brought Carroll on as assistant head coach and offensive coordinator. Carroll left Pacific after a year and entered the NFL in 1984 as the defensive backs coach of the Buffalo Bills. The next year, he moved onto the Minnesota Vikings where he held a similar position for five seasons (1985–89). In 1989, he was a candidate for the head coaching position at Stanford University; the position went to Dennis Green.J A. Adande, Rah-Rah Material, Los Angeles Times, November 9, 2002. Retrieved January 16, 2009. His success with the Vikings led to his hiring by the New York Jets, where he served as defensive coordinator under Bruce Coslet for four seasons (1990–93). When there was an opening for the Vikings' head coach position in 1992, he was a serious candidate but lost the position, again to Green. In 1994, Carroll was elevated to head coach of the Jets. Known for energy and youthful enthusiasm, Carroll painted a basketball court in the parking lot of the team's practice facility where he and his assistant coaches regularly played three-on-three games during their spare time.Sam Farmer, Spirit of Carroll Also Haunting Him, Los Angeles Times, December 16, 2000.

The Jets got off to a 6–5 start under Carroll, but in week 12, he was the victim of Dan Marino's "clock play"—a fake spike that became a Miami Dolphins game-winning touchdown. The Jets lost all of their remaining games to finish 6–10. He was fired after one season.See also Eskenazi, Gerald (1998) – GANG GREEN: An Irreverent Look Behind The Scenes At Thirty-Eight (well, Thirty-Seven) Seasons Of New York Jets Football Futility (New York: Simon & Schuster) Carroll was hired for the next season by the San Francisco 49ers, where he served as defensive coordinator for the following two seasons (1995–96). His return to success as the defensive coordinator led to his hiring as the head coach of the New England Patriots in 1997, replacing coach Bill Parcells, who had resigned after disputes with the team's ownership. His 1997 Patriots team won the AFC East division title, but his subsequent two teams did not fare as well—losing in the wild card playoff round in 1998, and missing the playoffs after a late-season slide in 1999—and he was fired after the 1999 season. Patriots owner Robert Kraft said firing Carroll was one of the toughest decisions he has had to make since buying the team, stating, "A lot of things were going on that made it difficult for him to stay, some of which were out of his control. And it began with following a legend." His combined NFL record as a head coach was 33–31, and he was later considered a much better fit for college football than the NFL after his success at USC.NFL Top 10 – Coaches who belonged in college Even though several NFL teams approached him with defensive coordinator positions, Carroll instead spent the 2000 season as a consultant for pro and college teams, doing charitable work for the NFL, and writing a column about pro football for CNNSI.com.Profile: Pete Carroll, USC Athletic Department.

USC first pursued then Oregon State coach Dennis Erickson, who instead signed a contract extension with the Beavers; then Oregon coach Mike Bellotti, who similarly signed an extension. The search then moved to the San Diego Chargers coach Mike Riley, who had been an assistant coach at USC before later becoming the head coach of Oregon State. Stuck in contractual obligations to the Chargers (who were still in the midst of an NFL season) and hesitating about moving his family, Riley was unable to give a firm answer, opening an opportunity for Carroll, the school's fourth choice. Carroll actively pursued the position, as his daughter, Jaime, was then a player on the school's successful volleyball team. After the first three primary candidates turned down the position, USC hired Carroll. Under Garrett, USC had tried to recruit Carroll to be their head coach in 1997, while he was coaching the Patriots, but Carroll was unable to take the position. The second time the opening came up, Daryl Gross, then senior associate athletic director for USC, recommended Carroll to Garrett based on his experience as a former scout for the New York Jets while Carroll coached there.Bill Plaschke, Sorry, Pete, We Were Wrong, Los Angeles Times, December 30, 2003.

On June 9, 2010, The Los Angeles Times reported that Carroll, along with other active and former USC officials, had appeared in front of a ten-member NCAA Committee on Infractions the previous February. The next day, June 10, the NCAA announced sanctions against the USC football program including a two-year bowl ban, the elimination of thirty football scholarships, and forfeiture of some football victories from 2004–05 (a season which had included winning the Bowl Championship Series title), and all team victories from the undefeated 2005–06 regular season, when USC lost to Texas in the BCS title game. With the vacated games removed, Carroll drops to fourth on USC's all-time wins list, behind John McKay, Howard Jones and John Robinson. His 97 on-field wins would put him ahead of Robinson for third in Trojan history. The allegations centered on former Trojan star Reggie Bush. Bush was found to have accepted several improper gifts, including the use of a San Diego area home for members of his family. It was reported that USC might appeal the sanctions.

He said in 2014 during a visit to USC, "I thought (the NCAA's investigation into USC) was dealt with poorly and very irrationally and done with way too much emotion instead of facts.

On August 26, 2010, the Football Writers Association of America announced it would take back USC's 2004 Grantland Rice Trophy and leave that year's award vacant, the only vacancy in the over half century of the history of the award. The FWAA also said it would not consider USC as a candidate for the award for the 2010 season. New USC athletic director Pat Haden said USC would return the trophy, stating "While we know that some fans and former student-athletes may be disappointed, our central priority at this time is our overall commitment to compliance and this action is in line with the standards we have set for our entire athletic program." After the Seattle Seahawks fired head coach Jim L. Mora after one season, Carroll was rumored to be in the running for the job. On January 8, 2010, it was reported that Carroll was about to be hired as head coach of the Seahawks; the two parties were hammering out "minor details" in the pending contract. According to the Los Angeles Times, Carroll was "close to reaching an agreement with the Seattle Seahawks on Friday evening". On the morning of January 9, 2010, Carroll reportedly came to agreement with the Seahawks on a 5-year contract that would appoint him as head coach. He was officially hired as the Seahawks head coach on January 11.  He was also named executive vice president of football operations, effectively making him the Seahawks' general manager as well.  While the Seahawks have a general manager in John Schneider, he serves mainly in an advisory role to Carroll, who has the final say in football matters.  In fact, Schneider was actually hired by Carroll—a rare case of the head coach hiring the general manager.  He is one of two current NFL coaches who also have the title or powers of general manager with the other being Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots. In his first season, Carroll almost completely overturned the Seahawks roster, totaling over 200 transactions in the course of only one season. However, these moves paved the way for a 4–2 start to the 2010 season. Although Seattle faltered through the latter half of the season, the team beat the division rival Rams in the final week of the regular season for the NFC West championship, becoming the first 7–9 team in NFL history to win a division title. Carroll made even more history as the Seahawks later upset the then-Super Bowl Champions New Orleans Saints during the wild card round of the playoffs, behind Marshawn Lynch and the famed Beast Quake. However, they then fell to the Chicago Bears, whom they had defeated earlier in the season. In 2011, Carroll again coached the Seahawks to a 7-9 record, but it was not enough to secure a playoff spot due to the ascendance of Carroll's old college rival coach Jim Harbaugh and division rival San Francisco 49ers. In his third season in 2012, Carroll, along with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson, led the team to an 11-5 record, including going undefeated at home. It was Carroll's first winning season for the team. The Seahawks were also involved in controversy during Week 3's Monday Night Football game against the Green Bay Packers in Seattle, when the replacement officials called two different results for Russell Wilson's hail mary pass to Golden Tate. The officials called the play in the Seahawks' favor, igniting a national outrage about the officiating. When the NFL referee lockout ended several days later, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged that public furor over the call accelerated the eventual resolution of the labor dispute. Carroll's record was enough to post the team's second playoff berth, and the Seahawks won their wildcard round playoff game on the road against the Washington Redskins, 24-14. Seattle lost the following week in the divisional round to the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 30-28. Carroll's fourth season, 2013, was his greatest level of success in the professional league. His Seahawks finished the regular season with a sterling 13-3 record, placing them on top of the NFC conference for their first time since 2005. The Seahawks produced an identical record to the '05 team, excelled through the playoffs, and into the Super Bowl for the second time in franchise history. The previous year, even explicitly marked with a divisional-round loss, confirmed to the league that they were viable contenders. Carroll's improvements had finally become conspicuous; and Seattle believed, righteously, that its agonizing two-point loss to the Falcons would be avenged.  The Seattle Seahawks 2013 season began with four consecutive preseason wins, and they had been distinguished, by odds-makers, as the conference favorite. The regular season began with a victory at Carolina. The prior year's NFC Champions, and divisional rival, the San Francisco 49ers, were blown out by the Seahawks, 29–3. Winning out September, they visited the Colts in Indianapolis, and suffered their first loss, on October 6. That was the only loss Carroll, and team, would suffer until December. Heading to San Francisco for their second match-up against their divisional foe, the Seahawks were consensus best in NFC, posting an 11–1 record. However, the game was in stark contrast to their first in September. The 49ers edged out a 19–17 win, yet the Seahawks' then 11–2 record was still best in the conference. The penultimate game, against the Arizona Cardinals, was Seattle's attempt to continue their at-home winning streak to 15 games (record started in Week 2 of 2012 season). Although the Seahawks had won their three prior meetings, including one earlier in the year, the Cardinals had steadily improved during the season. The at-home win streak did not reach 15. The Cardinals won, and Seattle suffered its third loss of the year. Their regular-season finale, against the St. Louis Rams, established a new at-home streak of one, and Carroll concluded the regular season at 13–3. The number one team (and playoff seed) in the NFC, Carroll matched Mike Holmgren's 2005 season of the same record, tying for the best in Seattle history. The Seahawks defeated the Saints in the divisional round of the playoffs. In the NFC Championship Game, Richard Sherman tipped a Colin Kaepernick pass into the waiting arms of Malcolm Smith to secure a 23-17 win over the 49ers.  On February 2, 2014, Carroll led the Seattle Seahawks to their first Super Bowl win in franchise history after defeating the Denver Broncos, 43–8, in Super Bowl XLVIII. Carroll joined Barry Switzer and Jimmy Johnson as the only coaches to win both an NCAA championship and a Super Bowl. At age 62, Carroll was the third-oldest coach to win a Super Bowl. Tom Coughlin was 65 when his Giants won Super Bowl XLVI.  Dick Vermeil was 63 when the St. Louis Rams won Super Bowl XXXIV. The following season, the Seahawks started off their quest to repeat as champions with a 36-16 defeat of the Green Bay Packers in the first game of the NFL season. A Super Bowl XLVIII rematch came in Week 3, with Seattle again defeating Peyton Manning and the Broncos, 26-20 in overtime. However, losses to San Diego, Dallas, St Louis, and Kansas City caused the defending champions to start the season 6-4, three games behind the division leading Cardinals. After a team meeting following a Week 11 loss, the Seahawks finished the regular season 6-0 to finish with a 12-4 record. The #1 seed in the playoffs, the Seahawks beat the Panthers in the divisional round, 31-17, to get to their 2nd straight NFC Championship. After trailing 19-7 to the Packers with just over two minutes remaining in the NFC Championship, the Seahawks launched a furious comeback to force OT. On the first possession of overtime, Russell Wilson hit Jermaine Kearse for a game-winning touchdown that sent the Seahawks to their second straight Super Bowl. On February 1, 2015, Carroll's Seahawks lost Super Bowl XLIX to New England Patriots, 28–24.  With 25 seconds to go on second down and goal at the Patriots' 1 yard line, and the Seahawks trailing by 4, Carroll called for a pass play. Wilson's pass was intercepted by Patriots' cornerback Malcolm Butler on the goal line, and the Patriots ran out the clock. The 2015 offseason was one full of criticism for Carroll, Wilson, and offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell after the Super Bowl ending. Carroll was praised by much of the national media for how he handled the adversity following the game. The Seahawks began the 2015 season by blowing 4th quarter leads to St Louis, Green Bay, Cincinnati, Carolina, and Arizona. After losing at home on Sunday Night Football to the division leading Cardinals, Seattle sat at 4-5. However, Carroll rejuvenated his team enough to win their next 5 games, putting the Seahawks at 9-5 and clinching a playoff berth. Russell Wilson became the first quarterback to throw 19 or more touchdown passes without any interceptions over 5 or more wins. The Seahawks ended the regular season with a revengeful win against Arizona, beating the NFC West champions 36-6 on the road. Seattle entered the postseason as the #6 seed, winning its Wild Card matchup against the Minnesota Vikings after Vikings kicker Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal for a final score of 10-9. The Seahawks would later fall to the Carolina Panthers in the divisional round 31-24.

Carroll draws coaching inspiration from the 1974 book The Inner Game of Tennis, by tennis coach W. Timothy Gallwey, which he picked up as graduate student at the University of the Pacific; he summarizes the philosophy he took from the book as "all about clearing the clutter in the interactions between your conscious and subconscious mind" enabled "through superior practice and a clear approach. Focus, clarity and belief in yourself are what allows  you to express your ability without discursive thoughts and concerns."Kurt Streeter, Carroll goes by the book to teach football at USC, Los Angeles Times, August 26, 2007.

He also cites influences from psychologists Abraham Maslow and Carl Jung, Buddhist meditation master Chögyam Trungpa and Zen master D. T. Suzuki. After he was fired by the New England Patriots, Carroll read a book by former UCLA basketball coach John Wooden which heavily influenced how he would run his future program at USC: emulating Wooden, Carroll decided to engineer his program in the way that best exemplified his personal philosophy. He decided his philosophy was best summarized as "I'm a competitor". As a fan of the Grateful Dead, Carroll then tied Wooden's thoughts into those by Jerry Garcia, and decided that he wanted his football program to not be the best, but the only program following his competitive philosophy. Carroll is known for his high-energy and often pleasant demeanor when coaching.Doug Krikorian, Commentary: Trojans feed off Carroll's charisma, Daily Breeze, August 21, 2007.J. R.

Carroll favorably compared college recruiting to any other competition, and enjoys the ability to recruit talent, which he was unable to do in the NFL. He likens being a college head coach to being both the "coach and general manager. He assigned all jersey numbers to his players, an assignment he takes seriously. When he was an incoming freshman at Pacific, he wanted No. 40, the number he had worn in all sports growing up; however, Pacific had retired the number in honor of quarterback/safety Eddie LeBaron, so Carroll ended up with 46.Ben Malcolmson, A numbers game, USCRipsIt/PeteCarroll.com, August 12, 2008.

Jerry Garcia said that he didn't want his band to be the best ones doing something. He wanted them to be the only ones doing it. To be all by yourself out there doing something that nobody else can touch — that's the thought that guides me, that guides this program: We're going to do things better than it's ever been done before in everything we do, and we're going to compete our ass off. And we're gonna see how far that takes us." — Carroll on how John Wooden and Jerry Garcia influenced his coaching philosophy.
