 The Lockheed C-5 Galaxy is a large military transport aircraft originally designed and built by Lockheed, and now maintained and upgraded by its successor, Lockheed Martin. It provides the United States Air Force (USAF) with a heavy intercontinental-range strategic airlift capability, one that can carry outsize and oversize loads, including all air-certifiable cargo. The Galaxy has many similarities to its smaller Lockheed C-141 Starlifter predecessor, and the later Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. The C-5 is among the largest military aircraft in the world. The C-5 Galaxy's development was complicated, including significant cost overruns, and Lockheed suffered significant financial difficulties. Shortly after entering service, cracks in the wings of many aircraft were discovered and the C-5 fleet was restricted in capability until corrective work was completed. The C-5M Super Galaxy is an upgraded version with new engines and modernized avionics designed to extend its service life beyond 2040. The USAF has operated the C-5 since 1969. In that time, the airlifter supported US military operations in all major conflicts including Vietnam, Iraq, Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, as well as allied support, such as Israel during the Yom Kippur War and operations in the Gulf War. The Galaxy has also been used to distribute humanitarian aid and disaster relief, and supported the US Space Shuttle program. In 1961, several aircraft companies began studying heavy jet transport designs that would replace the Douglas C-133 Cargomaster and complement Lockheed C-141 Starlifters. In addition to higher overall performance, the United States Army wanted a transport aircraft with a larger cargo bay than the C-141, whose interior was too small to carry a variety of their outsized equipment. These studies led to the "CX-4" design concept, but in 1962 the proposed six-engine design was rejected, because it was not viewed as a significant advance over the C-141. By late 1963, the next conceptual design was named CX-X. It was equipped with four engines, instead of six engines in the earlier CX-4 concept. The CX-X had a gross weight of , a maximum payload of  and a speed of Mach&nbsp;0.75 (). The cargo compartment was  wide by  high and  long with front and rear access doors."C-5 history." GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved 20 January 2010. To meet the power and range specifications with only four engines required a new engine with dramatically improved fuel efficiency. The criteria were finalized and an official request for proposal was issued in April 1964 for the "Heavy Logistics System" (CX-HLS) (previously CX-X). In May 1964, proposals for aircraft were received from Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, and Martin Marietta. General Electric, Curtiss-Wright, and Pratt & Whitney submitted proposals for the engines. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed were given one-year study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines.Norton 2003, pp. 8–9. All three of the designs shared a number of features. The cockpit was placed well above the cargo area to allow for cargo loading through a nose door. The Boeing and Douglas designs used a pod on the top of the fuselage containing the cockpit, while the Lockheed design extended the cockpit profile down the length of the fuselage, giving it an egg-shaped cross section. All of the designs had swept wings, as well as front and rear cargo doors allowing simultaneous loading and unloading. Lockheed's design featured a T-tail, while the designs by Boeing and Douglas had conventional tails.Norton 2003, pp. 12–13. The Air Force considered Boeing's design to be better than that of Lockheed, but Lockheed's proposal was the lowest total cost bid.Norton 2003, p. 11. Lockheed was selected the winner in September 1965, then awarded a contract in December 1965.Erving 1993, pp. 189–190. General Electric's TF39 engine was selected in August 1965 to power the new transport plane. At the time GE's engine concept was revolutionary, as all engines beforehand had a bypass ratio of less than two-to-one, while the TF39 promised and would achieve a ratio of eight-to-one, which had the benefits of increased engine thrust and lower fuel consumption.Bakse 1995, pp. 39, 74.Phillips 2004, p. 127. The first C-5A Galaxy (serial number 66-8303) was rolled out of the manufacturing plant in Marietta, Georgia, on 2 March 1968.Veronico and Dunn 2004, p. 62. On 30 June 1968, flight testing of the C-5A began with the first flight, flown by Leo Sullivan, with the call sign "eight-three-oh-three heavy". Flight tests revealed that the aircraft exhibited a higher drag divergence Mach number than predicted by wind tunnel data. The maximum lift coefficient measured in flight with the flaps deflected 40-degree was higher than predicted (2.60 vs. 2.38), but was lower than predicted with the flaps deflected 25 degrees (2.31 vs. 2.38) and with the flaps retracted (1.45 vs. 1.52).Garrard, Wilfred C. "The Lockheed C-5 Case Study in Aircraft Design". AIAA Professional Study Series. Aircraft weight was a serious issue during design and development. At the time of the first flight, the weight was below the guaranteed weight, but by the time of the delivery of the 9th aircraft, had exceeded guarantees. In July 1969, during a fuselage upbending test, the wing failed at 128% of limit load, which is below the requirement that it sustain 150% of limit load. Changes were made to the wing, but during a test in July 1970, it failed at 125% of limit load. A passive load reduction system, involving uprigged ailerons was incorporated, but the maximum allowable payload was reduced from 220,000&nbsp;pounds to 190,000&nbsp;pounds. At the time, it was predicted that there was a 90% probability that no more than 10% of the fleet of 79 airframes would reach their fatigue life of 19,000 hours without cracking of the wing. Cost overruns and technical problems of the C-5A were the subject of a congressional investigation in 1968 and 1969."Plane costs suppressed, Colonel says." Milwaukee Journal, 30 April 1969."C-5A Foe says Pentagon stripped him of duties." The New York Times, 18 November 1969. The C-5 program has the dubious distinction of being the first development program with a one billion dollar overrun.Garwood, Darrell. "Newest Air Force planes grounded." Times-News, 17 January 1970. Due to the C-5's troubled development, the Department of Defense abandoned Total Package Procurement.Nalty 2003, pp. 192–193. In 1969 Henry Durham raised concerns about the C-5 production process with Lockheed, his employer. Subsequently, Durham was transferred and subjected to abuse until he resigned. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) substantiated some of his charges against Lockheed. Later, the American Ethical Union honored Durham with the Elliott-Black Award."A Whistle-blower on the C-5A Gets a New Life." People Magazine, 15 July 1974. Upon completion of testing in December 1969, the first C-5A was transferred to the Transitional Training Unit at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Lockheed delivered the first operational Galaxy to the 437th Airlift Wing, Charleston Air Force Base, SC, in June 1970. Due to higher than expected development costs, in 1970 there were public calls for the government to split the substantial losses that Lockheed was experiencing."General asks U.S. to share Lockheed loss." Spokane Daily Chronicle, 29 June 1970. Production was nearly brought to a halt in 1971 due to Lockheed going through financial difficulties, due in part to the C-5 Galaxy's development as well as a civilian jet liner, the Lockheed L-1011."New Life for TriStar." Time, 17 May 1971. Retrieved 6 January 2007. The U.S. government gave loans to Lockheed to keep the company operational.Aspin, Les. "The Lockheed Loan revisited." The New York Times, 29 August 1972. In the early 1970s, NASA considered the C-5 for the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft role, to transport the Space Shuttle to Kennedy Space Center. However, they rejected it in favor of the Boeing 747, in part due to the 747's low-wing design.Miles, Marvin. "Jumbo Jet will ferry Space Shuttle Piggyback across U.S."  Los Angeles Times, 19 June 1974. In contrast, the Soviet Union chose to transport its shuttles using the high-winged An-225,Goebel, Greg.

Retrieved 18 June 2006. which derives from the An-124, which is similar in design and function to the C-5. During static and fatigue testing cracks were noticed in the wings of several aircraft, and as a consequence the C-5A fleet was restricted to 80% of maximum design loads. To reduce wing loading, load alleviation systems were added to the aircraft.Norton 2003, pp. 31–36. By 1980, payloads were restricted to as low as  for general cargo during peacetime operations. A $1.5 billion program, known as H-Mod,National Research Council 1997, p. 90. to re-wing the 76 completed C-5As to restore full payload capability and service life began in 1976.Finney, John W.

"Disputed C-5 jet gets Pentagon nod."  Chicago Tribune, 21 January 1982. After design and testing of the new wing design, the C-5As received their new wings from 1980 to 1987.Norton 2003, pp. 53–56. During 1976, numerous cracks were also found in the fuselage along the upper fuselage on the centerline, aft of the refueling port, extending back to the wing. The cracks required a redesign to the hydraulic system for the visor, the front cargo entry point. In 1974, Iran, then holding good relations with the United States, offered $160 million to restart C-5 production to enable Iran to purchase aircraft for their own air force,"Iran may fund new production of Lockheed C-5." Los Angeles Times, 8 May 1974.Wright, Robert A. "Lockheed considers Textron merger; Profitable division Iranian offer is reported." The New York Times, 8 May 1974. in a similar climate as to their acquisition of F-14 Tomcat fighters.Marder, Murray. "Oil pact with U.S. firm: Iran signs agreement." Victoria Advocate, 26 July 1973. However no C-5 aircraft were ever ordered by Iran, as the prospect was firmly halted by the Iranian Revolution in 1979."Vital US military technology has been lost to new Iranian regime." Lewiston Evening Journal, 16 February 1979."U.S. cuts off plane parts to Iran." Chicago Tribune, 9 November 1979. As part of President Ronald Reagan's military policy, funding was made available for expansion of the USAF's airlift capability.  With the C-17 program still some years from completion, Congress approved funding for a new version of the C-5, the C-5B, in July 1982 to expand airlift capacity.Storer, Rowley. "House gives Reagan victories on MX, C-5." Chicago Tribune, 22 July 1982."U.S. Air Force wants to double Airlift capacity."  Times Daily, 27 January 1982.Nalty 2003, p. 367. The first C-5B was delivered to Altus Air Force Base in January 1986. In April 1989, the last of 50 C-5B aircraft was added to the 77 C-5As in the Air Force's airlift force structure. The C-5B includes all C-5A improvements and numerous additional system modifications to improve reliability and maintainability.Norton 2003, pp. 56–58. In 1998, the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) began upgrading the C-5's avionics to include a glass cockpit, navigation equipment, and a new autopilot system.Schanz, Marc V., Assoc. Editor. "Life with the C-5." Air Force Magazine, Volume 90, Issue 6, June 2007, pp. 59–60. .  Another part of the C-5 modernization effort is the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP). The program will mainly replace the engines with newer, more powerful ones.Tirpak, John A.  "Saving the Galaxy." Air Force Magazine, January 2004. A total of 52 C-5s are contracted to be modernized, consisting of 49 B-, two C- and one A-model aircraft through the Reliability Enhancement and Re-Engining Program (RERP). The program features over 70 changes and upgrades, including the newer General Electric engines."Lockheed Martin Delivers Second Production C-5M Super Galaxy To U.S. Air Force" Lockheed Martin Press Release, 12 April 2011.Trimble, Stephen. "Lockheed Martin inducts first C-5B for C-5M modifications." Flight International, 21 August 2009.  Three C-5s underwent RERP for testing purposes.

Archived on 26 September 2014 The C-5 is a large high-wing cargo aircraft with a distinctive high T-tail fin (vertical) stabilizer, and with four TF39 turbofan engines mounted on pylons beneath wings that are swept 25 degrees. Similar in layout to its smaller predecessor, the C-141 Starlifter, the C-5 has 12 internal wing tanks and is equipped for aerial refueling. Above the plane-length cargo deck, it provides an upper deck for flight operations and for seating 75 passengers including the embarked loadmaster crew, all who face to the rear of the aircraft during flight. Full-open(able) bay doors at both nose and tail enable "drive-through" loading and unloading of cargo."C-5 design."  Globalsecurity.org, 20 January 2010. The cargo hold of the C-5 is one foot longer than the entire length of the first powered flight by the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk."The Five First Flights." thewrightbrothers.org, 23 July 2008. For its voracious consumption of fuel and its maintenance and reliability issues the Galaxy's aircrews have nicknamed it FRED, for: fucking ridiculous, economic/environmental disaster.Lippincott 2006, p. 4. Takeoff and landing distance requirements for the plane at maximum-load gross weight are  and , respectively. Its high flotation main landing gear provides 28 wheels to distribute gross weight on paved or earth surfaces. The rear main landing gear can be steered to make a smaller turning radius, and rotates 90 degrees after takeoff before being retracted. "Kneeling" landing gear permits lowering the aircraft when parked, thereby presenting the cargo deck at truck-bed height to facilitate loading and unloading operations.Air International February 1984, p. 63. The C-5 features a Malfunction Detection Analysis and Recording (MADAR) system to identify errors throughout the aircraft. The cargo compartment is  long,  high, and  wide, or just over . It can accommodate up to 36 463L master pallets or a mix of palletized cargo and vehicles. The nose and aft cargo-bay doors open the full width and height of the cargo bay to maximize efficient loading of oversized equipment. Full width ramps enable loading double rows of vehicles from either end of the cargo hold. The Galaxy C-5 is capable of moving nearly every type of military combat equipment, including such bulky items as the Army armored vehicle launched bridge (AVLB), at  , from the United States to any location on the globe; and of accommodating up to six Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters or five Bradley Fighting Vehicles at one time.Congressional Budget Office 1986, p. 46. The first C-5A was delivered to the USAF on 17 December 1969. Wings were built up in the early 1970s at Altus AFB, Oklahoma; Charleston AFB, South Carolina; Dover AFB, Delaware; and Travis AFB, California. The C-5's first mission was on 9 July 1970, in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.Coughlin, William J. "C-5A in first S. Viet flight." Los Angeles Times, 10 July 1970. C-5s were used to transport equipment and troops, including Army tanks and even some small aircraft, throughout the later years of the US action in Vietnam.Norton 2003, pp. 43–44. In the final weeks of the war, prior to the Fall of Saigon, several C-5s were involved in evacuation efforts. During one such mission a C-5A crashed while transporting a large number of orphans, with over 140 killed. C-5s have also been used to deliver support and reinforce various US allies over the years. During the Yom Kippur war in 1973, multiple C-5s and C-141 Starlifters delivered critical supplies of ammunition, replacement weaponry and other forms of aid to Israel, the US effort was named as Operation Nickel Grass.Norton 2003, pp. 45–46.Dunstan 2007, pp. 56, 88. The C-5 Galaxy's performance in Israel was such that the Pentagon began to consider further purchases."C-5 Performance in Israel may spur Pentagon to order more." Los Angeles Times, 9 November 1973. The C-5 was regularly made available to support American allies, such as the British-led peacekeeper initiative in Zimbabwe in 1979."U.S. Cargo Jets to play Zimbabwe role." Los Angeles Times, 7 December 1979, On 24 October 1974, the Space and Missile Systems Organization successfully conducted an Air Mobile Feasibility Test where a C-5A Galaxy aircraft air dropped an 86,000&nbsp;lb Minuteman ICBM from 20,000&nbsp;ft over the Pacific Ocean. The missile descended to 8,000&nbsp;ft before its rocket engine fired. The 10-second engine burn carried the missile to 20,000&nbsp;ft again before it dropped into the ocean. The test proved the feasibility of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile from the air.

There have been at least two other C-5 crashes that resulted in major airframe damage, but the aircraft were repaired and returned to service. C-5A, AF Ser. No. 69-0014, is on display at the Air Mobility Command Museum at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. This is the first, and currently only, C-5 aircraft to go on museum display.C-5 goes on display at AMC museum airforcetimes.comhttp://amcmuseum.org/at-the-museum/aircraft/c-5a-galaxy/        60th Military Airlift Wing/Air Mobility Wing - Travis Air Force Base, California 436th Military Airlift Wing/Airlift Wing - Dover Air Force Base, Delaware 437th Military Airlift Wing - Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina 443d Military Airlift Wing - Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma 97th Air Mobility Wing - Altus AFB, Oklahoma 349th Military Airlift Wing/Air Mobility Wing(Associate) - Travis Air Force Base, California 433d Military Airlift Wing/Airlift Wing - Kelly/Lackland Air Force Base, Texas 439th Military Airlift Wing/Airlift Wing - Westover Air Reserve Base, Massachusetts 445th Airlift Wing - Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 512th Military Airlift Wing/Airlift Wing(Associate) - Dover Air Force Base, Delaware 105th Military Airlift Group/Military Airlift Wing/Airlift Wing - Stewart ANGB, New York 164th Military Airlift Wing/Airlift Wing - Memphis, Tennessee 167th Airlift Wing - Martinsburg, West Virginia On 27 May 1970, C-5A AF serial number 67-0172 was destroyed during a ground fire at Palmdale, California after an Air Turbine Motor (ATM) started backwards and quickly overheated, setting the hydraulic system on fire and consuming the aircraft. The engines were not running at the time of the fire. Five crew escaped, and seven firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the blaze.San Bernardino Sun, 28 May 1970."C-5 crash doesn’t diminish historian’s view of aircraft."  US Air Force, 4 April 2006. On 17 October 1970, C-5A AF Ser. No. 66-8303 was destroyed during a ground fire at the Lockheed Aircraft plant at Dobbins AFB in Marietta, Georgia. The fire started during maintenance in one of the aircraft's 12 fuel cells. One worker was killed and another injured. This was the first C-5 aircraft produced. On 27 September 1974, C-5A 68-0227 crashed after over-running the runway at Clinton, Oklahoma Municipal Airport during an emergency landing following a serious landing gear fire. The crew mistakenly aligned the aircraft for the visual approach into the wrong airport, landing at Clinton Municipal Airport, which has a  runway—instead of the airfield at Clinton-Sherman Industrial Airpark (former Clinton-Sherman AFB), which has a  runway. This was the first operational loss of a C-5 Galaxy. On 4 April 1975, C-5A 68-0218 crashed while carrying orphans out of Vietnam during Operation Babylift.  This crash is one of the most notorious C-5 accidents to date."Portrait of tragedy." Evening Independent, 4 April 1975.  The crash occurred while trying to make an emergency landing at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Saigon, following a rear pressure door lock failure in flight."305 aboard giant craft; 100 survive." Boca Raton News, 4 April 1975. 144 people (including 78 children) were killed out of the 313 aboard (243 children, 44 escorts, 16 flight crew and 10 medical crew).http://babyliftrevisited.typepad.com/babylift_revisited/2006/07/the_crew_of_the.html Use of the C-5 was heavily restricted for several months following this high profile accident."Airforce imposes curbs on C-5 use." The New York Times, 12 April 1975. On 31 July 1983, C-5A 70-0446 crashed on landing at Shemya, Alaska. The C-5 approached below the glide slope, hit an embankment short of the runway and bounced back into the air before coming to rest on the runway. Structural damage was extensive and the two aft main landing gear bogies were sheared from the aircraft. There were no fatalities. A joint USAF/Lockheed team made repairs enabling a one-time ferry flight from Shemya to the Lockheed plant in Marietta, Georgia. There, the aircraft was quickly christened Phoenix II and permanent repair efforts got under way. In addition to the structural repairs, Phoenix II also received an improved landing gear system (common to the then-new C-5B), wing modification, and a color weather radar upgrade. The aircraft was returned to service.Lippincott 2006, p. 35. In July 1985, C-5A 68-0216 landed gear up at Travis Air Force Base, California. There were no injuries. The accident occurred while the crew was performing touch-and-go landings, and did not lower the landing gear during the final approach of the day. The aircraft received significant damage to the lower fuselage and main landing gear pods. The C-5A was later flown to Marietta for repairs. While there, the aircraft was selected to be the first C-5A converted to the C-5C configuration.Lippincott 2006, p. 28. On 29 August 1990, C-5A 68-0228 crashed following an engine failure shortly after take-off. The aircraft took off from Ramstein Air Base in Germany in support of Operation Desert Shield. It was flown by a nine-member reserve crew from the 68th Airlift Squadron, 433rd Airlift Wing based at Kelly AFB, Texas."San Antonio air base mourns reservists killed in C-5 crash." Austin American-Statesman, 30 August 1990. As the aircraft started to climb off the runway, one of the thrust reversers suddenly deployed. This resulted in loss of control of the aircraft and the subsequent crash. Of the 17 people on board, only four survived the crash."U.S. plane crashes, killing 13." Deseret News, 29 August 1990. All four were in the rear troop compartment. The sole crew member to survive, Staff Sgt. Lorenzo Galvan, Jr., was awarded the Airman's Medal for his actions in evacuating the survivors from the wreckage. On 3 April 2006, C-5B 84-0059 crashed following a cockpit indication that a thrust reverser was not locked. The C-5B assigned to the 436th Airlift Wing and flown by a reserve crew from the 709th Airlift Squadron, 512th Airlift Wing crashed about  short of the runway while attempting a heavyweight emergency landing at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. The aircraft had taken off from Dover 21 minutes earlier and reported an in-flight emergency 10 minutes into the flight. All 17 people aboard survived, but two received serious injuries. The Air Force's accident investigation board report concluded the cause to be human error, most notably the crew had been manipulating the throttle of the (dead) number two engine as if it was still running while keeping the (live) number three engine at idle. The situation was further worsened by the crew's decision to use a high flap setting that increased drag beyond normal two engine capabilities."C-5 accident investigation board complete." US Air Force, 13 June 2006."USAF Crash Investigation Video." youtube.com.  The aircraft was one of the first to receive the new avionics and glass flight displays for C-5 avionics modernization program (AMP)."Air Force blames crew for C-5 crash" DelawareOnline, 14 June 2006.  This accident led to a redesign of the cockpit engine displays, particularly the visual indicators of a non-active engine."Pilot Performance Based Selection of Engine Display Features." Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, Vol. 54, no. 1, September 2010, pp. 65–69.  The aircraft was a complete hull-loss and the airframe scrapped, but the forward fuselage became a C-5 AMP test bed.Langley, Nicole. "Gone with the wings: C-5 removal process in full swing."
