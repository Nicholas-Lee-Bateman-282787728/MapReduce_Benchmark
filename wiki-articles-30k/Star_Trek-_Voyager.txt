    Star Trek: Voyager is a science fiction television series, set in the Star Trek universe. The show takes place during the 2370s, and begins on the far side of the Milky Way galaxy, 70,000 light-years from Earth. It follows the adventures of the Starfleet vesselUSS Voyager, which becomes stranded in the Delta Quadrant while searching for a renegade Maquis ship. Voyager has to make the estimated 75-year journey home. The show was created by Rick Berman, Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, and is the fifth incarnation of Star Trek, which began with the 1960s series Star Trek that was created by Gene Roddenberry. It was produced for seven seasons, from 1995 to 2001, and is the first Star Trek TV series with a female captain, Kathryn Janeway played by Kate Mulgrew, as a main character. Berman served as head executive producer in charge of the overall production for the series during its entire run. He was assisted by a second in command executive producer who generally functioned as the day to day showrunner. There were four throughout the series' run: Michael Piller (EP/showrunner – first and second season), Jeri Taylor (EP – first through fourth season, showrunner – third and fourth season), Brannon Braga (EP/showrunner – fifth and sixth season), and Kenneth Biller (EP/showrunner – seventh season). Star Trek: Voyager aired on UPN and was the network's second longest running series, as well as the final show from its debut lineup to end. As Star Trek: The Next Generation ended, Paramount Pictures wanted to continue to have a second Star Trek TV series to accompany Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The studio also planned to start a new television network, and wanted the new show to help it succeed. This was reminiscent of Paramount's earlier plans to launch its own network by showcasing Star Trek: Phase II in 1977. Initial work on Star Trek: Voyager started in 1993, and seeds for the show's backstory, including the development of the Maquis, were placed in several The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine episodes. Voyager was shot on the stages The Next Generation had used and the pilot, "Caretaker", was shot in September 1994. Around that time, Paramount was sold to Viacom, making Voyager the first Star Trek TV series to premiere after the sale concluded. Star Trek: Voyager was also the first Star Trek TV show to eliminate the use of models for exterior space shots and exclusively use computer-generated imagery (CGI) instead. seaQuest DSV and Babylon 5 had previously used CGI exclusively to avoid the huge expense of models, but the Star Trek television department continued using models because they felt models provided better realism. Amblin Imaging won an Emmy for the opening CGI title visuals, but the weekly episode exteriors were captured using hand-built miniatures of the Voyager, shuttlecraft, and other ships. That changed when Star Trek: Voyager went fully CGI for certain types of shots midway through Season 3 (late 1996). Foundation Imaging was the studio responsible for special effects during Babylon 5's first three seasons. Season 3's "The Swarm" was the first episode to use Foundation's effects exclusively. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine started using Foundation Imaging in conjunction with Digital Muse one year later (season 6). In its later seasons, Star Trek: Voyager featured visual effects from Foundation Imaging and Digital Muse.  In the pilot episode, "Caretaker",  departs station Deep Space Nine on a mission into the treacherous Badlands to find a missing ship piloted by a team of Maquis rebels, which the Vulcan Lt. Tuvok,Voyager's security officer, has secretly infiltrated. While in the Badlands, the Voyager is chased down and eventually enveloped by a powerful energy wave, which ends up damaging Voyager, killing several of its crew, and stranding the ship on the far side of the galaxy, known as the Delta Quadrant, more than 70,000 light-years from Earth. There, Voyager finds the Maquis ship, and eventually the two crews must reluctantly agree to join forces to survive their long journey home. Chakotay, leader of the Maquis group, becomes Voyager's first officer. B'Elanna Torres, a half-human/half-Klingon Maquis, becomes chief engineer. Tom Paris, whom Janeway released from a Federation prison to help her find the Maquis ship, is made Voyager's helm officer. Due to the deaths of the ship's entire medical staff, the Doctor, an Emergency Medical Hologram designed only for short-term use, is employed as the ship's doctor and Chief Medical Officer. Neelix, a Talaxian scavenger, and Kes, a young Ocampan, both natives of the Delta Quadrant, are welcomed aboard as the ship's chef/morale officer, and the Doctor's medical assistant respectively. Due to the great distance from Federation space, the Delta Quadrant is unexplored by Starfleet: Voyager truly is going where no human has gone before. As the ship sets out on its projected 75-year journey home, the crew passes through regions belonging to various species indigenous to the Delta Quadrant, such as the barbaric and belligerent Kazon; the organ-harvesting, disease-ravaged Vidiians; the nomadic hunter-race the Hirogen; the fearsome Species 8472 from fluidic space; and most notably the Borg, whose home is in the Delta Quadrant, so that Voyager has to move through large areas of Borg-controlled space in later seasons. They also encounter perilous natural phenomena such as a nebulous area called the Nekrit Expanse ("Fair Trade", third season), a large area of empty space called the Void ("Night", fifth season), wormholes, dangerous nebulae, and other anomalies. However, Voyager does not always deal with the unknown. It is the second Star Trek series to feature Q, an omnipotent alien, on a recurring basis (Q made only one appearance on Deep Space Nine). Also, Starfleet Command learns of Voyager's survival when the ship discovers an ancient interstellar communications network, claimed by the Hirogen, that the crew can tap into. This relay network is later disabled, but thanks to the efforts of [[Reginald Barclay]] (who was featured more prominently on ''The Next Generation''), Starfleet eventually establishes regular contact with ''Voyager'' by using a communications array and micro-wormhole technology. This ability to communicate figures prominently in the series' later years.  In the show's fourth season, Kes is replaced on the ship by [[Seven of Nine]] (known colloquially as Seven), a [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] drone who was assimilated as a six-year-old human girl but liberated from the collective by the ''Voyager'' crew. Seven begins to regain her humanity as the series progresses, thanks to ongoing efforts by Captain Janeway to show her that the perfection the Borg seek is not compatible with the imperfection of humanity; however, emotions such as love and caring are more important to happiness. The Doctor also becomes more human-like, thanks in part to a mobile holo-emitter the crew obtains in the third season which allows The Doctor to leave the confines of sickbay and roam the ship freely. He starts to discover his love for music and art, which he demonstrates in the episode [[Virtuoso (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Virtuoso"]]. In the sixth season, the crew discovers a group of adolescent aliens assimilated by the Borg but prematurely released from their maturation chambers due to a malfunction on their Borg cube. As he did with Seven of Nine, The Doctor re-humanizes the children; [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Voyager#Azan|Azan, Rebi and Mezoti]], three of them eventually find a new adoptive home while the fourth, [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Voyager#Icheb|Icheb]], chooses to stay aboard ''Voyager.''  Life for the ''Voyager'' crew continues to change during their long journey. Traitors [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Voyager#Seska|Seska]] and [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Voyager#Jonas|Michael Jonas]] are uncovered in the early months ([[State of Flux (Star Trek: Voyager)|"State of Flux"]]); loyal crew members are lost late in the journey; and other wayward Starfleet officers are integrated into the crew. During the second season, the first child is born aboard the ship to Ensign Samantha Wildman; as she grows up, Naomi Wildman becomes great friends with her godfather, Neelix. Early in the seventh season, Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres marry after a long courtship, and Torres gives birth to their child, [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Voyager#Miral|Miral Paris]], in the series finale. Late in the seventh season, the ship finds a colony of [[Talaxians]] on a makeshift settlement in an asteroid field; Neelix chooses to bid ''Voyager'' farewell and live once again among his people.  Over the course of the series, the crew of ''Voyager'' find a number of ways to shorten their journey by many decades, thanks to shortcuts in the episodes [[Night (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Night"]] and [[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Q2"]], technology boosts in episodes [[The Voyager Conspiracy (Star Trek: Voyager)|"The Voyager Conspiracy"]], "[[Dark Frontier]]", [[Timeless (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Timeless"]], and "[[Hope and Fear]]", subspace corridors in [[Dragon's Teeth (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Dragon's Teeth"]], and a mind-powered push from a powerful former shipmate in [[The Gift (Star Trek: Voyager)|"The Gift"]]. There are also other transportation and time travel opportunities that the crew are not able to use which appear in the episodes [[Prime Factors (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Prime Factors"]], "[[Future's End]]", [[Eye of the Needle (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Eye of the Needle"]], and [[Inside Man (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Inside Man"]]. All these efforts shorten their journey from 75 years to 23 years. However, one final effort involving time travel reduces the total duration to seven years, as shown in the series finale [[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Endgame"]].  ==Cast== {| class="wikitable" |- style="background:cornsilk" |style="text-align:center" colspan="7"|'''Main cast ''' |- style="background:#ccc" !

She reprised her role as the Borg Queen in the series' finale [[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Endgame"]] where she ends up being destroyed as well, due to a virus.  ==Connections with other ''Star Trek'' incarnations==  {{main|Star Trek Crossovers}}  ===Characters and races===  As with all other ''Star Trek'' series, the original ''Star Trek''<nowiki>'s Vulcans, Klingons and Romulans appear in Star Trek: Voyager. Voyager saw appearances by several other races who initially appear in The Next Generation: the Q, the Borg, Cardassians, Bajorans, Betazoids, and Ferengi, along with Deep Space Nine's Jem'Hadar (via hologram), as well as the Maquis resistance movement, previously established in episodes of The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. One notable connection between Voyager and The Next Generation appears regarding a wormhole and the Ferengi. In The Next Generation season 3 episode "The Price", bidding takes place for rights to a wormhole. The Ferengi send a delegation to the bidding. When the Enterprise and Ferengi vessel each send shuttles into the wormhole, they appear in the Delta Quadrant, where the Ferengi shuttle becomes trapped. In the Voyager season 3 episode "False Profits", the Ferengi who were trapped have since landed on a nearby planet, and begun exploiting the inhabitants for profit. Unlike The Next Generation, where composer Jerry Goldsmith's theme from Star Trek: The Motion Picture was reused, Goldsmith composed and conducted an entirely new main theme for Voyager. As done with The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine, a soundtrack album of the series' pilot episode "Caretaker" and a CD single containing three variations of the main theme were released by Crescendo Records in 1995 between seasons one and two.  A total of 26 numbered books were released during the series' original run from 1995 to 2001.  They include novelizations of the first episode, "Caretaker", "The Escape", "Violations", "Ragnarok", and novelizations of the episodes "Flashback", "Day of Honor", "Equinox" and "Endgame". There are also "unnumbered books", which are still part of the series, though not part of the official release. These novels consist of episode novelizations except for Caretaker, Mosaic (a biography of Kathryn Janeway), Pathways (a novel in which the biography of various crew members, including all of the senior staff is given); and The Nanotech War, a novel released in 2002, one year after the series' finale. A series of novels focusing on the continuing adventures of Voyager following the TV series finale was implemented in 2003, much as Pocket Books did with the Deep Space Nine relaunch novel series, which features stories placed after the finale of that show. In the relaunch, several characters are reassigned while others are promoted but stay aboard Voyager. These changes include Janeway's promotion to admiral, Chakotay becoming captain of Voyager, Tuvok leaving the ship to serve as Tactical Officer under William Riker, and Tom Paris' promotion to First Officer on the Voyager. The series also introduces several new characters. The series began with Homecoming and The Farther Shore in 2003, a direct sequel to the show's finale, "Endgame". These were followed in 2004 by Spirit Walk: Old Wounds and Spirit Walk: Enemy of My Enemy. Under the direction of a new author, 2009 brought forth two more additions to the series: Full Circle and Unworthy. In 2011, another book by the same author called Children of the Storm was released. Other novels – some set during the relaunch period, others during the show's TV run – have been published.    In Star Trek: The Next Generation, James Sloyan portrayed Alidar Jarok (a defecting Romulan admiral) in "The Defector", and Alexander Rozhenko (Worf's son) as an adult in the future, in "Firstborn". In Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, he portrayed the Bajoran scientist Mora Pol and Odo's "father" in the episodes "The Begotten" and "The Alternate". The Star Trek: Voyager episode entitled "Jetrel" featured Sloyan as the title character. Original Series cast member Grace Lee Whitney reprised her role as Janice Rand in "Voyager" episode "Flashback", commemorating the 30th anniversary of Star Trek. Majel Barrett voices the ship's computer, having performed the same role in previous Star Trek series. Dwight Schultz played Reginald Barclay on Star Trek: The Next Generation and in the film Star Trek: First Contact. He appeared in the following Voyager episodes: "Projections", "Pathfinder", "Life Line", "Inside Man", "Author, Author", and "Endgame". John de Lancie plays the mischievous Q, who also annoyed Captain Picard on the Enterprise and Commander Ben Sisko on Deep Space Nine in the Deep Space Nine episode "Q-Less". He appeared in "Death Wish", "The Q and the Grey", and "Q2". Marina Sirtis, as Counselor Deanna Troi from The Next Generation, appears in "Pathfinder", "Life Line", and "Inside Man". Jonathan Frakes played Commander William Riker from The Next Generation, appearing in "Death Wish". LeVar Burton, who played Geordi La Forge on The Next Generation, appeared as Captain LaForge of the USS Challenger in an alternate future in the episode "Timeless". Armin Shimerman, who portrayed Quark on Deep Space 9, appeared in the pilot "Caretaker", continuing a tradition where an existing Star Trek series spawns a spinoff – here, Deep Space Nine to Voyager. Mark Allen Shepherd also appears uncredited as Morn, alongside Quark in the pilot. Original Series cast member George Takei reprised his role as Captain Hikaru Sulu of the USS Excelsior from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. He appeared in "Voyager" episode "Flashback", commemorating the 30th anniversary of Star Trek. Dan Shor, who appeared as the Ferengi Dr. Arridor in The Next Generation episode "The Price", reprised the role in in "Voyager" episode "False Profits", having become stranded in the Delta Quadrant at the end of the Next Generation episode. The Borg Queen, the antagonist from Star Trek: First Contact, makes several appearances in Voyager. Susanna Thompson played the role in the episodes "Unimatrix Zero" and "Dark Frontier"; however, Alice Krige, who played the character in First Contact, reprised the role for the series finale. Aron Eisenberg (Nog of Deep Space Nine) appeared in "Initiations" as a Kazon adolescent named Kar. Gwynyth Walsh (B'Etor of The Next Generation and Generations) appeared in "Random Thoughts" as Chief Examiner Nimira. Jeffrey Combs (Weyoun and Brunt of Deep Space Nine and Shran of Enterprise) appeared in "Tsunkatse" as Norcadian Penk. J. G. Hertzler (Martok of Deep Space Nine and Klingon advocate Kolos in the Enterprise episode: "Judgement") appeared in "Tsunkatse" as an unnamed Hirogen. Suzie Plakson, who portrayed Dr. Selar in the TNG episode "The Schizoid Man" as well as K'Ehleyr, Worf's mate in "The Emissary" and "Reunion", appeared as the female Q in the episode "The Q and the Grey". Kurtwood Smith, who plays Annorax in "Year of Hell" appeared in Star Trek: Deep Space 9 episode "Things Past" as a Cardassian, Thrax. Before this, he also appeared in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country as the President of the Federation. Leonard Crofoot, who appears in "Virtuoso" as a Qomar spectator, acted in the TNG episode Angel One and as the prototype version of Data's daughterLal in the TNG episode The Offspring.

Tony Todd, who played Worf's brother Kurn in the TNG episodes "Sins of the Father", "Redemption", Parts 1 & 2 and the Deep Space Nine episode "Sons of Mogh", also the adult Jake Sisko in the Deep Space Nine episode "The Visitor", played an unnamed Hirogen in the Voyager episode "Prey". Michael Ansara is one of seven actors to play the same character (in his case the Klingon commander Kang) on three different Star Trek TV series – the original series ("Day of the Dove"), Deep Space Nine ("Blood Oath") and Voyager ("Flashback").

Robert Duncan McNeill (Paris) appeared in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "The First Duty" as Starfleet cadet Nicolas Locarno. (The character of Tom Paris was based on Locarno, but he was felt to be 'beyond redemption' for his actions during "The First Duty"; Paramount would also have been obliged by contract to pay royalties to the author of "The First Duty" for the use of the name "Nick Locarno" in every episode). Tim Russ (Tuvok) appeared in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Starship Mine, the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes "Invasive Procedures" and "Through the Looking Glass" (as Mirror Tuvok), and the film Star Trek: Generations, as various characters.

Kate Mulgrew appears again as Kathryn Janeway, promoted to vice admiral, in the film Star Trek Nemesis a year after Voyager ended its run. Robert Duncan McNeill (Paris) and Roxann Dawson (Torres) have also directed episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise.

The sets used for USS Voyager were re-used for the Deep Space Nine episode "Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges" for her sister ship USS Bellerophon (NCC-74705), both of which are Intrepid-class starship. The sickbay set of USS Voyager was also used as the Enterprise-E sickbay in the films Star Trek: First Contact and Star Trek: Insurrection.
