    The International Isle of Man TT (Tourist Trophy) Race The Manx Experience. A Souvenir Guide to the Isle of Man. page 66-67 Gordon N.Kniverton  8th edition  The Manx Experience (1987) Mannin Publishing Ltd is a motorcycle sport event held annually on the Isle of Man in May or June of each year since the inaugural race in 1907.   The Isle of Man TT for many years was the most prestigious motor-cycle race in the world and also seen as the ultimate test for competitors and machines alike.The Guinness Motorcycle Sport Fact Book page 120 by Ian Morrisson Guinness Publishing Ltd (1991) The Bath Press ISBN 0-85112-953-6 The Isle of Man TT has been administered by the Auto-Cycle Union (ACU) (previously the Auto-Cycle Club) since 1907 and is currently managed since 2008 by  ACU Events Ltd, a fully owned subsidiary of the ACU.International Tourist Trophy Regulations 2015 page 1 ACU Events (Isle of Man) Limited (2015) Isle of Man Department of Economic Development The Isle of Man TT has been traditionally run in a time-trial format on public roads closed for racing by the provisions of an Act of Tynwald (the parliament of the Isle of Man). The event consists of one week of practice sessions followed by one week of racing.   It has been a tradition perhaps started by racing competitors in the early 1920s for spectators to tour the Snaefell Mountain Course on motor-cycles during the Isle of Man TT  on "Mad Sunday,"Isle of Man Examiner page 2 12th November 1921 an informal and unofficial sanctioned event held on the SundayHere Is the News: A Chronicle of the 20th Century, Volume 1 page 78 Gordon N.Kniverton & Terry Cringle  Manx Heritage Foundation (1999) The Manx Experience ISBN 9781873120460 between ‘Practice Week’ and ‘Race Week.’ The first Isle of Man TT race was held on Tuesday 28 May 1907 and was called the International Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy.’’Official Programme – International Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy’’ 28th May 1907 pages 1-3 The Auto-Cycle Club (1907). Reproduction (2007) Isle of Man Post Office The event was organised by the Auto-Cycle Club over 10 laps of the Isle of Man St John's Short Course of 15&nbsp;miles 1,470&nbsp;yards for road-legal ‘touring’ motor-cycles with exhaust silencers, saddles, pedals and mud-guards. From 1911 the Isle of Man TT transferred to the much longer Snaefell Mountain Course of 37.40 miles (current length 37.73 miles).  The race programme developed from a single race with two classes for the 1907 Isle of Man TT, expanding in 1911 to two individual races for the 350cc Junior TT motor-cycles and the  Blue Riband event the 500cc Senior TT race. The race did not take place from 1915 to 1919 due to the First World War. It resumed in 1920. A 250cc Lightweight TT race was added to the Isle of Man TT programme in 1922 followed by a Sidecar TT race in 1923. There was no racing on the Isle of Man between 1940 and 1945 due to the Second World War. It recommenced with the Manx Grand Prix in 1946 then the Isle of Man TT in 1947 with a greatly expanded format that included the new Clubman’s TT races.  The Isle of Man TT became part of the FIM Motor-cycle Grand Prix World Championship as the British round of the World Motor-Cycling Championship during the period 1949–1976.  Following  safety concerns with the Snaefell Mountain Course and  problems over inadequate ‘start-money’ for competitors, a boycott of the Isle of Man TT races occurred from the early 1970s by  many of the leading competitors, motor-cycle manufactures and national motor-cycle sporting federations.'Motor-Cycle pages 1 & 6 14th June 1972 In 1976, the Isle of Man TT lost its world championship status and was transferred to the United Kingdom by the FIM and run as the British Grand Motor-Cycle Grand Prix for the 1977 season. The Isle of Man TT Races then became an integral part of the new style TT Formula 1, Formula 2 and Formula 3 World Championships between 1977 to 1990 to develop and maintain the international racing status of the Isle of Man TT races.Isle of Man's Big 3 Race Events : The Spectator Guide. TT (Tourist Trophy), Festival of Motorcycling (incorporating Manx Grand Prix), Southern 100 page 43 Trevor Barret (2014) Lily Publication ISBN 1907945237 The event was redeveloped by the Isle of Man Department of Tourism as the Isle of Man TT Festival from 1989 onwards.  This included new racing events for the new Isle of Man TT Festival programme including the Isle of Man Pre-TT Classic Races in 1989 followed by the Isle of Man Post-TT Races from 1991 and  both held on the Billown Circuit.   In 2013,  the Isle of Man ‘Classic TT’ was developed by the Isle of Man Department of Economic Development and the Auto-Cycle Union for historic racing motor-cycles and along with the Manx Grand Prix now forms part of the ‘Isle of Man Festival of Motorcycling’ now held in late August of each year Motor racing began on the Isle of Man in 1904 with the Gordon Bennett Eliminating Trial, restricted to touring automobiles. As the Motor Car Act 1903 placed a speed restriction of  on automobiles in the UK, Julian Orde, Secretary of the Automobile Car Club of Britain and Ireland approached the authorities in the Isle of Man for the permission to race automobiles on the island's public roads.Island Racer 2004 pp 112–113 Mortons Media Group Ltd. ISBN 9780954244224 The Highways (Light Locomotive) Act 1904 gave permission in the Isle of Man for the  Highlands Course for the 1904 Gordon Bennett Eliminating Trial which was won by Clifford Earl (Napier) in 7 hours 26.5 minutes for five laps () of the Highlands Course. The 1905 Gordon Bennett Trial was held on 30 May 1905 and was again won by Clifford Earl driving a Napier automobile in 6 hours and 6 minutes for six laps of the Highland Course. This was followed in September 1905 with the first Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Race for racing automobiles, now known as the RAC Tourist Trophy and was won by John Napier (Arrol-Johnston) in 6 hours and 9 minutes at an average speed of .TT Pioneers – Early Car Racing in the Isle of Man by Robert Kelly p68 The Manx Experience (1996) The Alden Press ISBN No 1 873120 61 3 For the 1905 Gordon Bennett Eliminating Trial it was decided to run an eliminating trial for motorcycles the day after for a team to represent Great Britain in the International Motor-Cycle Cup Races. An accident at Ramsey Hairpin forced out one of the pre-race favourites and the inability of the motorcycle competitors to climb the steep Mountain Section of the course forced the organisers to use a  section of the Gordon Bennett Trial course. This ran from Douglas south to Castletown and then north to Ballacraine along the primary A3 road and returned to the start at the Quarterbridge in Douglas via Crosby and Glen Vine along the current Snaefell Mountain Course in the reverse direction. The 1905 International Motor-Cycle Cup Race for five laps () was won by J.S.

The races held on the Clypse Course during the period 1954-1959 were the more traditional full grid starts along with the 1924 Lightweight TT Race and Clubmen TT Races from 1948, which were also "mass-start" races.  The current format is a "clutch start" and race competitors will be "started singly at 10 second intervals".2015 International Tourist Trophy Regulations page 22  ACU Events Isle of Man Limited (2015) Isle of Man Department of Economic Development Entrants must be in possession of a valid National Entrants or FIM Sponsors Licence for Road Racing.

For the 1926 event the Sidecar and Ultra-Lightweight TT classes were dropped due to lack of entries. The Sidecar race was re-introduced from the 1954 event for Sidecars not exceeding 500&nbsp;cc engine capacity, run on the Clypse Course. A non-championship 750&nbsp;cc class for sidecars was introduced at the 1968 event. For the 1976 event the race was held over two-legs. From 1975, the previous 500&nbsp;cc and 750&nbsp;cc classes for Sidecars were replaced by a 1000&nbsp;cc engine capacity class.  The new FIM Formula 2 class for Sidecars was introduced for the 1990 Isle of Man TT. The 2015 specifications for entries into the Sidecar TT race are:   For the 1911 Isle of Man TT, the first TT event using the Snaefell Mountain Course or Mountain Course, two separate races were introduced. The first event was a four lap Junior TT race and a separate Senior TT race for 500&nbsp;cc single-cylinder and 585&nbsp;cc twin-cylinder motorcycles, over five laps of the new  Snaefell Mountain Course. The new technical challenges of the Mountain Course forced changes on entrants and motorcycle manufacturers alike. The American Indian motorcycle factory fitted a two-speed gearbox and chain-drive. This proved to be the winning combination when Oliver Godfrey won the 1911 Senior TT race riding an Indian at an average speed of . Fitted with an obsolete six-speed belt drive, Charlie Collier riding a Matchless motorcycle finished second in the 1911 Senior TT race and was later disqualified for illegal refuelling. During an early morning practice session for the 1911 Isle of Man TT races, Victor Surridge died after crashing his Rudge motorcycle at Glen Helen, the first death of a competitor on the Snaefell Mountain Course and the first death in the Isle of Man of a person in an automotive accident.TT Topics and Tales by David Wright - Amulree Publications (4 April 2006)  ISBN 1901508099 * 1911 For single cylinder motorcycles not exceeding 500&nbsp;cc engine capacity and 585&nbsp;cc twin cylinder motorcycles. * 1912–1939 For motorcycles not exceeding 500&nbsp;cc engine capacity. * 1947–1948 For motorcycles not exceeding 500&nbsp;cc engine capacity and a ban on engine supercharging. * 1949–1976 FIM World Championship event for motorcycles not exceeding 500&nbsp;cc engine capacity. * 1977–1984 for motorcycles not exceeding 500&nbsp;cc engine capacity. * 1985–2004 for motorcycles complying with ACU TT Formula 1 rules not exceeding 1,010&nbsp;cc engine capacity. * 2004 onwards for motorcycles complying with ACU/FIM Superbike rules not exceeding 1,000&nbsp;cc engine capacity.

Starting from the 2010 races, the TT Zero event over one lap () of the Snaefell Mountain Course replaced the TTXGP. The TT Zero event as an officially sanctioned TT race is for racing motorcycles where "The technical concept is for motorcycles (two wheeled) to be powered without the use of carbon based fuels and have zero toxic/noxious emissions".REGULATIONS TT ZERO – 2010 International Tourist Trophy – Isle of Man 29 May – 11 June p27 ACU Events Ltd (2010) The Isle of Man Government offered a prize of £10,000 for the first entrant to exceed the prestigious  (22 minutes and 38.388 seconds) average speed around the Mountain Course. This was achieved by Michael Rutter of team MotoCzysz in the 2012 race, and has been exceeded every year since.  1924 was the first time the Ultra-Lightweight TT race took place for motorcycles not exceeding 175&nbsp;cc engine capacity. It was won by Jack Porter, riding a New Imperial motorcycle at an average speed of  over three laps of the Snaefell mountain course. The Ultra-Lightweight class was re-introduced in 1951 for motorcycles not exceeding 125&nbsp;cc until discontinued in 1974, and then re-introduced for 1989, again for two-stroke 125&nbsp;cc motorcycles, until dropped again due to lack of entries after 2004.

Accessed 19 October 2015 A Production TT for roadster-based motorcycles having classes for maximum engine capacities of 250&nbsp;cc, 500&nbsp;cc and 750&nbsp;cc was introduced from 1967 until 1976 when the class was discontinued. The Production TT was reintroduced for the 1984 races in three classes, reduced to two classes on safety grounds for the 1990 races. For the 2005 races the Superstock class replaced the previous 1000&nbsp;cc & 600&nbsp;cc Production TT classes that had been part of the race schedule since 1989.  At the TT races there is usually one week of practice and one week of racing. Historically there was an early morning practice session from 05:00-07:30 am but this was discontinued from the 2004 races. During an early morning practice at the 1927 Isle of Man TT, Archie Birkin, brother of Tim Birkin of the Bentley Boys, was killed at Rhencullen. From 1928 practice sessions for the Isle of Man TT Races and Manx Grand Prix were held on closed roads. Evening practice sessions were introduced for the 1937 Isle of Man TT and continue to this day. The Thursday afternoon practice session from 13:45-17:00, introduced in the late 1950s, was discontinued from the Centenary races in 2007. A schedule for practice sessions is announced each year well in advance. For the 2016 races a provisional schedule was announced by mid-July 2015, and changes in the schedule were highlighted. But for example, the 2015 event began with a Saturday evening untimed practice session from 18:00 - 21:30, with the public roads that comprise the Snaefell Mountain Course closed. The section of the primary A18 Snaefell Mountain Road from Ramsey Hairpin to Creg-ny-Baa was to close at 16:45 for the practice periods (from 17:00 hours from the Bungalow), 1 hour and 15 minutes before the rest of the course.ROADS CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC TT ROAD RACES 2015 Isle of Man Department of Infastructure -Rheynn Arraghey Bun-Troggalys Public Notice (2015) 1982 Road Racing Act (Isle of Man) "Notice is given that the Department of Infrastructure has made Orders under the Road Race Act 1982 & the Highways Act 1986.  The Tourist Trophy Road Race Order 2015 permits the promoters to hold practices,races and parades during the TT Festival period." The first practice session in 2015 was to provide four controlled laps for newcomers, two for new Solo competitors and two for new Sidecar competitors. Competitors would be escorted for one lap of the Mountain Course by the Travelling Marshals at a steady pace and accompanied by experienced Isle of Man TT and/or Manx Grand Prix competitors. The schedule for the first Saturday untimed session in 2015 was: 18:20 – 18:45 Solo Motor-Cycles Newcomers Speed Control Lap 18:35 – 19:00 Sidecar Newcomers' Control Lap 18:50 – 19:50 Lightweight TT / Newcomers (all solo classes) 19:55 – 20:50 Sidecar practice session. The main practice and timed practice sessions are usually held on Monday-Friday of the next week. The public roads forming the Mountain Course were to be closed in 2015 between 18:00 – 21:30 for the Solo and Sidecar classes. Some would-be racers need to qualify for races by achieving satisfactory practice times during these sessions. Schedule for the five day timed session Monday-Friday of practice week in 2015: 18:20 – 19:55 Solo Motor-Cycles timed practice session. 20:00 – 20:50 Sidecar timed practice session.

Mad Sunday, 7 June: No practice sessions were scheduled during "Mad Sunday", a day when many fans ride the TT course themselves. An exception to this non-scheduling was in 2013 when there was racing on the afternoon of Mad Sunday. In 2013, Inspector Derek Flint said: "Even though the benefits of the mountain being one way are in place for the entire two weeks these days, Mad Sunday is traditionally a time for that little bit of extra exuberance, which creates us problems when people run out of skill, then run out of road".  Police are out in force, and in 2013  large numbers of fans were expected to ride due to very favourable weather forecasts. Monday 8 June: 12:30 – 13:00 Sidecar timed practice session. Wednesday 10 June: 15:50 – 16:45 Solo Motor-Cycles timed practice session for the 2015 Isle of Man TT Races.
