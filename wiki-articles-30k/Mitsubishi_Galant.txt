 The Mitsubishi Galant is an automobile that was manufactured by Mitsubishi between 1969 and 2012. The name was derived from the French word galant, meaning "chivalrous".Fact & Figures 2005, p.33, Mitsubishi Motors website There have been nine distinct generations, and cumulative sales now exceed five million.History and profile of the Mitsubishi Galant, Mitsubishi Motors South Africa website It began as a compact sedan, but over the course of its life has evolved into a larger mid-size car. Initial production was only based in Japan, but since 1994 the American market has been served by vehicles assembled at the former Diamond-Star Motors (DSM) facility in Normal, Illinois. The first generation of the car, initially known as the Colt Galant, was released in December 1969 at a new Mitsubishi Japanese dealership called Galant Shop. The design was dubbed "Dynawedge" by Mitsubishi, referring to the influence of aerodynamics on the silhouette. Three models were available, powered by the new 'Saturn' engine in 1.3 (AI model) or 1.5&nbsp;L (AII and AIII) configurations. 1.4 and 1.6 litre versions (14L and 16L) replaced these in September 1971. A larger  1.7 arrived for the top GS model in January 1973. Initially only available as a four-door sedan, a five-door estate and two-door hardtop (A53) variant were added in 1970, the hardtop being Mitsubishi's first production passenger car with full side windows and no side pillars. In March 1973, with only two months of production left, the cleaner "MCA-II" version of the 1.6 arrived. With  it was three horsepower down on the regular version. The Galant was offered as a competitor to the Toyota Corona, Nissan Bluebird and Mazda Capella. It became Mitsubishi's first car to be sold in the United States in 1971 when the Chrysler Corporation, the company's new partner and stakeholder, began importing the car as the Dodge Colt. It was also produced by Chrysler Australia and sold alongside the larger Chrysler Valiant models as the Chrysler Valiant Galant.Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946–1981, pages 289–299  From 1970, a fastback coupé model was developed, the Galant GTO. Fashioned after contemporary American muscle cars, the hardtop GTO was available with a choice of two "Saturn" engines and the 2-litre Astron 80, and was available until 1975. The nameplate was sufficiently highly regarded in Japan for it to be resurrected for the 1990 Mitsubishi GTO coupé. A second, more compact coupé was introduced on a chassis shortened by 12&nbsp;cm in 1971, the Galant FTO. Powered by the 4G41 1.4&nbsp;L engine, it too would leave a legacy for the company to return to in the 1990s with the Mitsubishi FTO. Although the earlier Colt had been imported in limited numbers, this generation, in 1.6&nbsp;litre coupé form only, was the first model to establish the Mitsubishi brand in New Zealand from 1971 when newly appointed distributor Todd Motors, which also imported and assembled Chrysler and Hillman, started selling a small number of Japanese-assembled cars to supplement its mainstream Hillman Avenger and Hunter models. The coupe was assembled in New Zealand from 1972, firstly at Todd's Petone factory, on the Avenger/Hunter line and, from 1974, at the brand-new purpose-built factory in Porirua (closed in 1998).   The second generation Mitsubishi Colt Galant A11* series was built from 1973 until 1976. Introduced on 24 May 1973 (on sale 1 June) in the Japanese domestic market, the second generation Galant was more widely exported as Mitsubishi's ambitions grew. It was again sold by Chrysler in many different guises; as the Dodge Colt in the United States, as the Plymouth Colt and Plymouth Cricket in Canada (from 1974), as the Chrysler Valiant Galant and as the Chrysler Galant in Australia, and in Europe as the Colt Galant. Transmissions were now all floor mounted and include a four-speed manual and a five-speed unit for sportier models. A three-speed automatic transmission was also available. The smaller 1600 engine was also available in the cleaner "MCA-II" version right from 1973, a model which met Japan's 1975 emissions standards. This version was marginally less powerful, with 97 PS (71&nbsp;kW) rather than 100 PS (74&nbsp;kW) engine seen in the previous model.   This new Galant model was more curvaceous, influenced by contemporary "coke bottle styling", and featured a range of larger 'Astron' engines developing up to 125 PS in 2000&nbsp;cc form to complement the 'Saturn' units. During the second generation, the first Astron 80 engines were introduced in some markets using Mitsubishi's newly developed "Silent Shaft" balance shaft technology for reduced vibration and noise. Body styles remained the same as the first gen Colt Galants offered in sedan, wagon and hardtop pillar-less two-door coupe. New models were added to the line up, including GL-II, SL-5, GT and GS-II. The Estate (A112V, sold as a commercial vehicle in Japan) was only available with the 100&nbsp;PS 1600 engine, in Custom, GL, or SL-5 (with a five-speed manual transmission). It had vestigial wood panelling, only a narrow strip on the tailgate. In New Zealand the hardtop, now with an 1855&nbsp;cc engine was again assembled by Todd Motors at Porirua. The sedan was not offered as Todd was planning to assemble the larger Galant Sigma sedan and wagon range from late 1977 and they were still importing the British Avenger and Hunter models. The third generation of the car was introduced in 1976, and was known as Galant Σ (Sigma). In many export markets the car was simply known as the Galant. At that time, the Dodge Colt in America was actually a Mitsubishi Lancer, not the Galant anymore, but nonetheless the Galant Wagon variant was sold with the Dodge Colt label in the US and Canada. In Australia, where the car was made locally at Chrysler's Clovelly Park plant, it was known as the Chrysler Sigma and, after the buyout of Chrysler Australia by Mitsubishi, as the Mitsubishi Sigma. Australian content was quite high and included a locally-made 2.6-litre 'Astron' four (introduced 1980) which, in December 1985, replaced the 1.6, 1.85 and two-litre engines used in other export markets. The wagon version was introduced in 1977, a little while after the sedans. A new coupé (two door) was introduced in 1976 to replace the Galant GTO. It was known in Japan as the Galant Λ (Lambda). The coupe was sold in the United States between 1978 and 1980 as the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Sapporo. Mitsubishi introduced the MCA-Jet engine for Japan and other emissions-controlled markets with its latest Galant. This incorporated the "Jet Valve", a secondary intake valve which improved emissions without necessitating the need for a completely redesigned cylinder head. In 1978, Mitsubishi in Japan established a dedicated dealership sales channel called () to sell the Galant and other selected vehicles. After late 1977 the 1850 variant was discontinued, as Mitsubishi focussed their efforts on making the 1600 and the 2000 engines pass the new, stricter emissions standards. The Galant range received a facelift with single rectangular headlights in March 1978. Only seven months later this front design was replaced with one featuring twin square headlights. Models with engines which passed the new 1978 standards changed from the A120 to the A130 range. Mitsubishi had limited resources, and the large choice of engines for the Galant lineup was reduced to one 1.6 and one 2.0, with , at the beginning of the 1979 model year.Automobile Guide Book 1978/1979, pp. 147–149   Todd Motors initially assembled 1.6GL, 1.85GLX and two-litre GLS sedan models for New Zealand, with the GLS getting a five-speed manual transmission as standard with three-speed auto optional. These were the first NZ-assembled Mitsubishis to have rear screen demisters as standard. Early cars had conventional rod-suspended headliners developed locally to meet local content rules but these were notorious for collapsing on to the passengers' heads and were quickly replaced by newly developed, glued-in moulded foam liners. The range was later revised to add the wagon and drop the 1.85-litre engine. The third generation Galant was the recipient of the Car of the Year award in South Africa in 1977.Mitsubishi Motors History, Mitsubishi Motors UK website    Mitsubishi's fourth iteration of the Galant Σ/Eterna Σ debuted many new innovations for Mitsubishi. Their new 'Sirius' engine was offered in turbocharged form for performance enthusiasts in some markets, with  for Japanese market cars and  for those export markets unencumbered by strict emissions rules. For economy, an 'Astron' 4D55, the first turbodiesel engine in a Japanese passenger car, was also offered. Unusually, the fourth Galant was never offered with a naturally aspirated diesel engine. The 2.3 Turbo D was first shown at the 1980 Paris Motor Show. A new electronic fuel injection system was introduced on some versions of the gasoline Astron engine. The car was sold as the Mitsubishi Galant in most export markets, although in both Australia and New Zealand it was known as the Mitsubishi Sigma. For the second generation in a row Mitsubishi could claim to be building an award-winning car, as this was chosen as Car of the Year in New Zealand in 1981. The cars sold there were again locally assembled with 1.6 and two-litre engines, and a choice of transmissions and trim. As elsewhere (see below), the wagon versions carried over the old body style with a new nose and interior. The fourth generation sedan and coupé were both slightly larger than the third generation cars. Additional emphasis was given to ergonomics, aerodynamics, and safety. Shoulder room, leg room, and head space were all increased, and the trunk was slightly enlarged for more luggage capacity. The interior was made quieter with additional carpeting and other acoustic dampening materials and a double-thickness front bulkhead. The wagon version was also changed, although from the firewall back the vehicle remained the same as the previous version. Production of the wagon version continued in Australia until 1987 when it was replaced by the new Magna. From 1982 to 1983, some of the Australian Sigmas, which had the carried-over 2.0 or 2.6-litre locally made inline-four engine, were exported to the United Kingdom with the Lonsdale badge, in en effort at circumventing the voluntary import quota restrictions adopted by Japanese manufacturers. However the car was unsuccessful, and for 1983 and 1984 it carried Mitsubishi Sigma badges in the UK before imports were finally discontinued. The two door coupé was also redesigned for 1980 and was sold through 1983. While continuing with the Galant Λ/Eterna Λ label for the domestic Japanese market, the fourth generation was known as the Mitsubishi Scorpion in Australia, and the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Sapporo in the United States. A fifth-generation model shifted to front-wheel drive for 1983 as a four-door sedan and hardtop (with different styling). All new chassis numbers, from E11A to E19A, marked the change. This generation formed the basis of the widened (by 4&nbsp;inches/100mm) Mitsubishi Magna produced in Australia from 1985, the same year in which Mitsubishi won Bild am Sonntag's Das Goldene Lenkrad (Golden Steering Wheel) award in Germany for the Galant and Wheels magazine's Car of the Year for the Magna."Mitsubishi Motors' History, 1981–1990", Mitsubishi Motors South Africa website Mitsubishi Motors codenamed these cars as "YF" and "YFW"—"W" for "wide", respectively. The station wagon version was effectively replaced by the Mitsubishi Chariot in most markets. The Galant was the third Japanese car to adopt four-wheel anti-lock brakes, using Bosch's ABS system. Export trim levels were often engine-specific, depending on the market: GL models were offered with either 1.6-litre or 1.8-litre engines, GLS models (GLX in some markets) had 2.0-litre engines (badged 2000 GLS) and Diesel versions had a 1.8-litre Sirius turbodiesel engine. The diesel model did not have a trim level, it was simply the 1800 TD. Vehicles in Japan installed with the four speed transmission were equipped with what Mitsubishi called Super Shift, essentially installing a transfer case, without adding another driveshaft to the rear wheels. Super Shift was no longer offered with the introduction of the five-speed manual transmission. In the Japanese market there was also a parallel "Eterna" lineup with very minor differences in appearance and equipment. Equipment levels in Japan had more interesting names, ranging from the LS and LG via Super Saloon, Super Touring, Super Exceed, GSR-X, up to the most luxurious Royal. The top models for Japan (the "Super Exceed" sedan or "VR" hardtop) were powered by the  (JIS gross, later only 170&nbsp;PS were claimed) turbocharged and intercooled "Sirius Dash 3/2 valve" engine. This engine switched between two and three valves per cylinder to combine high top-end power with low-end drivability as well being economical in operation. Sales in the United States began with the 1985 model year; this was the first time that the Galant was sold stateside since the station wagon was marketed as a Dodge Colt a few years earlier. This generation was largely replaced in 1988 by the sixth generation Galant (see below). The widened Australian-made version, however, remained in production until 1991 when it was replaced by a new generation Magna, whereas the Japanese hardtop range was produced until it was replaced by the new Sigma/Diamante version in 1990. In addition, the taxi-spec sedan fitted with a 1.8-litre LPG engine remained in production for Japanese commercial use until December 1999, when Mitsubishi abandoned that market. For its last three years of production, this model received an LPG-version of the 1834&nbsp;cc "4G93" engine. The fifth generation Galant was introduced to the New Zealand market in mid-1984, as the Mitsubishi Sigma. Assembled by Mitsubishi's New Zealand distributors, Todd Motors, the Sigma was available with the choice of 1.8 and 2.0L engines, the 2.0 having the option of automatic transmission, and availability with a turbocharger on certain models. Several trim levels were offered, GL, GLX, GSR, Super Saloon and SE. The top SE versions notably featured 'Sigma' branded alloy wheels, digital instrumentation, climate controlled air conditioning, cruise control, speed-dependent intermittent wipers and a salmon-brown coloured interior treatment, the treatment changing deep red colour as a running change in 1985 on this model. Further running changes concerned the rear styling. For the initial 1984 production run the rear numberplate was located above the bumper, however for 1985 and 1986 the plate was relocated to below the bumper, in the manner of the Japanese domestic market Galant models. New taillights were fitted for 1987, the rear numberplate reverting to its original place above the bumper. 1987 was a key year for Mitsubishi in New Zealand, when it bought out Todd Motors' automotive operations. Although the sixth generation Galant was introduced for 1988, the older fifth generation bodyshell stayed in production alongside it. Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand intentionally decided to retain the fifth generation sedan bodystyle for a new, unique to New Zealand, flagship model—the  3.0-liter V6 engined V3000. The V3000 was developed specifically to give Mitsubishi New Zealand a six-cylinder family car, suitable for towing boats and caravans, to compete with the imported Ford Falcon (EA) and Holden Commodore (VN) models. While the rear styling of the previous Sigma model was retained, the frontal treatment was changed to now feature a more formal, upright chrome grille (the bonnet and grille were from the top-of the-line Sigma SE), and uprated suspension. The V3000 was available in basic Executive, mid-range Super Saloon, and top-of-the-range SEi trim levels, the latter with luxury trim and digital dashboard. Later a sports version Elante was introduced, based on the Executive. The V6 engine combined with relatively low weight and gearing ensured excellent performance, New Zealand's traffic patrol selected them as patrol cars to replace the turbocharged Sigma GSR. These police cars had the Elante suspension pack, which was an option on other models. For 1990, the V3000 was further updated and now featured the front styling of the Eterna hardtop. New Zealand was the only market where this restyling was applied to the fifth generation four-door sedan bodyshell. Assembly of this model continued until 1991, when it was replaced by the second-generation Australian Mitsubishi Magna TR V6 range, which continued to be known as Mitsubishi V3000 for the New Zealand market.   The hardtop sedan bodywork was used in export markets as well, where it received a six-window design unlike for its Japanese market counterparts. It was marketed under different names; "Galant Σ" or "Eterna Σ" (Sigma) in Japan, "Sapporo" in Europe, and in the US as "Galant Σ" (1988 model year) followed by plain "Sigma" (1989 to 1990 model years). The "Galant Σ" was released for the 1988 model year, but the "Sigma" version with updated alloy wheels began US sales began in August 1988 for the 1989 model year and continued until 1990. These cars were available with a 3.0-liter V6 (North America, only with automatic transmission) or 2.4-liter four-cylinder engines (Europe) in the export. In the domestic Japanese market the hardtops received 2.0-litre fours, or the smaller 2.0-litre 6G71 V6 engine from 1986, shared with the Mitsubishi Debonair limousine. The hardtop range continued to be available until 1990 as Mitsubishi's most luxurious offering in most export markets, until the Sigma/Diamante replaced it. It also continued on sale in Japan, but only as the Eterna Sigma after a facelift in May 1989. In Japan the hardtop was available with a 1.8-liter four at the bottom of the range and with the large 3.0-liter V6 in the top "Duke" version after this makeover.Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1990, pp. 563–564 The European market Sapporo took its bow at the 1987 Frankfurt Motor Show; the large 2.4-liter 4G64 "Sirius" four-cylinder producing  at 5,000&nbsp;rpm ( for the catalyzed version).Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1990, pp. 565–566  In 1987 the same platform was used for a sixth-generation model which adopted taller, rounded styling. This generation won the Car of the Year Japan award in 1987 and the GS model became Motor Trend's Import Car of the Year in 1989."Motor Trend Import Car of the Year Complete Winners List", MotorTrend.com This Galant began American sales in 1989 side by side with the previous generation Sigma. Mitsubishi developed Dynamic ECS, the world’s first production semi-active electronically controlled suspension system in passenger cars; the system was first incorporated in the 1987 Galant model."Mitsubishi Galant", Mitsubishi Motors South Africa website"Mitsubishi Motors history 1981–1990", Mitsubishi Motors South Africa website"MMC's new Galant.", Malay Mail, Byline: Asian Auto, Asia Africa Intelligence Wire, 16-SEP-02 (registration required) The Galant range underwent a minor facelift in 1991, with new grilles and other modifications. Also in 1991, Mitsubishi Motors Company completed a new assembly facility at Barcelona, Venezuela, with the Galant being one of the first models produced. It was sold there until 1994 under the ZX, MF, MS and MX names, which identified the various levels of equipment and transmission. The Sigma designation disappeared with the 1990 model. A new hardtop liftback model was added in 1988, called the (). and in Japan, the Eterna was only sold at a specific retail chain called Car Plaza. This generation Galant was also sold in Canada as the Dodge 2000GTX and Eagle 2000GTX. The five-door liftback version was never offered in North America, where buyers prefer traditional sedans. Sales ended in 1993. A limited edition based on the GTi-16v model was introduced in 1989, modified by German tuning company AMG (now owned by Mercedes-Benz), with mildly uprated engine () and unique bodykit, alloy wheels, and full leather interior. The AMG appearance treatment was also achieved on the Debonair for 1986. The sixth generation was also the first to see the introduction of the VR-4 variant, which was the basis for Mitsubishi's participation in the 1988–1992 World Rally Championships. The Galant's 4G63 two litre DOHC turbocharged engine and 4WD transmission was later adopted for the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution with little modification, and would remain in production for fifteen years. Starting in 1989, the Mitsubishi Galant V-series were produced for the Japanese market as a sporty alternative to the regular Galant range. The lineup consisted of Viento and VX-S/VZ-S models featuring the higher output 1.8 and 2.0 Turbo DOHC engines with both automatic and manual transmissions available. The V-series featured the VR-4 interior, exterior design and updated bumpers (without side skirts), clear indicator lens covers, optional two-tone body paint, as well as standard air conditioning, full electrics, rear windscreen wiper, spoiler and alloy wheels. The series was discontinued in 1992, when the next generation Galant appeared.

A Japan-only hardtop derivative called the () (French for emerald) was also launched in 1992. The width dimensions of the model sold in Japan no longer complied with Japanese Government dimension regulations, and buyers were now liable for additional taxes, which affected sales. This generation marked a substantial change in suspension design. The front switched from struts to a multi-link structure featuring two lower arms and one upper arm. The rear switched from a beam axle to a newly designed multi-link system. Both designs would carry over to the second generation Mitsubishi Eclipse and its sister vehicles. For 1992, the emergence of the homologated Lancer Evolution meant the top-spec Galant VR-4 was no longer constrained by sporting regulations. The new generation became a less overtly sporting vehicle. The existing, proven 4WD transmission was carried over, in keeping with Mitsubishi's reputation for performance-enhancing technology, but the old inline-four was superseded by a smoother twin-turbo 2.0-litre V6, and mated either to a conventional five-speed manual, or a four-speed INVECS auto complete with "fuzzy logic", which allowed the transmission to adapt to the driver's style and road conditions "on the fly". It was capable of dispatching the 0–60 sprint in about 6.5&nbsp;seconds, and if derestricted could reach about . Variants of the VR-4 using the same engine and drivetrain were sold in Japan as the Eterna XX-4 liftback (1992) and Galant Sports GT liftback (1994–96). Production in the United States began on May 24, 1993 when the first seventh generation Galant rolled off the assembly line in Normal, Illinois. In 1994, a slightly upgraded GS version was available with a  twin cam engine, speed-sensitive steering, rear stabilizer bar, and an available manual transmission. In Europe were also available  naturally aspirated 2.5&nbsp;L 24-valve DOHC engine, which was mounted with four-wheel drive, 5-speed manual transmission and four-wheel-steering. Body styles were 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback. Rear differential was not available with limited-slip. In option were sunroof, A/C, cruise control, power windows, central locking, electrical heated seats and electrical side-mirrors. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test ratings for 1997 and 1998 Galant:    The eighth-generation 1996 model continued the 1992's design themes but a five-door station wagon (known in Japan as the Mitsubishi Legnum) was added while the five-door liftback was dropped. This model won the 1996–97 Car of the Year Japan award for the second time. Despite being superseded in the US and Europe from 2003, it remained on sale in other countries until 2006. In Japan, the Legnum was sold only at a specific retail chain called "Car Plaza", while the Galant remained exclusive to Galant Shop locations. The name "Legnum" derives from the Latin word regnum, meaning regal power or rank. This model was also produced in Barcelona, Venezuela, at the only Mitsubishi plant in Latin America. At the beginning, the Galant was marketed in that country under the "MX" and "MF" names in 1997 and 1998 (featuring a manual or INVECS-II semi-automatic transmission respectively), then kept the Galant name until the end of its production in 2006. Although the equipment options were limited, the VR-4 appearance package was offered in that market. The American market Galant, introduced on July 7, 1998, graduated to the US Environmental Protection Agency's mid-size class. The front suspension switched from double-wishbones to struts, though the rear was upgraded with a stabilizer bar standard on all but the base DE model. The ES, LS and GTZ models were offered with a  V6 engine, the 6G72 3.0&nbsp;L, mated to a standard four-speed conventional automatic. Another difference from Asian and European models was the lack of ABS, which was only installed on 3.0&nbsp;L models. Mitsubishi opted to further develop the technology in its range-topping VR-4, which was now powered by an enlarged 2.5&nbsp;L V6 twin turbo. The car features either a conventional five-speed manual or INVECS-II transmission. Some models were also fitted with the same advanced active yaw control (AYC) as the Lancer Evolution, to give it greater agility than would be expected of such a large vehicle. Finally, as with the rest of the range, the VR-4 could now be had either as a Galant sedan or as a Legnum station wagon. In some Asian markets Mitsubishi offered a 2.0&nbsp;L MIVEC version of the 6A12, a high revving naturally aspirated V6 race engine with a sports ECU engine management module, badged as the "Galant 2.0A", or alternately as the "VR-M". This engine is also found on Mitsubishi's midsize sports car FTO-GPX. Output was placed at  and  of torque. The larger 2.5&nbsp;L 6A13 was more common in the rest of the world. In 1998 the company introduced the Mitsubishi Aspire. Externally identical to the regular Galant, the new model name denoted the newly introduced gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines.

It was announced at the 2003 New York International Auto Show in April for the 2004 model year, following the exhibition of the SSS concept sedan at the North American International Auto Show three years before."Mitsubishi's SSS Concept Vehicle Defines New 'Enhanced Utility Sedan'", The Auto Channel, January 12, 2000 The ninth-generation United States-sourced model is available for sale only in a few regional markets, namely the United States, Puerto Rico, Russia, Ukraine and Arabia. Russia began sourcing its Galants from the United States from 2006. The Arabian markets began sourcing their Galants from the United States from the 2007 model year. The Galant had also been available in Canada and Mexico until the 2010 and 2009 model years, respectively. A size increase resulted in slightly more interior space and a weight gain of several hundred pounds. The four-cylinder engine, while still 2.4 liters in displacement, upgraded from Mitsubishi's 4G64 design to the newer 4G69 design, resulting in a horsepower increase from 140 to 160. Likewise, the V6 jumped from a 3.0-liter with  to a 3.8 with 235. All North American Galants gained all-wheel disc brakes but lost their rear stabilizer bar. A Ralliart version joined for 2007, finally upgrading the V6 to a class-competitive  while also adding a firmer suspension, front strut tower bar, rear stabilizer bar, and eighteen-inch alloy wheels. For 2008, the trimming of models left the Ralliart as the only V6 model, and the Galant skips the 2008 model year in Canada, only to return in 2009 with the facelifted model. Four-cylinder Galant models sold in California, Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont are certified as Partial Zero-Emissions Vehicles (PZEV), with the engine rated .Chicago '08 Preview: 2009 Mitsubishi Galant gets fresh face This iteration of the Mitsubishi Galant only went on sale in the Middle East region for the 2007 model year, with a 2.4-liter engine and a 3.8-liter engine, imported from the United States. Osamu Masuko, the CEO of Mitsubishi Motors, indicated that the ninth generation of the Galant would be the last to be manufactured in North America, to be replaced on the MMNA production line in Illinois by smaller vehicles which are more likely to appeal to export markets."Mitsubishi CEO: Let's halt Galant production in U.S.", Automotive News, November 3, 2008 The final Mitsubishi Galant rolled off the assembly line on August 30, 2012. In Japan only, the market position held by the Galant, which was discontinued in Japan June 15, 2005, was replaced by the Nissan sourced Mitsubishi Proudia, which is a rebadged Nissan Fuga. 2006 The Galant receives some cosmetic changes, such as an AC adapter, and a standard MP3 jack, and upgrades to the interior. 2007 In 2007, the Galant was restyled, this included an interior upgrade, with a navigation, audio system, and updates to the interior. 2009 In 2009, the Galant was restyled again, to make it look newer 2004–2006 Mitsubishi Galant (US) 2007-2008 Mitsubishi Galant (US) 2009 Mitsubishi Galant (US) A four-cylinder Sport Edition was added for the 2009 model year. Galant Sport models include new standard factory value packages as standard. Sportronic automatic transmission is standard in all models, with a four-speed for four-cylinder engines and a five-speed for V6 engines.   Mitsubishi also assembles and markets a Taiwan made version of the ninth-generation Galant. In Taiwan, this version is known as the Mitsubishi Grunder. Taiwan was one of the first regions outside the Americas to market the ninth generation vehicle, when the Galant Grunder was launched in December 2004 with a unique front end. It has a  version of the 2.4 liter MIVEC engine and four-speed automatic (INVECS-II), and comes in either SEi format or as the better equipped EXi model.
