   The 2003–04 season was the 124th season of Association football in England. Arsenal completed the season without losing a league match. Leeds United avoided going into administration, but were unable to avoid relegation and lost their place in the Premiership along with Leicester City and Wolves. Norwich City won promotion to the Premiership as Champions after nine years in Division 1. They were joined by runners-up West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace who beat West Ham in the play-off final. Wimbledon completed their relocation to Milton Keynes and moved into the former England National Hockey Stadium, which would be used as a temporary home until a new stadium was built at Denbigh North. At the end of the season, following the Dons' relegation, club directors changed its name to Milton Keynes Dons. Bradford City and Walsall joined them in relegation to League 1. Plymouth Argyle were Division Two champions and ensured that they would be playing in the second tier of English football for the first time in 11 years. QPR joined them together with Brighton who won the play-off. At the bottom Rushden & Diamonds were relegated to Division Three along with Grimsby Town  who suffered a second consecutive relegation after losing the last game of the season. Notts County and Wycombe Wanderers were also relegated. In the same division, Oldham Athletic were in financial difficulties but they avoide going into administration after a takeover bid was confirmed. Doncaster Rovers became Division Three champions to earn their second successive promotion, having been Conference play-off winners the previous season. They had not played above the league's lowest tier for nearly 20 years; they were joined by Hull City, Torquay United and play-off winners Huddersfield Town. Carlisle United were relegated to the Conference from Division Three. They had spent all but two of the previous 17 seasons in the league's fourth tier. York City followed them out of the Football League after a poor second half of the season. Chester City and Shrewsbury Town were promoted to the Football League from the Football Conference. Telford United, who had been members of the Conference for every season since its formation in 1979, went out of business at the end of a season in which they had reached the Fourth Round of the FA Cup. The club was quickly reformed as A.F.C. Telford United and joined the Northern Premier League. Despite the Premiership title picture being a three-horse race for much of the campaign, Arsenal remained unbeaten all season long and clinched the title with 90 points and an 11-point gap over runners-up Chelsea, who had been most people's favourites for the title after a £100million summer spending spree. After losing defender Rio Ferdinand to an eight-month ban for missing a drugs test in September, defending champions Manchester United turned in some lacklustre performances during the second half of the season, which put paid to their hopes of retaining their crown and restricting them to a third-place finish, some 15 points behind Arsenal. Solace came in the form of a record 11th FA Cup triumph, defeating Millwall 3-0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium. Liverpool were the final team to qualify for the Champions League, finishing in fourth place, but leaving them 30 points behind Arsenal and slightly closer to the relegation zone than the title winners, and manager Gerard Houllier was sacked shortly after the season's end. League Cup winners Middlesbrough qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time in their history, joined by fifth-placed Newcastle United, who edged out Aston Villa - who had recovered from as low as eighteenth place in November - on goal difference. Seventh-placed Charlton Athletic and eighth-placed Bolton Wanderers both achieved their highest league finishes since the 1950s, while ninth-placed Fulham (many people's pre-season relegation favourites) defied the odds under 33-year-old manager Chris Coleman and achieved the highest league finish of their history. Birmingham City, in their second season since promotion, also enjoyed a solid year, finishing tenth. Portsmouth, also considered favourites for relegation pre-season, finished a respectable 13th in their first top-flight season for 16 years, despite finishing behind bitter rivals Southampton, who recovered from the sudden resignation of Gordon Strachan in March to finish 12th. Newly promoted Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers both went down after just one season (Wolves not gaining one away win all season), while Leeds United's Premiership status was crushed under a multi-million pound debt which had been mounting relentlessly for the best part of three years, as their relegation ultimately became a matter of when rather than if, ending their top-flight membership after 14 successive seasons among the elite. Leading goalscorer: Thierry Henry (Arsenal) – 30 The top three led the division for most of the season, but Sunderland could not shake off their poor start and lost out to Norwich, who returned to the Premiership after nearly a decade, and West Brom, who bounced back to the Premiership after relegation the previous season. Crystal Palace achieved one of the most unlikely promotions of recent times, spending the entire first half of the season in the relegation zone under manager Steve Kember before surging into the play-off places under new manager Iain Dowie. Wimbledon's move to Milton Keynes took its toll on the club, and they finished bottom of the table in an abysmal final season for the club before it was renamed as MK Dons. Bradford fared little better, despite the presence of former England captain Bryan Robson in the manager's chair. Walsall made a respectable start to the season before slumping somewhat later on, and finally crashing into the relegation zone; just a single point from any of their last three games would have ensured survival. Millwall qualified for the UEFA Cup for finishing as runners-up in the FA Cup, as winners Manchester United already qualified for the Champions League. Leading goalscorer: Andrew Johnson (Crystal Palace) – 27 Plymouth Argyle finished top of the division, though they lost manager Paul Sturrock to Southampton. Queens Park Rangers grabbed the second spot from under the noses of Bristol City, who proceeded to lose the play-off final to Brighton & Hove Albion, another side who bounced back from relegation the previous season. Tony Adams, previously suggested by many as a possible future manager of Arsenal and England, failed to keep Wycombe Wanderers up, ending their ten-year spell in the division. Notts County nearly went bankrupt during the course of the season and the effect on the club was evident, as they slipped into Division Three (or League Two, as it would be called the next season). Rushden & Diamonds' years of success came to a grinding halt as they suffered their first-ever relegation and crashed out of the division after being promoted the previous year. Grimsby Town filled the final relegation spot, resulting in their second consecutive relegation; they had looked safe in the final weeks, but ultimately went down after a poor sequence of results combined with revivals by Chesterfield and Stockport county. Leading goalscorer: Leon Knight (Brighton & Hove Albion) and Stephen McPhee (Port Vale) – 25 Doncaster Rovers earned a second successive promotion, showing that the club was firmly back on track after the years of struggle and scandal that the club had endured in the late 90s. Hull City were another team who had suffered much strife in the previous decade, but this time their extensive investment in players finally paid off, and they were promoted as runners-up. Torquay United, traditionally strugglers, snatched the third automatic promotion spot from Huddersfield on the last day of the season. Huddersfield Town would make up for this by beating Mansfield in the play-off final, earning an immediate return after the previous year's relegation. York City were in play-off contention for a large part of the campaign, but a disastrous end to the season saw them lose 16 of their last 20 games, costing them their 80-year-old League status. Conversely, Carlisle United started the season horrendously, but a late run saw them finish 23rd. A few years ago this would have seen them complete an amazing escape from relegation, but with the introduction of two relegation places from the League it was no longer sufficient, and they dropped into the Conference, becoming the first former top-flight team to suffer this indignity. Leading goalscorer: Steve MacLean (Scunthorpe United) – 23  The summer transfer window ran from the end of the previous season until 31 August 2003.  The mid-season transfer window runs from 1 to 31 January 2004. For subsequent transfer deals see 2004-05 in English football.

Meanwhile, Wolverhampton Wanderers lost the first three games of their first top flight campaign for 20 years; Bolton Wanderers and Middlesbrough completed the bottom three.

Newcastle United were in eighth place just below Manchester City. West Bromwich Albion were top of Division One, where Wigan Athletic were playing for the first time in their history. Norwich City, Sheffield United, Sunderland and West Ham United completed the top six.

Leeds United, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Leicester City occupied the bottom three places. Norwich City and West Bromwich Albion were still leading the way at the top of Division One. Sheffield United, Sunderland, Ipswich Town and Wigan Athletic occupied the play-off zone. 2 February 2004: Tottenham Hotspur paid £7million for West Ham United striker Jermain Defoe. 29 February 2004: Middlesbrough won their first ever trophy as a professional club by beating Bolton Wanderers in the League Cup final.

They were also in contention for both the European Cup and the FA Cup. Liverpool and Newcastle United completed the top five as Charlton Athletic's bid for a European place was fading fast, the competition now coming from Birmingham City and Aston Villa. At the other end of the table, time was running out for Wolverhampton Wanderers and Leeds United; Leicester City were still giving the rest of the bottom 10 a good run for their money. Norwich City and West Bromwich Albion were equal on points at the top of Division One and Millwall had edged Wigan Athletic out of the top six. 10 April 2004: Arsenal's double hopes ended when they lost 1–0 to Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park. 25 April 2004: Arsenal clinched the Premier League title - and were still unbeaten - after a 2–2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. Norwich City and West Bromwich Albion had their promotion from Division One confirmed. The play-off places were still being contested between seven clubs: Sunderland, Ipswich Town, West Ham United, Wigan Athletic, Sheffield United, Reading and Crystal Palace, who had climbed from 19th to 7th since the appointment of Iain Dowie as manager four months previously. 30 April 2004: Arsenal finished April as Premier League champions while Chelsea and Manchester United fought closely for second place. Liverpool and Aston Villa completed the top five, though the seven teams below them still stood a chance of a top-five finish and European qualification. Wolverhampton Wanderers and Leicester City needed a miracle to avoid relegation and Leeds United were still giving most of the rest of the bottom 10 a run for their money. 1 May 2004: Leicester City's relegation from the Premier League was confirmed just one season after promotion; Wolverhampton Wanderers needed to win both of their remaining games by a huge margin and hope that Manchester City would suffer heavy defeats in both of theirs to survive, despite beating Everton.
