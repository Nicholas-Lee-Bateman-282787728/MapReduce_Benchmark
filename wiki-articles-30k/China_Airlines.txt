     China Airlines (CAL) () () is the flag carrier and largest airline of the Republic of China (Taiwan). It is headquartered in Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and has 12,080 regular employees. China Airlines operates over 1,400 flights weekly to 118 airports in 115 cities (including codeshare) across Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania. The cargo division operates 91 pure freighter flights weekly to 33 destinations. The carrier was, in 2013, the 29th and 10th largest airline in the world in terms of passenger revenue per kilometer (RPK) and freight RPK, respectively. China Airlines has three airline subsidiaries: Mandarin Airlines operates flights to domestic and low-demand regional destinations; China Airlines Cargo operates a fleet of freighter aircraft and manages its parent airline's cargo-hold capacity; Tigerair Taiwan is a low-cost carrier established by China Airlines and Singaporean airline group Tigerair Holdings. With a fleet of two PBY Amphibians, China Airlines was established on December 16, 1959, with its shares completely held by the Republic of China government. It was founded by a retired air force officer and initially concentrated on charter flights. During the 1960s, China Airlines was able to establish its first scheduled routes. In October 1962, a flight from Taipei to Hualien became the airline's first domestic service. Later, with the introduction of Caravelle and Boeing 727-100s,the airlines introduced international flights to South Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Japan. With the airlines' first two Boeing 707 aircraft, trans-Pacific flights to San Francisco via Tokyo were initiated on February 2, 1970. The expansion of the company's 707 fleet also permitted more services in Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and North America (via Japan and Hawaii).  Following the standard utilization of the wide-body 747 on the highly profitable Trans Pacific - USA routes, China Airlines introduced its first two 747-100s (ex-Delta Air Lines aircraft) in 1976 and immediately placed it on its Hong Kong-Taipei-Tokyo-Honolulu-Los Angeles route. Shortly thereafter, four brand new Boeing 747SP (Special Performance) were introduced in 1977. Due to political pressure, Japan ended its diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1972, and all flights between Taiwan and Japan were stopped. The 747SP aircraft made it possible for China Airlines to fly daily nonstop services from Taipei to its North American destinations without stopping over in Japan. It also allowed the airlines to introduce flights to Saudi Arabia and South Africa. In 1979, the airlines switched all operations from the small downtown Songshan International Airport to the newly built Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (current Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport). Following the introduction of 747-200s, the airlines introduced its first European destination, Amsterdam. In 1978, Japan allowed China Airlines to return to Tokyo International Airport at Haneda after relocating all other airlines at the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, leaving China Airlines as the sole international operator at Haneda, which at the time was an exclusive domestic facility. The premise being that air carriers from the PRC and Taiwan were prevented crossing paths at any Japanese airports. Thus CAL's Osaka service, due to the city's only airport at Itami, would not be reinstated until years later. Oddly enough, the crossing of flag-carriers (Taiwan based-airlines and Mainland China PRC based-airlines) occurred almost hourly at then British-controlled Hong Kong's Kaitak International Airport. Adversely, other regional airports such as Bangkok, Singapore and Manila were entirely spared of this indignity imposed on Japan by China. The next 20 years saw sporadic but far-reaching growth for the company.   Later, the airline inaugurated its own round-the-world flight: (Taipei-Anchorage-New York-Amsterdam-Dubai-Taipei). 1993 saw China Airlines listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Later CAL would place one of the largest orders for the newest Boeing 747. The new 747s and an earlier an order with Airbus for over a dozen A300B4 wide body regional jets allowed for addition destination growth.  As the flag carrier for the Republic of China, China Airlines has been affected by disputes over the political status of Taiwan, and under pressure from the   People's Republic of China was barred from flying into a number of countries maintaining diplomatic relations with the PRC. As a result, in the mid-1990s, China Airlines subsidiary Mandarin Airlines took over some of its Sydney and Vancouver international routes. Partly as a way to avoid the international controversy, in 1995 China Airlines unveiled its "plum blossom" logo, replacing the national flag, which had previously appeared on the tail fins (empennage), and the aircraft livery from the red-white-blue national colors on the fuselage of its aircraft.  Plum blossom (Prunus mume) is the National Flower of the Republic of China. Throughout the 1990s, the airline employed many ex-ROC Air Force pilots. Due to the company's poor safety record in the 1990s, China Airlines began to change its pilot recruitment practices and the company began to actively recruit civilian-trained pilots with proven track records.  In addition, the company began recruiting university graduates as trainees in its own pilot training program. The company also modified its maintenance and operational procedures. These decisions were instrumental in the company's improved safety record, culminating in the company's recognition by the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). During the 1990s and early 2000s, China Airlines placed orders for various airliners including the Airbus A330, Airbus A340, Boeing 737-800, and the Boeing 747-400 (Both the passenger and freighter version). Due to improving cross-strait relations, the first cross-strait charter flights between Taiwan and China were introduced in 2003, with China Airlines' flight 585, operated by a Boeing 747-400, being the first Taiwanese flight to legally land in China. (The aircraft took off from Taoyuan Airport, stopped over at Hong Kong Airport, and landed at Shanghai Pudong Airport.) In 2005, the first nonstop cross-strait charter flights were initiated, with China Airlines' flight 581 (Taoyuan Airport to Beijing Capital Airport) being the first flight of the program to depart from Taiwan. In 2008, the first regular weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China started operating, with daily charter flights introduced later in the year. In 2009, regularly scheduled cross-strait flights were finally introduced.  China Airlines signed an agreement to begin the process of joining the SkyTeam airline alliance on September 14, 2010 and officially became a full member on September 28, 2011. This was marked by an update to the logo of the airline and the typeface in which "China Airlines" is printed. The carrier was the first Taiwanese airline to join an airline alliance. In December 2013, China Airlines announced its new joint venture with Singaporean low cost carrier Tigerair Holdings to establish Tigerair Taiwan. The new airline flew its inaugural flight to Singapore on 26 September 2014 and became the first low-cost carrier in Taiwan. China Airlines Group currently holds a 90 percent share in the new carrier (China Airlines 80%, Mandarin Airlines 10%), while Tigerair Holdings holds the other 10 percent. In March 2014, China Airlines announced that it will be launching a "NexGen (Next Generation)" plan to complement the delivery of its first Boeing 777-300ER. The plan, designed to refresh the carrier's brand image, includes fleet replacements, product innovations, and new uniform introductions. Through cooperating with designers from the Greater China region, the carrier hopes to introduce unique product offerings that can showcase the beauty of the East and the cultural creativity of Taiwan. The first phase of the plan has been rolled out following the delivery of China Airlines' first Boeing 777-300ER and the renovation of the carrier's lounge at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Terminal 1. In June 2015, the William Chang-designed new uniforms debuted; in August 2015, the flight attendants started appearing in the new uniforms. Future phases of the plan includes the retirement of the Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A340-300, announcement of new narrow-body orders, and new cabin designs on the Airbus A350-900XWB. Following the retirement of 747s from North American routes, China Airlines has terminated its First Class services. First Class seats are now marketed as Business Class ones. In January 2015, China Airlines established Taiwan Aircraft Maintenance & Engineering Co. (TAMECO), an airline maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) company which will start operations in June 2017. TAMECO will focus on Boeing 777, 737 and Airbus A350, A320 fuselage maintenance.   China Airlines has its headquarters, CAL Park ("「華航園區新建工程」1月31日隆重舉行開工動土典禮2009年底完工 將成為台灣桃園國際機場地標." China Airlines.

Previously China Airlines had operations at its headquarters, facilities on the east side of Taipei Songshan Airport, and at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. The airline consolidated all of those functions in its new headquarters site. The airline will rent space in the six floors making up its former headquarters to tenants. The monthly rent will be $2,000 New Taiwan Dollars per ping. In September 2009 the airline estimated that it would make $7 million NTW in monthly rental income. Han Liang-zhong, a China Airlines vice president, said that the rental income would cover the bank loans that the airline borrowed to finance the construction of the CAL Park. As a result of the headquarters move, China Airlines will develop part of the training center at Taipei Songshan Airport into a business aviation center.Staff.

The carrier changed its livery due to political pressure from the Chinese government. The mainland government prohibited any aircraft flying with the Republic of China Flag displayed to land in the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau. It also pressured other countries to carry out similar bans. This forced China Airlines to change its corporate identity in order to avoid having operations affected. In 2011, after joining Skyteam, the carrier made alterations to its logo in hopes of refreshing its brand image. A new font was chosen for the company name and a new approach was taken for the appearance of the plum blossom trademark. China Airlines has had many uniforms since its establishment in 1959.  The current uniform was introduced in 2015 to celebrate the carrier entering a "NexGen" Next Generation Era. Designed by Hong Kong-based costume designer William Chang, the new uniforms are now worn by flight attendants. Ground staff will start wearing the uniforms in September 2015. China Airlines has used different slogans throughout its operational history. In 2006, the current slogan was introduced to complement the new uniforms and to celebrate the 47th anniversary. China Airlines' slogans have been as follows:   China Airlines currently operates over 1,400 flights weekly (including pure cargo flights) to 118 airports in 115 cities on four continents (excluding codeshare; brackets indicate future destinations). Japan is the most important market of the carrier, with over 180 flights weekly from multiple points in Taiwan to 14 Japanese destinations. China Airlines has its largest hub at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, which is the largest airport in Taiwan and is located near the national capital of Taipei. China Airlines operate out of both Terminal 1 and 2 at the airport. Operations to Europe, India, Korea, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia are located at Terminal 1 while those to China, Japan, North America and Oceania are located at Terminal 2. Additionally, China Airlines and its domestic subsidiary Mandarin Airlines operate numerous flights out of Kaohsiung International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. International flights from Songshan Airport to three Northeast Asian downtown airports, namely Tokyo-Haneda, Seoul-Gimpo and Shanghai-Hongqiao, have important significance to the carrier as the routes form a Northeast Asia Golden Flight Circle. The expansion of China Airlines international presence has long been limited by the political status of Taiwan. Currently, the carrier is still unable to offer flights to destinations such as Paris. Flights to Mainland China were also not permitted until 2003, when the carrier's Chinese New Year charter flight 585 from Taipei-Taoyuan to Shanghai-Pudong via Hong Kong made China Airlines the first Taiwanese carrier to legally land in China and the first carrier to legally fly between the two areas. The carrier operated occasional cross-strait charter flights for another few years until 2008, when regular charters flights started. In 2009, a new air service agreement allowed China Airlines to start regularly scheduled flights to the Mainland. Since then, China has quickly become the second largest market for China Airlines, with over 130 flights to 33 destinations across the Mainland. Over the period between 2011 and 2015, China Airlines focused on strengthening its regional network; from 2015 to 2020, the carrier will start expanding its European, North American and Oceanian network with the new long-haul fleet. The carrier is considering launching Seattle, London, Milan, and a Spanish destination, either Madrid or Barcelona. Other long-haul network plans include upgrading aircraft types and altering routings. China Airlines has replaced the Boeing 747-400 with Boeing 777 on all passenger flights to Frankfurt, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco. In the future, all European destinations (excluding Frankfurt) will be flown nonstop with the Airbus A350 XWB, affecting the existing Amsterdam services via Bangkok and Rome services via Delhi. Services to Oceania and Hawaii are also likely to be flown by the A350. China Airlines is evaluating a new Canadian destination, which will likely be Calgary or Toronto. It is also planning on starting regular flights to cities, including Niigata, Niigata and Hanamaki, Iwate, in the Tohoku region. Cross-strait flight distributions are also important to the company. Flight rights to Jieyang and Yangzhou have been granted to China Airlines by the civil aviation administration of Taiwan in 2015. The carrier is considering increasing the frequencies of its North American, Beijing and Shanghai routes utilizing the Boeing 747-400 fleet, which may be having its retirement plan postponed due to falling oil prices. China Airlines has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:   In addition, China Airlines has a codeshare agreement with Deutsche Bahn (DB). Under the agreement, China Airlines places its CI code on seven Frankfurt-initiating DB routes, including those to Cologne, Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich, Nuremberg, and Stuttgart China Airlines owns and leases a total of 91 aircraft with an average age of 10 years (). Of the fleet, 82 are in service while 9 are stored. In 2008, China Airlines firmed up an order for 14 Airbus A350-900 aircraft along with another 6 options. In 2012, an order for 6 Boeing 777-300ER and a lease agreement with GECAS for 4 more of the type were confirmed. Both the Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 777-300ER will be replacements of the carrier's Airbus A340-300 and Boeing 747-400 on intercontinental routes. Deliveries of the Airbus A350-900 will start in July 2016 while those for the Boeing 777-300ER started in 2014. Regarding the narrow-body fleet, in January 2015, the airline's president Sun Hung-Hsiang announced that the airline is planning on ordering 50 narrow-body aircraft for itself and its subsidiaries Mandarin Airlines and Tigerair Taiwan. Types in consideration includes the Boeing 737MAX and Airbus A320neo. However, due to drastic market changes, Sun announced in October 2015 that the type and size of the new narrow-body fleet will be reconsidered. The new order will be announced as early as 2016. The airline has been leasing various Airbus A330-300s and Boeing 737-800s to meet short term demands. Of the wet-leased planes, one 737 has been dry-leased to subsidiary Mandarin Airlines and is wearing a hybrid livery, with the Mandarin Airlines livery on the fuselage and the China Airlines livery on the winglets. One more 737 will be leased to Mandarin Airlines in 2016. In June 2014, China Airlines announced plans to retire all of its Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A340-300. Since December 2014, the company has stored four Boeing 747-400, namely N168CL, B-18201, B-18202, and B-18251, at an aircraft boneyard at Victorville Airport. As for the A340 fleet, two aircraft, in particular B-18801 and B-18802, were sent to Victorville for storage in 2015. All stored passenger aircraft are to be sold eventually. The carrier will complete the sale of 2 Boeing 747-400 and 1 Airbus A340-300 during Q3 2015. However, due to falling oil prices, the carrier has updated the plans and decided to only retire the 747s produced before 1998. The 4 newer 747s (delivered between 2004 and 2005) will be kept to operate flights to slot-restricted high demand airports, such as those of Beijing and Shanghai as well as seasonal flights between December and February to Auckland via Brisbane.. As for subsidiary Mandarin Airlines, China Airlines announced that two ERJ190s will be retired and replaced by two new Boeing 737-800s. China Airlines Cargo is the freight division of China Airlines. It operates a fleet of 18 freighters to 33 destinations across Asia, Europe and North America, in addition to utilising the cargo space on passenger aircraft. Over the past few years, it has been suffering from falling freight demands and has stored 3 Boeing 747-400Fs at Victorville Airport. In early 2015, due to improving global economic conditions, the carrier decided to reactivate 1 stored freighter plane. However, as demand has once again decreased, the plan has been put on hold. The first China Airlines special livery, the "Taiwan Touch Your Heart" tourism-promotional livery, was introduced in 2003. The project was a collaboration between the carrier and the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan. However, the plane was painted back to the normal livery before it left the hangar. Currently, China Airlines has a total of 5 special livery aircraft in service. In 2013, China Airlines revealed plans to paint up to 20 Taiwan-themed special livery aircraft. The carrier will collaborate with Taiwanese artists, cultural workers, and tourism bureaus to design the special liveries.

Houston Chronicle. January 11, 2008. Retrieved on November 20, 2012. China Airlines launched more methods to check in for flights. Among them were self-check in utilizing a kiosk at Taoyuan Airport and other selected destinations. China Airlines also offers check-in via mobile phone. Passengers can use the "CI Mobile" application to check flight arrivals and departures and check in for their flights. China Airlines Cargo, the cargo division of the airline, was the first airline operating out of Taipei to fully switch to e-air waybill, a method that eliminates the need for all paper documents when issuing air waybills, and one of the nine countries/territories and airlines (include both the airline and Taiwan) selected by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to run the e-AWB pilot programme. The airline also allows customers to track freight and flights on their smartphones through the "CAL Cargo" application.  China Airlines has diversified into related industries and sectors, including ground handling, aviation engineering, inflight catering. Companies with major China Airlines Group stake include: Between 1994 and 2002, China Airlines suffered 4 fatal accidents, 3 of which each resulted in over 200 deaths. The accidents contributed to the airline having a poor reputation for safety, partly blamed on an air force-influenced pilot culture. Since then, the airline's safety record has seen an improvement.

The ROC government sent a delegation to discuss with their mainland counterpart regards the return of the plane and 2 remaining crew. On 26 October 1989, Flight 204, a Boeing 737-200, struck a mountain near Hualien, Taiwan after the crew used the climbout procedure of the incorrect runway, causing the aircraft to make a wrong turn.

On 4 November 1993, Flight 605, a brand new Boeing 747-400, overran the Kai Tak Airport runway 13 while landing during a typhoon. It had touched down more than 2/3 down the runway and was unable to stop before the end of the runway, finishing up in Hong Kong harbor.

All 206 passengers and 19 crew members died. The aircraft was the last 747-200 in China Airlines' passenger fleet. The cause was improper repair after a tailstrike incident in Hong Kong in 1980. On 20 August 2007, Flight 120, a Boeing 737-800 inbound from Taipei caught fire shortly after landing at Naha Airport in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. After stopping on the tarmac, the engine started smoking and burning, and later exploded causing the aircraft to catch fire. A statement from the airline confirmed that all passengers and crew members were safely evacuated, and a ground engineer knocked off his feet by the blast was unhurt. The cause of the explosion has been attributed to a fuel leak caused by a bolt from the right wing slat puncturing the fuel tank.
