Most major transportation companies have a facility in Laredo. The city's location on the southern end of I-35 close to the manufacturers in northern Mexico promotes its vital role in trade between the two nations. Laredo International Airport is within the Laredo city limits, while the Quetzalcoatl International Airport is nearby in Nuevo Laredo on the Mexican side. Laredo has the distinction of flying seven flags (the Flag of the Republic of the Rio Grande in addition to the Six Flags of Texas).

The Jalapeño Festival, Border Beer Fest, Stockmen's Ball, Princess Pocahontas Pageant, Mr. South Texas Luncheon, an air show, and two major parades are all held in conjunction with the Washington's birthday events.     The European colonial settlement of Villa de San Agustin de Laredo was founded in 1755 by Don Tomás Sánchez while the area was part of the Nuevo Santander region in the Spanish colony of New Spain. Villa de San Agustin de Laredo was named after Laredo, Cantabria, Spain and in honor of Saint Augustine of Hippo. In 1840, Laredo was the capital of the independent Republic of the Rio Grande, set up in opposition to Antonio López de Santa Anna; it was brought back into Mexico by military force. In 1846 during the Mexican-American War, the town was occupied by the Texas Rangers. After the war, the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo ceded the land to the United States. A referendum was taken in the town, which voted to petition the American military government in charge of the area to return the town to Mexico. When this petition was rejected, most of the population, who were Tejano and had been in the area for generations, moved across the river into Mexican territory, where they founded Nuevo Laredo. In 1849, the United States Army set up Fort McIntosh (originally Camp Crawford). Laredo was rechartered as a city in 1852. Laredo is one of the oldest crossing points along the U.S.-Mexico border, and the nation's largest inland port of entry. In 2005, Laredo celebrated the 250th anniversary of its founding. The origin of name of the original Spanish town of Laredo is unclear. Some scholars say the name stems from Glaretum which means "sandy, rocky place". Others state that Laredo stems from a Basque word meaning "beautiful pastures".Laredo OriginLaredo Origin Laredo might also stem from the latin Larida which means gull. In 1954, Laredo faced a devastating Rio Grande flood, when the water reached 61.35 feet, more than 10 feet higher than in the previous 1932 flood, which had also caused great damage. According to Laredo historian Jerry D. Thompson of Texas A&M International University, the 1954 flood was "the largest in ninety-one years and the second largest according to archeological records in the last three hundred years." Many were left homeless for a time because of the calamity. Former Webb County administrative Judge Mercurio Martinez, Jr., recalls that his father surveyed the depth of the water and advised residents to evacuate. Several downtown businesses had to remove their merchandise inventory or risk losing it to the rising waters. The flood caused the relocation of the Holding Institute. The international bridge was destroyed when it was struck by the floating railroad bridge, which had been hit by the debris of another bridge in Eagle Pass up the river.  Photos of the flood by Teofilo Esquivel, Sr., are on the wall of a Danny's Restaurant on McPherson Avenue in Laredo.Gabriela A. Trevino, "Flood of 1954: Devastating natural disaster caused serious damage," Laredo Morning Times, June 28, 2015, pp. 1, 18A In 2013, Laredo ranked tenth in Texas in the rate of violent crime, with 430.9 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. Highest in ranking was Odessa, with 806.4 violent crimes per unit. The second most "dangerous city" was also in West Texas; Lubbock had 658 crimes per 100,000 persons. The other border cities of El Paso, McAllen, and Brownsville ranked 13th, 18th, and 24th, respectively. The city with the highest murder rate in Texas was Beaumont-Port Arthur, with a rating of 8.6, compared to Laredo's 1.5."Most Dangerous Cities in Texas", Laredo Morning Times, January 25, 2015, p. 6A According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 79.6&nbsp;square miles (206.0&nbsp;km²), of which, 78.5&nbsp;square miles (203.2&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 1.1&nbsp;square miles (2.8&nbsp;km²) of it (1.37%) is water. Laredo is located on the west end of the Rio Grande Plains, south of the Edwards Plateau, west of the Coastal Plains, and east of the Mexican Mountains.  The area consists of a few hills and flat land covered with grass, oak, and mesquite. Notable geographic features are the Rio Grande and Chacon Creek's man-made reservoir, Lake Casa Blanca, in Lake Casa Blanca International State Park. The lake is  of land and  of water. There are six major creeks Chacon Creek, San Ildefonso Creek, San Ygnacio Creek, Santa Isabel Creek, Sombrerillito Creek, and Zacate Creek, all of which drain into the Rio Grande. Several man-made reservoirs include the San Ildefonso Creek Lake (second largest reservoir), and the Sombrerillito Creek Lake (third largest reservoir). Laredo's climate is semi-arid with hot temperatures in the summer and mild temperatures during the winter. The climate is considered to be hot semi-arid (Köppen: BSh). Its weather is affected by the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains to the west, the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Chihuahuan Desert of Northern Mexico and West Texas. Moisture from the Pacific is cut off by the Mexican mountain range. Because of its geographic location, Laredo's weather can range from long periods of heat to sudden, violent storms in a short period of time.  Laredo winters are cold by south Texas standards: with average daytime highs of approximately 66&nbsp;°F (19&nbsp;C) and average overnight lows of 43&nbsp;°F (6&nbsp;C).  Although snowfall is rare in Laredo, snow was recorded on Christmas morning 2004 and in February 2011.

According to the United States Census Bureau, at a 2000 census, Laredo was the second fastest growing city in the United States, after (Las Vegas, Nevada). A study released in 2015 by the Martin Prosperity Institute of the University of Toronto in Canada showed Laredo as the most "economically segregated" smaller metro area in the United States. The wealthy tend to congregate in enclaves and gated communities, such as Plantation, Regency, Lakeside, Winfield, and Alexander Estates. Most of the poor inhabit neighborhoods known for overall and longstanding poverty, particularly in the southern portion of the city. Mayor Pete Saenz, however, said development is underway downtown and in The Heights neighborhood, once the city's most affluent residential area. There are no de facto Anglo and African-American neighborhoods. The second and third cities cited in the study are Jackson, Tennessee, and El Paso, Texas.Gabriela A. Treviño, "No. 1 rankjing: Laredo's wealthy are most segregated", Laredo Morning Times, April 20, 2015, pp. 1, 17A Laredo has four South Texas banking institutions based in the city: Falcon International Bank, International Bank of Commerce, BBVA Compass, and Texas Community Bank. Laredo is the largest inland port in the United States, and Nuevo Laredo the largest in Latin America. This is due to their respective locations, served by Interstate Highway 35 / Mexican Federal Highway 85, the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), dozens of twin assembly plants on the Mexican side, and dozens of import export agencies to expedite trade. In January 2014, the Laredo customs district processed "$20 billion in two-way trade with Mexico," about half that for the entire US with Mexico for the month. Laredo is a shopping destination for Mexican shoppers from Northern Mexico. In 2015 the San Antonio Express-News reported that the number of Mexican shoppers has declined due to drug war-related violence in Nuevo Laredo.  More than 47 percent of United States international trade headed for Mexico and more than 36 percent of Mexican international trade crosses through the Laredo port of entry."National report lists Laredo as largest inland port", Laredo Morning Times Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas "Southwest Economy " Laredo's economy revolves around commercial and industrial warehousing, import, and export. As a major player in international trade, the Laredo area benefited from passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has encouraged trade. The Laredo port of entry consists of four international bridges (with a proposed fifth one) crossing the Rio Grande into the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon. Retail sales attract shoppers from Northern Mexico and South Texas.Shopping Demographics in the Laredo Area There is one indoor shopping mall located in Laredo, Mall del Norte. A proposed project is The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo, and another has not progressed past planning: Laredo Town Center, part of downtown redevelopment. There are dozens of shopping centers. The Streets of Laredo Urban Mall is an association created by businesses on Iturbide Street in the San Agustin historical district to beautify and renovate the area, which has a pedestrian scale.LareDOS Article "Streets of Laredo Urban Mall As of October 2007, Laredo's labor market was in the following industries by percentage of number employed: Trade, Transportation, and Utilities (32%), Information (1%), Financial Activity (5%), Professional and Business Services (6%), Education and Health Services (15%), Leisure and Hospitality (10%), Government (23%), Mining and Construction (5%), Manufacturing (2%), and Other Services (2%). Laredo has increased the number of non-agricultural jobs from 55,100 in January 1996 to 86,600 in October 2007. Laredo has had a higher job growth rate (2%-6.5%) than the state as a whole because of expanded international trade through the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 2007, Laredo experienced a job growth rate of 2.5%. As of October 2007, the Laredo unemployment rate was 4.1% or 3,700 unemployed persons, as compared to 3.9% in Texas statewide. This is a significant drop since the mid-1990s, when Laredo's unemployment was over 15%. Laredo has had positive job market growth since the mid-1990s; setbacks in the mining (oil/gas) industry shifted a few thousand workers to other industries such as international trade and construction. Many large employers in the oil and gas industries shut down operations in Laredo and across Texas, and shifted to foreign countries. The same effect occurred in the garment industry (Levis and Haggar) along the Texas border area. Laredo lost its only garment-producing company (Barry), costing the jobs of about 300 workers.  Laredo's strong job growth rate in retail and transportation services limited the adverse effects of long-term unemployment from the few massive layoffs of the late 1990s. Laredo's success with international trade is also a vulnerability; it is dependent on changes to Mexico's economy, that status of immigration laws (along with daily border crossings: shoppers and commercial trade), and terrorism.Laredo Labor Market, South Texas Workforce Commission In 2014, according to the financial research company NerdWallet, Laredo had the worst pay for women of any city in the United States, with a large gender gap: an average annual salary of $24,700 for women, compared to nearly $35,000 for men. The gender pay gap in Laredo increased 25 percent between 2007 and 2012. Only the wealthy city of Frisco in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, had a greater pay gap within Texas than did Laredo. According to census reports, Laredo has a 30 percent rate of poverty. Laredo households headed by women with children under the age of eighteen have a 51 percent poverty rate.Aldo Amato, "Gender: Pay gap called large, Laredo Morning Times, April 1, 2014, p. 1 By contrast, the San Jose, California, area, the heart of the tech industry, has an average pay of $56,000, ranking first nationally.Matthew Nelson, "Financial Research: Laredo ranked worst in pay", Laredo Morning Times, February 6, 2014, p. 1 The Washington's Birthday Celebration (WBCA)Washington's Birthday Celebration Association Home Page is a month-long event that celebrates George Washington's Birthday.

Relatively new to Laredoans, this mountain bike trail is approximately 4 miles of single-track dirt trails, widening occasionally to double-track.

The trail is located off Shiloh Road at the end of Livingston Road. Laredo and Webb County are overwhelmingly Democratic in political complexion, but voter turnout is often below average, rarely even half of the number of registered voters. Even in weak Democratic years, Webb County voters remain party loyalists. Republicans rarely even offer candidates for county offices. Webb County Republican chairman Randy S. Blair of Laredo said that his party attracts its voters from competitive races for state and national office: "It takes more people coming out to vote to give the candidates an opportunity here. ... [Texas] is still a red state, and I think we'll hold a lot of offices statewide and bounce back in the next election."Aldo Amato, "Webb County: Candidates file for election", Laredo Morning Times, December 11, 2013, p. 1, 11A More than fifty Democratic candidates from Webb County contested county, state, and national office in the primary election held on March 4, 2014. No Webb County Republicans filed for office, but Republican primary contests are competitive within Webb County for such races as governor, lieutenant governor, U.S. senator, and agriculture commissioner. A wave of public corruption swept through Laredo and Webb County in 2014, as six officials  were arrested in a seven-month period for an assortment of charges. Webb County Precinct 1 Commissioner Mike Montemayor was indicted in March for bribery; he pleaded guilty in June to the charge and awaits sentencing. In May, Rio Bravo Mayor Manuel Vela was charged with gambling and money laundering by the Webb County Sheriff's Office. On August 1, Laredo City Council member Jorge Vera was indicted after being arrested by Laredo police on cocaine possession and filing a false police report. In September 2014, Precinct 2, Place 2 Justice of the Peace Ricardo Rangel pleaded guilty on an extortion charge, was suspended without pay by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, and finally resigned the position in humiliation. He was sentenced in August 2015 to thirty-seven months in prison and fined $5,000. Juan Enrique Rodriguez, the bail bondsman who offered the bribe, received thirteen months and a $15,000 fine. In October, Laredo Independent School District trustee Johnny Amaya was indicted for having tampered with government records and engaging in organized crime in connection with his previous position as the Webb County water utilities manager. On October 12, city council member Alex Perez was arrested by Laredo police on a theft charge for having allegedly stolen a political advertising sign of his opponent in the November 4 municipal election.Aldo Amato, "Corruption runs deep: Six officials in Webb, Laredo arrested in past seven months", Laredo Morning Times, October 19, 2014, pp. 1, 16A Historian Jerry D. Thompson, based at Texas A&M International University, interviewed by the Laredo Morning Times in October 2014, called the wave of corrupt practices:  so petty you wonder why it happens. It's just chronic, and it's going to take some vigilance by the state and federal authorities to stop it. The political machine that ran Laredo for years is still alive ... Corruption is a way of life in Webb County government. I think the problem is the cream of the crop is not rising to the surface any more. It's partly the electorate's fault. We need to elect the right people. ... Corruption seems to happen more often than not in areas of great poverty. Those who do not have great wealth seem to be at the center of several corruption scandals. Southern Methodist University political scientist Cal Jillson, author of Texas Politics: Governing the Lone Star State, blamed the influence of Mexico in regard to the spillover of corrupt practices into Laredo. Like Thompson, Jillson called the 2014 corruption "small time". Unlike Thompson, Jillson believes that the corruption is not particularly related to poverty on the border. Corruption, he notes, also occurs in affluent areas, such as Dallas County. "What we've seen in Webb County is not distinctive, and you can find it no matter where you go in Texas. It's one of the biggest problems facing our state," Jillson concluded. Corruption is not confined to elected officeholders. On July 2, 2015, Jesus Javier Garcia, Jr., accepted a plea bargain in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in which he admitted to have collected through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection more than $40,000 in pay for work that he did not perform. He manually manipulated his work schedule to procure illegally compensation for days not worked and overtime hours as well.Phillip Balli, "CBP officer pleads guilty: Wrongfully collecting pay when not workingm Laredo Morning Times, July 11, 2015, pp. 1, 7A The Laredo city government is a strong city council – weak mayor system. The mayor presides over the eight-member city council, but he/she may only vote to break a tie. City Council elections are based on single-member districts and campaigns have no party affiliations. Municipal elections are now held in November (formerly in May) of even-numbered years. The municipal government is administered by the city manager hired by the city council. All city elected offices have a four-year term and are nonpartisan though most officials have a Democratic party preference or affiliation. City council meetings are held on Mondays and can be viewed on the Public-access television cable TV channel or live online at Public Access Channel live stream. The current mayor, Pete Saenz, was elected in 2014 to succeed his fellow Democrat, the term-limited Raul G. Salinas. In his bid for a second term, Salinas had in 2010 defeated then city council members Jose A. Valdez, Jr., and Gene Belmares.City of Laredo Government Salinas also failed in a bid to unseat Webb County treasurer Delia Perales in the Democratic runoff election held on May 27, 2014. The city manager, Jesus R. "Chuy" Olivares (born c. 1959), appointed by the eight-member city council in 2015, replaced the retiring Carlos Villarreal. Olivares is paid just over $249,000 annually, which includes a car and telephone allowance. He is a former city manager of Eagle Pass in Maverick County.Kendra Ablaza, "City manager contract approved: Olivares will receive $250k plus benefits, Laredo Morning Times, April 22, 2015, p. 1 City council members receive a monthly gross salary of $1,000 plus $750 monthly for maintaining a home office, $150 per month for a city cell phone, and $750 monthly for fuel expenses. The annual total compensation is hence $31,800.Laredo Morning Times, August 1, 2013, p. 4A On August 1, 2014, then city councilman Jorge A. Vera was arrested on a felony drug possession charge. He is accused of having earlier in the week offered cocaine to an off-duty agent of the United States Border Patrol and her friends outside a Laredo restaurant. First elected to the council in 2012, Vera faces a state jail felony (possession of a controlled substance) and a Class B misdemeanor (filing a false report).Aldo Amato and Cesar G. Rodriguez, "Councilman Vera busted: Faces felony drug possession charges", Laredo Morning Times, August 2, 2014, pp. 1, 9A Vera was subsequently indicted on both charges by a grand jury of the Texas 406th Judicial District Court. His arraignment was in the 49th District Court. Because Vera did not resign from the city council, a recall election was held on November 4, 2014.Aldo Amato, "Jury Indicts Vera: Drug possession, filing false report". Laredo Morning Times, August 22, 2014, pp. 1, 11A By a wide margin, voters in District VII supported Vera's recall. Attorney George Altgelt won the special election to succeed Vera. On April 30, 2015, the City of Laredo officially banned complimentary plastic bags for the use of customers in retail establishments. Some seven weeks later, the city produced evidence that the "beneficial measure is helping beautify the city". Photographs released by the municipal environmental services department showed several areas nearly free of litter, whereas there had been large amounts of debris in those locations prior to implementation of the ban. Though many residents had opposed the ban, the city predict that the law will be supported once the decline in litter becomes apparent.Malena Charur, "Plastic Bag Reduction Ordinance: Signs of Improvement: 'Beneficial measure is helping beauify the city'", Laredo Morning Times, June 17, 2015, pp. 1, 12A On June 29, 2015, Judge Beckie Palomo of the Texas 341st District Court rejected a suit against the ban on plastic bags filed by the Laredo Merchants Association.
