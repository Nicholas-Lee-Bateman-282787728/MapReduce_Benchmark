  European Americans (also known as Euro-Americans) are Americans with ancestry from Europe. The Spanish were the first Europeans to establish a continuous presence in what is now the United States. Martín de Argüelles born 1566, St. Augustine, Spanish Florida, was the first known person of European descent born in what is now the United States. Twenty-one years later, Virginia Dare, born in 1587 on Roanoke Island in present-day North Carolina, was the first child born in the Thirteen Colonies to English parents. In the 2013 American Community Survey, German Americans (14.6%), Irish Americans (10.5%), English Americans (7.7%) and Italian Americans (5.4%) were the four largest self-reported European ancestry groups in the United States forming 38.2% of the total population. However, the English-Americans and British-Americans demography is considered a serious under-count as the stock tend to self-report and identify as simply 'Americans' due to the length of time they have inhabited America.Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America By Dominic J. Pulera.Reynolds Farley, 'The New Census Question about Ancestry: What Did It Tell Us?', Demography, Vol. 28, No. 3 (August 1991), pp. 414, 421.Stanley Lieberson and Lawrence Santi, 'The Use of Nativity Data to Estimate Ethnic Characteristics and Patterns', Social Science Research, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1985), pp. 44-6.Stanley Lieberson and Mary C. Waters, 'Ethnic Groups in Flux: The Changing Ethnic Responses of American Whites', Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 487, No. 79 (September 1986), pp. 82-86. European Americans are not recognized as a group by the United States Census Bureau on their own, but are included in the category of "White". "White" is defined by the United States Census Bureau as "a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa". According to the US Census, European Americans are merely a subset of white Americans, as the census still includes Latinos (many of whom are of European descent) in the "white" category among other non-European whites. The term "non-Hispanic white" is often used as a proxy for European Americans, although that also includes a small fraction of peoples of Middle Eastern descent. In one study of self-classified European Americans, seventy percent, on average, had absolutely no African ancestry. The other thirty percent usually had just one African ancestor, amounting to an average of 0.7% African DNA for all European Americans. In 1995, as part of a review of the Office of Management and Budget's Statistical Policy Directive No. 15 (Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting), a survey was conducted of census recipients to determine their preferred terminology for the racial/ethnic groups defined in the Directive. For the 'white' group, 'European American' came third, preferred by 2.35% of panel interviewees. The term "European American" is not in popular use in the U.S. among the general public or in the mass media, and the terms "white" or "white American" are commonly used instead. The term is used interchangeably with "Caucasian American", "White American", and "Anglo American" in many places around the United States. "Anglo American" derives from the English speaking British colonists descended from the Angles tribes but refers to all English speaking White Americans/ While, European descended Americans (White Latinos) who have ancestors that spoke Spanish. It is used in the southwestern United States in place of "White" or "European American". European American also has a more specific reference than either "White American" or "Caucasian American" since both of these terms include a larger group of people than what is acknowledged in Europe.Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster See original definition (definition #1) of Anglo in English: It is defined as a synonym for Anglo-American--Page 86 Also, whereas the terms "White American" and "Caucasian American" carry somewhat ambiguous definitions, depending on the speaker, European American has a more specific definition and scope. According to linguist Janet Bing, the term "European American" has increased a little in use, especially among scholars. The term is used by some to emphasize the European cultural and geographical ancestral origins of Americans, in the same way as is done for African Americans and Asian Americans. A European American awareness is still notable because 90% of the respondents classified as white in the U.S. Census knew their European ancestry. Historically, the concept of an American originated in the U.S. as a person of European ancestry, thus excluding African Americans and Native Americans.Crevecoeur, Hector St. John. Letters from an American Farmer. "What is an American." 1782. As a linguistic concern, the term is often meant to discourage a dichotomous view of the racial landscape between the normative white category and everyone else. Margo Adair suggests that the recognition of specific European American ancestries allows certain Americans to become aware that they come from a variety of different cultures. Since 1607, some 57 million immigrants have come to the United States from other lands. Approximately 10 million passed through on their way to some other place or returned to their original homelands, leaving a net gain of some 47 million people. Prior to 1960, the overwhelming majority came from Europe or European descent from Canada. In 1960 for example, 75.0% of foreign-born population in the U.S came from the region of Europe. Before 1881, the vast majority of immigrants, almost 86% of the total, arrived from northwest Europe, principally Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia. The years between 1881 and 1893 the pattern shifted, in the sources of U.S. “New immigration”.  Between 1894 and 1914, immigrants from southern, central, and eastern Europe accounted for 69% of the total.The source: a guidebook to American genealogy. By Loretto Dennis Szucs, Sandra Hargreaves Luebking Colonial stock, which mostly consists of people of English, Scottish, Scots-Irish or Welsh descent, may be found throughout the country but is especially dominant in New England and the South. Some people of colonial stock, especially in the Mid-Atlantic states, are also of Dutch, German and Flemish descent. The vast majority of these are Protestants. The Pennsylvania Dutch (German American) population gave the state of Pennsylvania a high German cultural character. French descent, which can also be found throughout the country, is most concentrated in Louisiana, while Spanish descent is dominant in the Southwest and Florida. These are primarily Roman Catholic and were assimilated with the Louisiana Purchase and the aftermath of the Mexican–American War and Adams–Onís Treaty, respectively. The first large wave of European migration after the Revolutionary War came from Northern and Central-Western Europe between about 1820 and 1890. Most of these immigrants were from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and Britain, and with large numbers of Irish and German Catholics immigrating, Roman Catholicism became an important minority religion. Polish Americans usually used to come as German or Austrian citizens, since Poland lost its independence in the period between 1772–1795. Descendants of the first wave are dominant in the Midwest and West, although German descent is extremely common in Pennsylvania, and Irish descent is also common in urban centers in the Northeast. The Irish and Germans held onto their ethnic identity throughout the 19th and early half of the 20th centuries, as well of other European ethnic groups. Most people of Polish origin live in the Northeast and the Midwest (See also White ethnic). The second wave of European Americans arrived from the mid-1890s to the 1920s, mainly from Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Ireland. This wave included Irish, Italians, Greeks, Hungarians, Portuguese, Ukrainians, Russians, Poles and other Slavs. With large numbers of immigrants from Spain, Mexico, Spanish Caribbean, and South and Central America, White Hispanics have increased to 8% of the US population, and Texas, California, New York, and Florida are important centers for them.       At the 2010 Census there were 223,553,265 "White Americans", which includes 26.7 million White Hispanic and Latino Americans. That is, there are 196.8 million "Non-Hispanic Whites" (63.7% of the total population) and 26,735,713 White Hispanic and Latino Americans (8.7% of the population).  Non-Hispanic Whites together with White Hispanic and Latino Americans form the census category of "White Americans" - see Race and ethnicity. The numbers below give numbers of European Americans as measured by the U.S. Census in 1980, 1990, and 2000. The numbers are measured according to declarations in census responses. This leads to uncertainty over the real meaning of the figures: For instance, as can be seen, according to these figures, the European American population dropped 40 million in ten years, but in fact this is a reflection of changing census responses. In particular, it reflects the increased popularity of the 'American' option following its inclusion as an example in the 2000 census forms. It is important to note that breakdowns of the European American population into sub-components is a difficult and rather arbitrary exercise. Farley (1991) argues that "because of ethnic intermarriage, the numerous generations that separate respondents from their forbears and the apparent unimportance to many whites of European origin, responses appear quite inconsistent". In particular, a large majority of European Americans have ancestry from a number of different countries and the response to a single 'ancestry' gives little indication of the backgrounds of Americans today. When only prompted for a single response, the examples given on the census forms and a pride in identifying the more distinctive parts of one's heritage are important factors; these will likely adversely affect the numbers reporting ancestries from the British Isles. Multiple response ancestry data often greatly increase the numbers reporting for the main ancestry groups, although Farley goes as far to conclude that "no simple question will distinguish those who identify strongly with a specific European group from those who report symbolic or imagined ethnicity." He highlights responses in the Current Population Survey (1973) where for the main 'old' ancestry groups (e.g., German, Irish, English, and French), over 40% change their reported ancestry over the six-month period between survey waves (page 422).  An important example to note is that in 1980 23.75 million Americans claimed English ancestry and 25.85 claimed English ancestry together with one or more other. This represents 49.6 million people. The table below shows that in 1990 when only single and primary responses were allowed this fell to 32 million and in 2000 to 24 million.World Culture Encyclopedia EveryCulture.com The largest self-reported ancestries in 2000, reporting over 5 million members, were in order: German, Irish, English, American, Italian, French, and Polish. They have different distributions within the United States; in general, the northern half of the United States from Pennsylvania westward is dominated by German ancestry, and the southern half by English and American. Irish may be found throughout the entire country. Italian ancestry is most common in the Northeast, Polish in the Great Lakes Region, and French in New England and Louisiana.  U.S. Census Bureau statisticians estimate that approximately 62 percent of European Americans today are either wholly or partly of English, Welsh, Irish, or Scottish ancestry.  Approximately 86% of European Americans today are of northwestern and central European ancestry, and 14% are of southeastern European and White Hispanic and Latino American descent. For the most part European American cultural lineage can be traced back to Western and Northern Europe and is institutionalized in the government, traditions, and civic education in the U.S.Kirk, Russell. The Heritage Lecture Series. "America Should Strengthen its European Cultural Roots." Washington D.C:1949  The Solutrean hypothesis suggested that Europeans may have been among the first in the Americas.Earliest humans in the Americas: new evidence from Mexico, Journal of Human Evolution 44, 379-387. More recent research has argued this not to be the case and that the founding Native American population came from Siberia through Beringia. An article in the American Journal of Human Genetics states "Here we show, by using 86 complete mitochondrial genomes, that all Native American haplogroups, including haplogroup X, were part of a single founding population, thereby refuting multiple-migration models." Since most later European Americans have assimilated into American culture, most European Americans now generally express their individual ethnic ties sporadically and symbolically and do not consider their specific ethnic origins to be essential to their identity; however, European American ethnic expression has been revived since the 1960s. Southern Europeans, specifically Italian and Greeks (see Greek American), have maintained high levels of ethnic identity. Same applied to Polish Americans. In the 1960s, Mexican Americans, Jewish Americans, and African Americans started exploring their cultural traditions as the ideal of cultural pluralism took hold.  European Americans followed suit by exploring their individual cultural origins and having less shame of expressing their unique cultural heritage. Much of American culture also shows influences from English culture. Icons are cultural symbols. American icons project who they are and what they believe as Americans. Icons can be persons, places, or objects that have been mythologized. American icons capture the American imagination. The American legal system also has its roots in French philosophy with the separation of powers and the federal systemSeparation of powers#Checks and balances along with English law in common law. For example, elements of the Magna Carta in it contain provisions on criminal law that were incorporated into the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution. It as well as other documents had elements influencing and incorporated into the United States constitution. Another area of cultural influence are American Patriotic songs: Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom.   Most of the heritage that all forty-four US presidents come from (or in some combination thereof): is British (English, Scottish, Scotch-Irish or Welsh) ancestry. Others include John F. Kennedy of Irish descent, Martin Van Buren of Dutch descent and two presidents whose fathers were of German descent: Dwight D. Eisenhower (whose original family name was Eisenhauer) and Herbert Hoover (Huber). Later U.S. Presidents' ancestry can often be traced to ancestors from multiple nations in Europe.  1st    George Washington 1789-1797 (English through great-grandfather John Washington, German through maternal grandfather Joseph Matthäus Ball, French through great-great-great-grandfather Nicolas Martiau) 2nd    John Adams 1797-1801 (English) 3rd    Thomas Jefferson 1801-1809 (Welsh, Scotch-English) 4th    James Madison 1809-1817 (English) 5th    James Monroe 1817-1825 (Scottish) 6th    John Quincy Adams 1825-1829 (English) 7th    Andrew Jackson 1829-1837  (Scotch-Irish) 8th    Martin Van Buren 1837-1841 (Dutch) 9th    William Henry Harrison 1841 (English) 10th   John Tyler 1841-1845 (English) 11th   James Knox Polk 1845-1849 (Scotch-Irish) 12th   Zachary Taylor 1849-1850 (English) 13th   Millard Fillmore 1850-1853 (Scottish, English) 14th   Franklin Pierce 1853-1857 (English) 15th   James Buchanan 1857-1861 (Scotch-Irish) 16th   Abraham Lincoln 1861-1865 (Welsh, English through ancestor Samuel Lincoln) 17th   Andrew Johnson 1865-1869 (Scotch-Irish, English) 18th   Ulysses Simpson Grant 1869-1877 (Scotch-Irish, English, Scottish, Walloon) 19th   Rutherford Birchard Hayes 1877-1881 (English, Scottish) 20th   James Abram Garfield 1881 (Welsh, English, French) 21st   Chester Alan Arthur 1881-1885 (Scotch-Irish, English) 22nd   Grover Cleveland 1885-1889 (English, Anglo-Irish, German) 23rd   Benjamin Harrison 1889-1893 (Scotch-Irish, English) 24th   Grover Cleveland 1893-1897 (English, Anglo-Irish, German) 25th   William McKinley 1897-1901 (Scotch-Irish, English) 26th   Theodore Roosevelt 1901-1909 (Dutch, Scotch-Irish, Scottish, English, Walloon) 27th   William Howard Taft 1909-1913 (Scotch-Irish, English) 28th   Woodrow Wilson 1913-1921 (Scotch-Irish, Scottish) 29th   Warren Gamaliel Harding 1921-1923 (Scotch-Irish, English) 30th   Calvin Coolidge 1923-1929 (English) 31st   Herbert Clark Hoover 1929-1933 (German, Swiss, English) 32nd   Franklin D.

DNA analysis of White Americans by geneticist Mark D. Shriver showed an average of 0.7% Sub-Saharan African admixture and 3.2% Native American admixture.Shriver, et al., "Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry and admixture mapping, Hum Genet (2003) 112 : 387–39. In another study, about 30% of all White Americans, approximately 66 million people, have a mean of 2.3% of Black African admixture. Southern states with the highest African American populations, tended to have the highest percentages of hidden African ancestry.Scott Hadly, "Hidden African Ancestry Redux", DNA USA*, 23andMe, March 4, 2014. Also, from the 23andMe database, about 5 to at least 13 percent of self-classified white American Southerners have greater than 1 percent African ancestry.

Apple pie - New England was the first region to experience large-scale English colonization in the early 17th century, beginning in 1620, and it was dominated by East Anglian Calvinists, better known as the Puritans. Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders and was the origin of dishes seen today as quintessentially "American", such as apple pie and the oven-roasted Thanksgiving turkey.Fischer, pp. 74, 114, 134–39. "As American as apple pie" is a well-known phrase used to suggest that something is all-American. Hamburger - Invented in the United States and known as "Hamburger" after German immigrants from Hamburg who named the unnamed food,according to a theory; see Hamburger this cultural and widely known icon has trans international reach and has been internationally known for decades as a symbol of American fast food. Tex-Mex - Invented in Texas and spread around Southwestern United States this fusion between traditional Mexican Cuisine and American Cuisine has become popular throughout the United States and in North America. Buffalo Wings - Created in Buffalo, New York in the 1970s this dish is chicken wings glazed and dipped in vinegar hot sauce and butter with cayenne peppers and spices until hot and tasty.buffalo Wing Now popular all over the country it has become a symbol of American cuisine. Thanksgiving - In the U.S. it has become a national secular holiday (official since 1863) with religious origins. The first Thanksgiving was celebrated by English settlers to give thanks to God and the Native Americans for helping the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony survive the brutal winter.William Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation 1620–1647, 85 The modern Thanksgiving holiday traces its origins from a 1621 celebration at the Plymouth Plantation, where the Plymouth settlers held a harvest feast with the Native Americans after a successful growing season. William Bradford is credited as the first to proclaim the American cultural event which is generally referred to as the "First Thanksgiving". Baseball - English lawyer William Bray recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey; Bray's diary was verified as authentic in September 2008. This early form of the game was apparently brought to North America by English immigrants. The first appearance of the term that exists in print was in "A Little Pretty Pocket-Book" in 1744, where it is called Base-Ball. Today, Rounders which has been played in England since Tudor times holds a similarity to Baseball. Although, literary references to early forms of "base-ball" in England pre-date use of the term "rounders". American football - can be traced to modified early versions of rugby football played in England and Canadian code football mixed with and ultimately changed by American innovations which led over time to the finished version of the game from 1876 to now. The basic set of rules were first developed in American universities in the mid-19th century. American National Anthem - takes its melody from the 18th-century English song "To Anacreon in Heaven" written by John Stafford Smith from England for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London and lyrics written by Francis Scott Key. This became a well-known and recognized patriotic song throughout the United States, which was officially designated as the U.S. national anthem in 1931.Star-Spangled Banner origins Amazing Grace - written by English poet and clergyman John Newton. Popular among African Americans, it became an icon in American culture and has been used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns. Hail, Columbia - initial presidential inauguration song up until early 20th century. Now used for the Vice President. Battle Hymn of the Republic - Patriotic song sung during the civil war time between 1861 - 1865. Harley-Davidson - The Davidson brothers were of Scottish descent (William. A. Davidson, Walter Davidson, Arthur Davidson) and William S. Harley of English descent. Along with Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Company was the largest and most recognizable American motorcycle manufacturer. European diaspora American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union Anglo Ethnic groups in Europe Hyphenated American Immigration to the United States Melting pot People of the United States White American Jewish Americans, particularly those of Ashkenazi and Sephardi descent, are a diaspora population with origins in South Western Asia, but are often classified as White rather than Asian. In addition, all of the original peoples of the Middle East are classified as White by the US Census Bureau. Gypsy Americans are a diaspora group with origins in the Indian Subcontinent, but are sometimes classified as European. Armenia is physiographically entirely in Western Asia, but it has strong historical and sociopolitical connections with Europe. The population and area figures include the entire state respectively. Azerbaijan is often considered a transcontinental country in the Caucasus (Europe) and Western Asia. However the population and area figures are for the entire state. This includes the exclave of Nakhchivan and the region Nagorno-Karabakh that has declared, and de facto achieved, independence. Nevertheless, it is not recognized de jure by sovereign states. Georgia is often considered a transcontinental country in the Caucasus (Europe) and Western Asia. It is placed in Europe by numerous European and international organizations. Turkey is physiographically considered a transcontinental country in Western Asia and south-eastern Europe. However the population and area figures include the entire state, both the 5% European and 95% Asian portions. The 1980 census had 188,302,438 people report at least one specific ancestry out of the then total 226,545,805 United States population. Numbers and percents by ancestry group do not add to totals because persons reporting a multiple ancestry are included in more than one group. Responses of total were: Single ancestry 63% and Multiple ancestry 37%. See 1980 U.S. Census for details. "American ethnicity" - (1990 Census) 12,395,999 (5.0% of total U.S. population); (2000 Census) 20,188,305 (7.2%). Mostly of English, Scottish, Scotch-Irish and/or Welsh ancestry that they cannot trace, given its predominance in the upper South (such as Kentucky). Also, two-thirds of white Americans have two or more different European nationalities, often four or more, and many "American" respondents may be cases where the person does not think any one ancestry is dominant enough to identify with (one typical example might be a person who is 1/4 Irish, 1/4 German, 1/4 Scottish, 1/8 Swedish, and 1/8 French). "White Hispanic and Latino Americans" - (2000 Census) 16,907,852 or 48% identified themselves as "White" of the then total Hispanic population.
