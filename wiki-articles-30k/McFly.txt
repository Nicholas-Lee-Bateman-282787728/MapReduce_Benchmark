     McFly are an English pop rock band formed in 2003. The band consists of Tom Fletcher (lead vocals, ukulele, guitar and piano), Danny Jones (lead vocals, harmonica and guitar), Dougie Poynter (bass guitar and vocals), and Harry Judd (drums). They were signed to Island Records from their 2004 launch until December 2007, before creating their own label, Super Records. McFly rose to fame after fellow band Busted helped launch them by inviting them to tour in 2004. In 2005, they won the Brit Award for Best British Pop Act."McFly BRITs Profile". Brits.co.uk. Retrieved 21 November 2012 McFly's debut album Room on the 3rd Floor debuted at number 1 in the UK Album Chart and is certified as double platinum; this led to them becoming known as the youngest band ever to have an album debut at number one—a title taken from The Beatles. A month after the album was released, the band had their first UK headlining tour. The band's second album, Wonderland, which was released in 2005, also charted at number 1 in the UK. Their third album, Motion in the Ocean, was released on 6 November 2006 and charted at number 6 in the UK. McFly released their All the Greatest Hits compilation album on 5 November 2007, which charted at number 4 in the UK. The band's fourth studio album, Radio:Active, was given away for free as a supplement in the Mail on Sunday on 20 July 2008, before being released in the conventional manner (via physical release) on 2 September 2008. Fifth album Above the Noise was released in November 2010 and charted at number 20. As of February 2014, McFly have had 18 consecutive UK top 20 singles, seven of which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and seventeen of which were consecutive top ten singles. In 2006, McFly appeared as themselves in the film Just My Luck, starring Lindsay Lohan and Chris Pine. They released a US album, Just My Luck, which was also used as the film's soundtrack. They have also performed at various charity projects such as Comic Relief, Children in Need, Live 8, Sport Relief and Earth Hour. The group have currently based on BPI certifications sold a minimum of 1.5 million albums in the UK alone. To date, McFly has sold more than 10 million records worldwide. In November 2013, it was announced that McFly would be joining forces with Busted to form the supergroup McBusted. They played a 34-date tour with both Busted and McFly songs. The only member of the original groups not participating in the new lineup is former Busted singer Charlie Simpson. In 2001, Tom Fletcher auditioned for Busted, but lost out on the place to Charlie Simpson. Fletcher was originally accepted as part of Busted's line-up, but Island Records went on to reassess the situation and eventually decided to have the band as a three-piece rather than a four-piece. Though the record label decided against offering Fletcher a place in Busted, they were intrigued by his songwriting talents and later offered him a place on Busted's songwriting 'team', alongside band member (and already accomplished songwriter) James Bourne; Fletcher has since stated that it was Bourne who taught him how to "properly" structure songs and how to "come up with good, poppy melodies". [[File:Room on the 3rd Floor (McFly album - cover art).jpg|thumb|Cover art for Mcfly's debut album [[Room on the 3rd Floor]] in 2004.]] While writing Busted's second album, ''[[A Present for Everyone]]'', Fletcher was asked by the record label if he was available to film auditions for a new band, [[V (band)|V]]. It was at this time that [[Danny Jones]] and Fletcher met for the first time; Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be an instrumental band rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing boyband, for which they were intended.<ref name="Guardian04">{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,1266615,00.html|title=Mad about the boys|author=Alexis Petridis|accessdate=23 November 2007|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}</ref> Fletcher was impressed with Jones' unique style and so approached and invited him to write with himself and Bourne.
