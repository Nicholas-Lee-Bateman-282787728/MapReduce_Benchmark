 The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 () (NATO reporting name: Foxbat) is a supersonic interceptor and reconnaissance aircraft that was among the fastest military aircraft to enter service. It was designed by the Soviet Union's Mikoyan-Gurevich bureau. The first prototype flew in 1964, and the aircraft entered service in 1970. It has an operational top speed of Mach&nbsp;2.83 (Mach 3.2 is possible but at risk of significant damage to the engines), and features a powerful radar and four air-to-air missiles. When first seen in reconnaissance photography, the large wing suggested an enormous and highly maneuverable fighter, at a time when U.S. design theories were also evolving towards higher maneuverability due to combat performance in the Vietnam War. The appearance of the MiG-25 sparked serious concern in the West and prompted dramatic increases in performance for the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle then under development in the late 1960s. The capabilities of the MiG-25 were better understood in 1976 when Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected in a MiG-25 to the United States via Japan. It turned out that the aircraft's weight necessitated its large wings. Production of the MiG-25 series ended in 1984 after completion of 1,190 aircraft. A symbol of the Cold War, the MiG-25 flew with Soviet allies and former Soviet republics, remaining in limited service in Russia and several other nations. It is one of the highest-flying military aircraft, and the second fastest after the SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft."Global Aircraft – Top 50 Fastest Aircraft." The Global Aircraft Organization, 24 April 2007. Retrieved: 30 June 2011. During the Cold War, Soviet Air Defence Forces, PVO (not to be confused with Soviet Air Force, VVS) was given the task of strategic air defence of the USSR. In the decades after World War II, this meant not only dealing with accidental border violations, but more importantly defending the vast airspace of the USSR against US reconnaissance aircraft and strategic bombers carrying free-fall nuclear bombs. The performance of these types of aircraft was steadily improved.  Overflights by the very high altitude American Lockheed U-2 in the late 1950s revealed a need for higher altitude interceptor aircraft than currently available.Rich and Janos 1994, p. 15. The subsonic Boeing B-47 Stratojet and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers were followed by the Mach&nbsp;2 Convair B-58 Hustler, with the Mach&nbsp;3 North American B-70 Valkyrie on the drawing board at that time. A major upgrade in the PVO defence system was required, and at the start of 1958 a requirement was issued for manned interceptors capable of reaching 3,000&nbsp;km/h (1,864&nbsp;mph) and heights of up to 27&nbsp;km (88,583&nbsp;ft). Mikoyan and Sukhoi responded.Gordon and Gunston 2000, p. 166.  The Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB had been working on a series of interceptors during the second half of the 1950s: the I-1, I-3U, I-7U, I-75, Ye-150, Ye-150A, Ye-152, Ye-152A, Ye-152P, and Ye-152M. The Ye-150 was noteworthy because it was built specifically to test the Tumansky R-15 engine, two of which would later be used for the MiG-25.  This led to Ye-152, alternatively known as Ye-166, which set several world records.Gordon and Gunston 2000, p. 106.  The Ye-152M (converted from one of the two Ye-152 aircraft) was intended to be the definite heavy interceptor design. But before it was finished, the PVO had selected the Tupolev Tu-128. As the work on the MiG-25 was well under way, the single-engine Ye-152M was abandoned. Work on the new Soviet interceptor that became the MiG-25 started in mid-1959, a year before Soviet intelligence learned of the American Mach 3 A-12 reconnaissance aircraft.Spick 2000  It is not clear if the design was influenced by the American A-5 Vigilante. The design bureau studied several possible layouts for the new aircraft. One had the engines located side-by-side, as on the MiG-19. The second had a stepped arrangement with one engine amidships, with exhaust under the fuselage, and another in the aft fuselage. The third project had an engine arrangement similar to that of the English Electric Lightning, with two engines stacked vertically. Option two and three were both rejected because the size of the engines meant any of them would result in a very tall aircraft which would complicate maintenance. The idea of placing the engines in underwing nacelles was also rejected because of the dangers of any thrust asymmetry during flight. Having decided on engine configuration, there was thought of giving the machine variable-sweep wings and a second crew member, a navigator. Variable geometry would improve maneuverability at subsonic speed, but at the cost of decreased fuel tank capacity. Because the reconnaissance aircraft would operate at high speed and high altitude the idea was soon dropped. Another interesting but impractical idea was to improve the field performance using two RD36-35 lift-jets. Vertical takeoff and landing would allow for use of damaged runways during wartime and was studied on both sides of the Iron Curtain. The perennial problem with engines dedicated to vertical lift is they become mere deadweight in horizontal flight, and also occupy space in the airframe needed for fuel. The MiG interceptor would need all the fuel it could get, so the idea was abandoned. The first prototype was a reconnaissance variant, designated "Ye-155-R1", that made its first flight on 6 March 1964.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 398. It had some characteristics that were unique to that prototype, and some of these were visually very evident: the wings had fixed wingtip tanks (600 litre capacity) to which small winglets were attached for stability purposes, but when it was found that fuel sloshing around in the tanks caused vibrations they were eliminated. The aircraft also had attachments for movable foreplanes, canards, to help with pitch control at high speed (provisions for canards had previously been installed, but not used, on the Ye-152P.)Lake 1998, p. 108.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 272–274. The first flight of the interceptor prototype, "Ye-155-P1", took place on 9 September 1964.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 391. Development of the MiG-25, which represented a major step forward in Soviet aerodynamics, engineering and metallurgy, took several more years to complete.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 387–388. On 9 July 1967, the new aircraft was first shown to the public at the Domodedovo air show, with four prototypes (three fighters and a reconnaissance aircraft) making a flypast.Lake 1998, p. 109. The Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau soon realized that the performance of the new aircraft gave it great potential to set new flight records. In addition to their normal duties, the prototypes Ye-155-P1, Ye-155-R1, Ye-155-R3 were made lighter by removing some unneeded equipment, and were used for these attempts. Under Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) classification the Ye-155 type belonged to class C1 (III), which specifies jet-powered land planes with unlimited maximum take-off weight. Records set included: In all 29 records were claimed, of which seven were all-time world records for time to height, altitudes of 20,000 m and higher, and speed. Several records still stand. Because of the thermal stresses incurred in flight above Mach 2, the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB had difficulties choosing what materials to use for the aircraft. They had to use E-2 heat-resistant Plexiglas for the canopy, and high-strength stainless steel for the wings and fuselage. Using titanium rather than steel would have been ideal, but it was expensive and difficult to work with. The problem of cracks in welded titanium structures with thin walls could not be solved, so the heavier nickel steel was used instead.  It cost far less than titanium and allowed for welding, along with heat resistant seals.Gordon 2008  The MiG-25 was constructed from 80% nickel steel alloy, 11% aluminium, and 9% titanium.Eden 2004, p. 308.  The steel components were formed by a combination of spot-welding, automatic machine welding and hand arc welding methods. Initially, the interceptor version was equipped with the TL-25 Smerch-A (also referred to as Product 720) radar, a development of the system carried by the earlier Tu-128. While powerful, and thus long-ranged and resistant to jamming, the system – due to the age of its design and its intended purpose (tracking and targeting high- and fast-flying US bombers and reconnaissance aircraft), lacked look-down/shoot-down capability, which limited its effectiveness against low-flying targets (this is one of the reasons why it was replaced with the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31, whose Zaslon radar has that capability). By the time the MiG-25 entered service in 1969, this was a serious shortcoming, as strategic bombing doctrine was shifting towards low-level penetration of enemy territory. After Belenko's defection to Japan exposed this flaw to the West, a government decree issued on November 4, 1976 called for urgent development of a more advanced radar. This resulted in the pulse-Doppler radar Sapphire-25 system fitted to the MiG-25PD variant.

Armament interceptor includes four supersonic (M>5) UR great range R-40T (R-40TD) air-to-air missiles with thermal homing head and R-40P (R-40RD) with semi-active radar guidance system (maximum launch range, on altitudinal goal on a collision course – 35–60&nbsp;km). Under the fuselage can suspended fuel tank.  The aircraft could carry unguided gravity bombs in a rudimentary strike capability. As the bombs would weigh no more and incur no more drag than its regular load of R-40 missiles, its performance was not impaired, leading to some impressive bombing feats; when released at an altitude of 20,000m (66,000&nbsp;ft) and a speed above Mach 2, a 500&nbsp;kg bomb would have a glide range of several tens of kilometres. The MiG-25 was theoretically capable of a maximum speed of Mach 3+ and a ceiling of 90,000&nbsp;ft (27,000 m). Its high speed was problematic: although sufficient thrust was available to reach Mach 3.2, a limit of Mach 2.83 had to be imposed as the turbines tended to overspeed and overheat at higher speeds, possibly damaging them beyond repair."Intelligence: Big-Mouth Belenko." Time, 11 October 1976. Retrieved: 12 May 2010.Gunston and Spick pp. 132–133. Full-scale production of the MiG-25R ('Foxbat-B') began in 1969 at the Gorkii aircraft factory (Plant No.21). The MiG-25P ("Foxbat-A") followed in 1971, and 460 of this variant was built until production ended in 1982.  The improved PD variant that replaced it was built from 1978 till 1984 with 104 aircraft completed. But from then on the Gorkii factory switched over production to the new MiG-31. Inaccurate intelligence analysis caused the West initially to believe the MiG-25 was an agile air-combat fighter rather than an interceptor. In response, the United States started a new program which resulted in the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.Jenkins 1998, pp. 6–7.  NATO obtained a better understanding of the MiG-25's capabilities on 6 September 1976, when a Soviet Air Defence Forces pilot, Lt. Viktor Belenko, defected, landing his MiG-25P at Hakodate Airport in Japan.Barron 1980, p. 15. The pilot overshot the runway on landing and damaged the front landing gear.  Despite Soviet protests, the Japanese invited U.S. Air Force personnel to investigate the aircraft.Barron 1980, p. 131.  On 25 September, it was moved by a C-5A transport to a base in central Japan, where it was carefully dismantled and analyzed.Barron 1980, photoplates.  After 67 days, the aircraft was returned by ship to the Soviets, in pieces.Barron 1980, p. 180. The aircraft was reassembled and is now on display at the Sokol plant in Nizhny Novgorod. The analysis, based on technical manuals and ground tests of engines and avionics, revealed unusual technical information: As the result of Belenko's defection and the compromise of the MiG-25P's radar and missile systems, beginning in 1976, the Soviets started to develop an advanced version, the MiG-25PD ("Foxbat-E"). Plans for a new aircraft to develop the Foxbat's potential to go faster than the in-service limit of Mach 2.8 were designed as a flying prototype. Unofficially designated MiG-25M, it had new powerful engines R15BF2-300, improved radar, and missiles. This work never resulted in a machine for series production, as the coming MiG-31 showed more promise. The unarmed 'B' version had greater impact than the interceptor when the USSR sent two MiG-25R, and two MiG-25RB to Egypt in March 1971 and stayed until July 1972. They were operated by the Soviet 63rd Independent Air Detachment (Det 63) set up specially for this mission. Det 63 flew over Israeli held territory in Sinai on reconnaissance missions roughly 20 times. The flights were in pairs at maximum speed and high altitude (between 17,000–23,000 m). On 6 November 1971, a Soviet MiG-25 operating out of Egypt flying at Mach 2.5 was met by Israeli F-4Es and fired upon unsuccessfully."Foxbats over Sinai." spyflight.co.uk. Retrieved: 5 September 2010. A MiG-25 was tracked flying over Sinai at Mach 3.2 during this period. The MiG-25 engines went into overspeed, which led to them being scrapped. Unit Det 63 was sent back home in 1972, though reconnaissance Foxbats were sent back to Egypt in 19–20 October 1973 during the Yom Kippur War. Unit Det 154 remained there until late 1974. During the 1970s, the Soviet air force conducted reconnaissance overflights across Iran using its MiG-25RBSh aircraft in response to joint US-Iran recon operations. The Swedish Air Force observed via radar a Soviet Air Defense MiG-25 at 63,000&nbsp;ft trailed 2.9&nbsp;km behind the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird at 72,000&nbsp;ft over the Baltic Sea in the 1980s. On 13 February 1981, the Israeli Air Force sent two RF-4Es over Lebanon as decoys for Syrian MiG-25 interceptors. As the MiGs scrambled, the RF-4Es turned back delivering chaff and using ECM pods. Two IDF/AF F-15As were waiting for the MiGs and shot one of them down with AIM-7F missiles. The other MiG was able to escape.Aloni 2006, p. 33. In a similar engagement, on 29 July 1981, a Syrian MiG-25 was again downed by an Israeli F-15A,Aloni 2006, pp. 37–38.Gordon 1997, p. 53. after which a second MiG-25 launched its R-40 missiles at the F-15 and its wingman, but they missed.Aloni 2006, p. 38. However, other sources state the missiles hit and downed one of the F-15s.  On 31 August 1982, a third Syrian MiG-25 was damaged by an Israeli Hawk SAM and then destroyed by an F-15.Aloni 2006, p. 64. The MiG-25 was in service with the Iraqi Air Force during the Iran–Iraq War.  On 19 March 1982 an Iranian F-4E was badly damaged by missile fired by an Iraqi MiG-25. Iraqi MiG-25s made another kill against Iran in February 1983, when an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down an Iranian C-130. In April 1984, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down an Iranian F-5E. On 21 March 1984, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down an Iranian F-4E and on 5 June 1985 an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down a second Iranian F-4E. On 23 February 1986, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down an Iranian EC-130E and on 10 June an RF-4E, later in October 1986, an Iraqi MiG-25PDS shot down a second RF-4E.Mevlutoglu, Arda. "Airshow Turkiye 2011." ACIG, 11 June 2011. Retrieved; 30 June 2011. The most successful Iraqi MiG-25 pilot of the war was Colonel Mohammed Rayyan, who was credited with 10 kills.  Eight of these were while flying the MiG-25P from 1981 to 1986.  In 1986, after attaining the rank of Colonel, Rayyan was shot down and killed by Iranian F-14s.Nicolle and Cooper 2004, pp. 82, 86. For the majority of the air combat Iraqi pilots used R-40 missiles. On 3 May 1981, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down an Algerian Gulfstream III. On 2 October 1986, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down a Syrian MiG-21RF. According to research by journalist Tom Cooper, at least 10 MiG-25s (9 reconnaissance and 1 fighter) may have been shot down by Iranian F-14s (one of them shared with an F-5) during the Iran-Iraq war.Cooper, Tom and Farzad Bishop. Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat, pp. 85–88. Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2004.

Two IQAF MiG-25s were shot down by U.S. Air Force F-15s on January 19. The MiGs attempted to hide from the F-15s by using chaff and electronic jammers in order to engage the F-15s undetected. However the F-15 pilots were able to reacquire the two Iraqi MiG-25s and shot both down with AIM-7 Sparrow missiles.  In another incident, an Iraqi MiG-25PD, after eluding eight USAF F-15s at long range, fired three missiles at General Dynamics EF-111A Raven electronic warfare aircraft, forcing them to abort their mission and leave attacking aircraft without electronic jamming support.Atkinson 1993, pp. 125–126. In a different incident, two MiG-25s approached a pair of F-15s, fired missiles at long range which were evaded by the F-15s, and then outran the American fighters. Two more F-15s joined the pursuit, and a total of 10 air-to-air missiles were fired at the MiG-25s, though none reached them.Atkinson 1993, pp. 230–231. According to the same sources, at least one F-111 was also forced to abort its mission by a MiG-25 on the first 24 hours of hostilities, during an air raid over Tikrit.Atkinson 1993, p. 75. After the war, on 27 December 1992, a U.S. F-16D downed a MiG-25 that violated the no-fly zone in southern Iraq with an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile. It was the first USAF F-16 air-to-air victory and the first AMRAAM kill. On 23 December 2002, an Iraqi MiG-25 shot down a U.S. Air Force unmanned MQ-1 Predator drone, which was performing armed reconnaissance over Iraq. This was the first time in history that an aircraft and an unmanned drone had engaged in combat. Predators had been armed with AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, and were being used to "bait" Iraqi fighter aircraft, then run. In this incident, the Predator did not run, but instead fired one of the Stingers, which missed, while the MiG's missile did not.Krane, Jim. "Pilotless Warriors Soar To Success." CBS News, 25 April 2003."Video of Shoot-Down." CBS. Retrieved: 5 September 2010. No Iraqi aircraft were deployed in the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, with most Iraqi aircraft being hidden or destroyed on the ground. In August 2003, several dozen Iraqi aircraft were discovered buried in the sand. The MiG-25 was kept a guarded secret in India, and was nicknamed "Garuda", after the large mythical bird-like creature from Hindu and Buddhist mythology. It was used extensively in the Kargil War and Operation Parakram, conducting aerial reconnaissance sorties over Pakistan.Bhonsle 2006, p. 256. In May 1997, an Indian Air Force Mikoyan MiG-25RB reconnaissance aircraft created a furor when the pilot flew faster than Mach 2 over Pakistani territory following a reconnaissance mission into Pakistan airspace.So long, old superspy in the sky – Record-holder MiG 25, Indian Air Force’s relic from the Cold War era, flies its last sortie  The Telegraph 1 May 2006 The MiG-25 broke the sound barrier while flying at an altitude of around , otherwise the mission would have remained covert, at least to the general public. The Pakistan Government considered the breaking of the sound barrier was deliberate to make the point that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had no aircraft in its inventory which can come close to the MiG-25's cruising altitude (up to ). India denied the incident but Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Gohar Ayub Khan, believed that the Foxbat photographed strategic installations near the capital, Islamabad.Steinemann, Peter.

Lack of spare parts and India's acquiring of unmanned aerial vehicles and satellite imagery eventually led to its retirement in 2006. Libya was a major user of the MiG-25 as it imported 96 MiG-25PD interceptor, MiG-25PU trainer and MiG-25RBK reconnaissance aircraft in the late 1970s and early 1980s.http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=39082:libyan-mig-25-destroyed-in-crash&catid=35:Aerospace&Itemid=107 During the 1980s, Libya confronted the United States over some claims over the extension of its territorial waters. These incidents prompted a number of encounters between the opposing forces as it happened during the Gulf of Sidra incident (1981) with the Libyan MiG-25s taking part in them. During the following years, the Libyan MiG-25 fleet was grounded, lacking maintenance. As MiG-25 air-frames were grounded for several years, NATO attacks spared them during the Libyan Civil War (2011). In 2014 and 2015, the Libyan forces under the New General National Congress controlled a number of former LARAF air-frames, that were retired and stored before the Libyan Civil War in 2011, among them a number of MiG-25s. Technicians started working on some of the air-frames to push them back to service in the fight against the opposing internationally recognized Libyan government forces. On 6 May 2015, a New General National Congress MiG-25PU crashed near Zintan while attacking the civilian airport controlled by the opposing internationally recognized Libyan government, the pilot ejected and was captured by opposing forces which also claimed they downed the jet.http://www.janes.com/article/51223/mig-25-crashes-in-libya The jet was at one of its first flights after re-entering service.

Ostapenko reached 25,000 m in 3 min 12.6 sec and 30,000 m in 4 min 3.86 sec. On 25 July 1973, Fedotov reached 35,230m with 1,000&nbsp;kg payload, and 36,240 m with no load (an absolute world record).Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 392. In the thin air, the engines flamed out and the aircraft coasted in a ballistic trajectory by inertia alone. At the apex the speed had dropped to 75&nbsp;km/h. On 31 August 1977, "Ye-266M" again flown by Fedotov, set the recognized absolute altitude record for a jet aircraft under its own power.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 406–407. He reached  at Podmoskovnoye, USSR in zoom climb (the absolute altitude record is different from the record for sustained altitude in horizontal flight). The aircraft was actually a MiG-25RB re-engined with the powerful R15BF2-300. It had earlier been part of the program to improve the aircraft's top speed that resulted in the MiG-25M prototype. Belenko's particular aircraft was brand new, representing the latest Soviet technology. The aircraft was assembled quickly, and was essentially built around its massive Tumansky R-15(B) turbojets. Welding was done by hand.  Rivets with non-flush heads were used in areas that would not cause adverse aerodynamic drag. The aircraft was built of a nickel alloy and not titanium as was assumed (though some titanium was used in heat-critical areas). The steel construction contributed to the craft's high 29,000&nbsp;kg (64,000&nbsp;lb) unarmed weight. Maximum acceleration (g-load) rating was just 2.2&nbsp;g (21.6&nbsp;m/s²) with full fuel tanks, with an absolute limit of 4.5&nbsp;g (44.1&nbsp;m/s²). One MiG-25 withstood an inadvertent 11.5&nbsp;g (112.8&nbsp;m/s²) pull during low-altitude dogfight training, but the resulting deformation damaged the airframe beyond repair."MiG-25." globalaircraft.org. Retrieved: 5 September 2010. Combat radius was , and maximum range on internal fuel (at subsonic speeds) was only  at low altitude ( The airspeed indicator was redlined at Mach 2.8, with typical intercept speeds near Mach 2.5 in order to extend the service life of the engines.  A MiG-25 was tracked flying over Sinai at Mach 3.2 in the early 1970s, but the flight led to the engines being damaged beyond repair.Barron 1980, pp. 169–171. The majority of the on-board avionics were based on vacuum-tube technology, not solid-state electronics. Although they represented aging technology, vacuum tubes were more tolerant of temperature extremes, thereby removing the need for environmental controls in the avionics bays. With the use of vacuum tubes, the MiG-25P's original Smerch-A (Tornado, NATO reporting name "Foxfire") radar had enormous power – about 600 kilowatts. As with most Soviet aircraft, the MiG-25 was designed to be as robust as possible. The use of vacuum tubes also makes the aircraft's systems resistant to an electromagnetic pulse, for example after a nuclear blast.Broad, William J.

On 12 April 1984, #736 crashed near Balchik. The pilot ejected successfully. They were operated by 26th RAB at Dobrich until their withdrawal. In May 1991, the surviving MiG-25s were returned to the USSR in exchange for five MiG-23MLDs. Belarus Air Force – Had up to 50 MiG-25s, including 13 MiG-25PDs; by 1995 the type had been withdrawn. Indian Air Force – Took delivery of six MiG-25RBKs and two MiG-25RUs in 1981. They were operated by No. 102 Squadron "Trisonics" based at Bakshi-ka-talab AB in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. One RBK crashed on 3 August 1994. Retired from service in May 2006."India retires Cold War spy MiGs." BBC News. 9 April 2006. Retrieved: 30 June 2011.

The remains of one MiG-25 airframe, presumably destroyed during the Gulf War, rests at Al Asad Air Base. Notably, the IrAF roundels on the vertical stabilizers have been surgically cut out. This airframe is visible in Google Maps; it is located northwest of the Al Asad cantonment area. Georgian Air Force Libyan Air Force – Operated a large number of MiG-25s, some sources say more than 60 were delivered. Types were of the MiG-25PD, MiG-25RBK, MiG-25PU and MiG-25RU variants. They were operated by No.1025 Squadron at Jufra-Hun, No.1055 Squadron at Ghardabiya and an unidentified squadron at Sabha Air Base. Russian Air Force Soviet Air Forces and Soviet Air Defence Forces – The largest combined operator historically, Soviet aircraft were passed on to its successor states in 1991. Military of Turkmenistan Ukrainian Air Force – Took over 79 aircraft after the breakup of the USSR. They have been withdrawn from service. MiG-25PD Red 49 (c/n N84008895) is on display at the Central Armed Forces Museum, Moscow, Russia. MiG-25RB (s/n 25105) is in the restoration facility at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. This aircraft was found in 2003 during the opening months of Operation Iraqi Freedom by American forces, buried in the sand near Al Taqaddum Airbase, about 250&nbsp;km west of Baghdad. The aircraft had been buried to prevent its destruction on the ground by coalition aircraft. When uncovered, the MiG-25RB was incomplete, as the wings could not be located. This aircraft was one of two MiG-25s transported by a Lockheed C-5A Galaxy from Iraq to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for examination. It was donated to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in December 2006. The museum's restoration staff is currently attempting to locate a set of wings to complete the aircraft for display."Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25." nationalmuseum.af.mil. Retrieved: 7 September 2015.
