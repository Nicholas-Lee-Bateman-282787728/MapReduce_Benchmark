  Pseudo-anglicisms are words in languages other than English which were borrowed from English but are used in a way native English speakers would not readily recognize or understand. Pseudo-anglicisms often take the form of compound words, combining elements of multiple English words to create a new word that appears to be English but is unrecognisable to a native speaker of English. It is also common for a genuine English word to be used to mean something completely different from its original meaning. Pseudo-anglicisms are related to false friends or false cognates. Many speakers of a language which employs pseudo-anglicisms believe that the relevant words are genuine anglicisms and can be used in English, which may cause misunderstandings. When many English words are incorporated into many languages, language enthusiasts and purists often look down on this phenomenon, terming it (depending on the importing language) Denglisch, Franglais or similar neologisms. Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, (Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change, Series editor: Charles Jones). ISBN 1-4039-1723-X. Many of the following examples may be found in several words (Fun Sport), hyphenated (Fun-Sport), in one word (Funsport) or CamelCase (FunSport).   Except when the English pronunciation is obviously indicated by widely known spelling rules, such as "ee", "ay", "oo", "ou" and "a+consonant+e" standing for , , , , and  (only in Portugal; Brazilians will pronounce the vowels near-correctly but the consonants always in the way they would pronounce them in Portuguese), instead of the expected , , , ,  (non-nasal consonant) and  (nasal), all Lusophone Latin Americans and Africans and most Portuguese and Macanese will invariably use spelling pronunciations for pseudo-anglicisms as those that know proper English pronunciation and spelling rules would naturally be expected to know that those words are not real English, so that soda and tuning come out as  (roughly like "sawtha" or "soth-a") and  (roughly like "toonyeen'"), much as English-like filler (used mainly in Brazil, in the context of anime episodes not derived from the storyline of the manga from which they derive) and nylon would be  (roughly "feel-egh") and  (roughly "nye lon'") in non-affected pronunciations, though tupperware is rather similar to a native form (, ). Phonotactic and phonological rules of Portuguese or of certain Portuguese dialects, such as specific palatalization and vowel reduction patterns, also apply, so that while e.g. nice in São Paulo would become , a native English form, in Rio de Janeiro it would become  (roughly "nicie") or  ("nye, sss!"), as  at the end of a syllable in the local dialect is non-existent – the local pronunciation of the archiphoneme /coda sibilant/ is palatalized , the hushing second consonant in Japanese sushi. Brazilians, and some Africans and rural Portuguese with archaic dialects resembling Brazilian Portuguese, are known to insert an epenthetic  after virtually every final closed syllable to break them into two different open syllables, so that hippie and hip (as star and estar/está, similar to Spanish) would sound wholly or nearly homophonous as , in the same way flirt became flerte (,  in Portugal) with time. Words that are not slang anymore tend to be adapted to Portuguese orthography. 140. http://tl.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_Tagalog_translation_for_ballpen  Air-Condition (German, Greek, Serbo-Croatian, Swedish) – air conditioning Apart (Japanese アパート, Korean 아파트) – apartment Autostop (or in some languages stop) (Bulgarian, Czech, French, Greek, Hungarian, Italian,«Autostop» , Vocabolario Treccani on line, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovak, Spanish, Turkish) – hitchhiking Basket (Arabic, Danish, French, Indonesian, Italian,«Basket» , Vocabolario Treccani on line, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana Greek, Persian, Serbo-Croatian (one-hoop variant), Spanish, Swedish, Turkish) – basketball Baskets (French, Romanian) – sneakers Beamer (Dutch, German, Romanian) – (digital) video projector Beefsteak (French bifteck, Spanish bistec, Serbo-Croatian, Turkish biftek) – from beefsteak, but steak in general Beauty farm (Dutch, German Beauty-Farm and Beautyfarm, Italian«Beauty farm» , Vocabolario Treccani on line, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana) – spa Black Music (French, German) – urban music (but used by English speakers in a less than politically correct sense) Body (Hungarian, Turkish) – bodybuilding Body (for dancing) (German, Finnish, French, Italian,«Body» , Vocabolario Treccani on line, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana Romanian) – leotard Body (for infants) (German, French, Italian, Polish, Spanish, Turkish badi, Serbo-Croatian bodi) – infant bodysuit Body (Estonian, Serbo-Croatian) – bodysuit Box (for toddlers) (Dutch, Italian) – playpen Box (for vehicles) (French, Italian) – garage Box (in motorsports) (German, Italian, Croatian) – place on a race track where pit stops are conducted Break (French, Romanian brec) – station wagon (American English) or estate car (British English) – cf. shooting-brake Bullying – stalking Camera (Greek, Vietnamese, Russian, Polish kamera) – camcorder Camping (Croatian, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish) – campsite Camping-car (French, Japanese キャンピングカー) – campervan or "recreational vehicle" Car (French, Swiss German) – coach, tour bus or inter-city bus Catch (French; now considered old-fashioned in German and Italian) – professional wrestling Classic music (Japanese クラシック音楽, Korean 클래식 음악, Turkish) – classical music Closet (Serbo-Croatian, Russian) – watercloset Coffee (some Arabic dialects) – café Cornflakes (Arabic, Greek, Turkish) – any breakfast cereal Cunning (Japanese カンニング, Korean 커닝) – cheating Dancing (Flemish, French, Italian, Polish) – dance hall or dancing-house or nightclub Discount (Diskont) (German, Polish, Serbo-Croatian) – a store Dress (Estonian, Serbo-Croatian, Polish) – athletic garments Evergreen (Dutch, German, Italian, Serbian, Swedish) – an enduringly popular song Feeling (Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian) – personal chemistry, common bondAccording to linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, this pseudo-anglicism might have "been influenced by Italian fili 'threads' (plural of Italian filo 'thread'.)

(meaning "Deborah and Giovanni got so cool wearing skinny jeans and dark glasses, and cutting the hair in bangs!")
