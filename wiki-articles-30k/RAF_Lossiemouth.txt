     Royal Air Force Lossiemouth or more commonly RAF Lossiemouth  is a military airfield located on the western edge of the town of Lossiemouth in Moray, north east Scotland. Lossiemouth is one of the largest and busiest fast-jet stations in the Royal Air Force and known for its close proximity to flight training areas in Scotland and it's favourable local flying conditions. It is now the only operational RAF station in Scotland and is one of two main operating bases for the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 in the UK. It is home to three frontline units which operate the Typhoon (No. 1 Squadron, No. 2 (AC) Squadron and No. 6 Squadron) each of which contribute to the Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North capability which provides protection to UK airspace 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The Tornado GR4  Operational Conversion Unit, XV(Reserve) Squadron is also based at the station. The airfield opened in 1939 and was operated by the RAF predominately as part of Bomber Command until 1946 when it was handed over to the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) and became known as RNAS Lossiemouth (HMS Fulmar). The FAA used Lossiemouth as a training station until it was handed back to the RAF in September 1972, after which it has operated largely as fast-jet base. Construction started during the summer of 1938 when 220 hectares of agricultural land was acquired in order to accommodate the air station. The land was cleared of vegetation and buildings and by the spring of 1939 several wooden huts were present. Group Captain P.E Maitland AFC MVO was the first station commander and took up post in March 1939, with the station formally opening on 1 May 1939.  The first unit to take up residence at Lossiemouth was No. 15 Flight Training School, initially equipped with thirteen Airspeed Oxfords and five Hawker Harts. Aircraft were stored in the open until the first hangars were completed in August 1939. That same month tragedy struck when three crew members were killed during a mid-air collision between two Oxfords. At the outbreak of the Second World War a detachment of Seaforth Highlanders was sent to Lossiemouth to guard the station and anti-aircraft defences installed. Flying activity increased with 15 FTS receiving further Oxfords and Harts and the introduction of the North American Harvard. Eleven Fairey Battles were also delivered for storage. The first front-line aircraft to operate from Lossiemouth were a detachment of twelve Vickers Wellington bombers belonging to No. 99 Squadron. They arrived for a short period in November 1939 to take part in attack missions targeting the German cruiser Deutschland which was operating between Iceland and Shetland. January 1940 saw a detachment of No. 44 Squadron and No. 50 Squadron Handley Page Hampdens arrive to take part in offensive patrols over the North Sea. However the operation was short-lived as a result of bad weather, with the aircraft returning to their home base in mid February.  A detachment of No. 9 Squadron spent a short period of time operating Wellingtons during April 1940 before being replaced by No.107 Squadron and No. 110 Squadron which were equipped with Bristol Blenheims. During this period the first loss to enemy action of an aircraft operating from Lossiemouth occurred when three Blenheims were shot down over Norway. It soon became apparent that the frequent detachments of bomber aircraft were disrupting the training programme at Lossiemouth and therefore, due to the strategic importance of the station as a base for bomber aircraft, it was decided to relocate 15 FTS to RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire. On 27 April 1940, after the unit’s departure, Lossiemouth transferred to No. 6 Group of RAF Bomber Command and No. 20 Operational Training Unit (OTU) was established, initially operating Wellingtons and Avro Ansons. 46 Maintenance Unit (MU) was also formed in April 1940. 46 MU’s role was to modify and fit-out new aircraft before being forwarded to front-line squadrons. A variety of aircraft were serviced including Hawker Hurricanes, de Havilland Tiger Moths, Hawker Audaxes, and a de Havilland Hornet Moth. The unit primarily used six Robin and eight Super Robin hangars, however due to a shortage of space many aircraft were stored in fields outside the station. Lossiemouth's first satellite airfield, located at Bogs of Mayne 10 miles to the south and known as RAF Elgin, opened in June 1940. One officer and two aircrew were killed on 26 October 1940 when RAF Lossiemouth was attacked by the Luftwaffe for the first time. The attack by three Heinkel He 111s resulted in the destruction of two Blenheims and damage to two Miles Magisters, two Moths and a Hurricane. Three hangars were also damaged, the resultant holes from cannon fire still visible today. One of the Heinkels crashed on the airfield, having either been hit by ground fire or destroyed by its own bombs. All four Luftwaffe pilots are buried in a Lossiemouth churchyard. As a result of the raid, Hurricanes of No. 232 Squadron were moved to RAF Elgin to protect the area from future attacks. Flying activity in early 1941 was limited due to the poor condition of the airfield, however improved weather in the Spring increased activity from No. 20 OTU and 46 MU as well as continued bomber detachments. Operational sorties were predominately undertaken by Blenheims of No. 21 Squadron, No. 82 Squadron, No.110 Squadron and No. 114 Squadron. However, by the winter of 1941 the airfield had become so muddy that the Wellingtons of No. 20 OTU were temporarily relocated to RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk. The increased activity by 46 MU resulted in two satellite landing grounds (SLG) being established to store aircraft off-site. These were at RAF Black Isle (No. 42 SLG) where Bristol Beaufighters were kept and RAF Leanach (No. 43 SLG) near Culloden, where Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires were stored.  Lossiemouth was used during 1942 as a base to launch several unsuccessful missions to sink the German battle ship Tirpitz, which at the time was operating in Norwegian fjords. The first missions were undertaken in January 1942 by a detachment of thirteen Shorts Stirlings of No. 15 Squadron & No. 149 Squadron and thirteen Handley Page Halifaxes of No. 10 Squadron & No. 76 Squadron. Further attempts were made during March by Avro Lancasters of No. 44 Squadron and Halifaxes of No. 10 Squadron. Lancasters of No. 9 Squadron later joined the operation. 1942 also saw numerous accidents involving No. 20 OTU aircraft, many of which resulted in death and serious injuries. These accidents were attributed to a combination of fatigued aircraft, inexperienced crews and poor weather. Wellingtons of No. 20 OTU were also involved in strategic bombing raids on German cities throughout 1942, the training aircraft being required to help reach the target number of 1000 bombers per raid. The airfield’s first surfaced runways were constructed by an engineering battalion of the US Army Air Force in late 1942 and helped to reduce interruptions to flying as a result of the grass strips being affected by poor weather. The three runways were 1828m (runway 06/24), 1371m (09/27) and 1280m (01/19) in length. A new control tower was also constructed. In September 1943, Wellingtons of No. 20 OTU's 'C' Flight moved to the second of Lossiemouth's satellite airfields, RAF Milltown, located 3 miles to the south east. By now 46 MU were concentrating their work on Bristol Beaufighters and Lancasters and the SLG at RAF Leanach had been replaced with a new site at Dornoch golf course, which became known as RAF Dornoch (No. 40 SLG). 20 OTU received its official crest in 1943, with two examples cast in concrete being constructed at Lossiemouth and RAF Elgin. Although little now remains of the airfield at Elgin, the concrete crest is still in situ and acts as a war memorial for those who served there. Further operations against the still active Tirpitz took place between September and November 1944. Operation Catechism finally resulted in the German battleship being sunk near Tromsø on 12 November 1944. A total of 38 Lancasters of No.9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron launched from Lossiemouth, Kinloss and Milltown and successfully destroyed the vessel with their Tallboy bombs. Nearly 50 years later No. 617 Squadron transferred to Lossiemouth and was permanently based there between 1993 and 2014. Examples of the Tallboy, Grand Slam and Up Keep bouncing bomb were on display within the squadron site during this time. In July 1945, after the end of hostilities in Europe, No. 20 OTU was disbanded and No. 46 MU continued to prepare aircraft for operations in the Far East where the war continued. After the war 46 MU began the enormous task of breaking-up surplus aircraft for scrap. At one point there were around 900 aircraft present at the airfield awaiting disposal. On 28 July 1945 Lossiemouth was transferred to No. 17 Group of RAF Coastal Command, with the arrival of No. 111 OTU from the Bahamas shortly thereafter. By August 1945 the units were operating 41 Consolidated B-24 Liberators, 10 Halifaxes and a single North American B-25 Mitchell. The units continued operating until July 1946 before it was disbanded. Lossiemouth transferred from the Royal Air Force to the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) on 2 July 1946 and became known as Royal Navy Air Station (RNAS) Lossiemouth or alternatively as HMS Fulmar. On the FAA taking control, No. 46 MU moved to RAF Elgin. The Fleet Air Arm used Lossiemouth as a training station with pilots receiving their basic training there before moving to RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk) in Cornwall for instrument training. RAF Milltown also transferred to the FAA and became known as HMS Fulmar II. It operated as a Deck Landing Training School and it was here that the final stage of training was practised before students were allowed to land on  in the Moray Firth. The first FAA squadron, No. 766 Naval Air Squadron, arrived in August 1946 and predominately operated Supermarine Seafires and Fairey Fireflies until its departure to RNAS Culdrose in 1953. In order to replace poor quality war-era facilities, seven hundred new married living-quarters were constructed in Lossiemouth and Elgin in the late 1940s, with the first opening in September 1949. This arrangement differed from the RAF, who typically constructed living-quarters within their airfield boundaries. In 1952 and early 1953 Lossiemouth's runways were upgraded and extended to their present lengths and during that time aircraft temporarily operated from Milltown. On 28 March 1967 Blackburn Buccaneer planes from Lossiemouth bombed the shipwrecked supertanker  off the western coast of Cornwall to make the oil burn in order to avoid an environmental disaster.  On 13 November 1971, the Fairey Gannet 849 Naval Air Squadron was redeployed from RNAS Brawdy in Wales to Lossiemouth where it continued in service after the Fleet Air Arm handed the station back to the Royal Air Force on 28 September 1972. 'D' Flight, 202 Squadron, the Helicopter Search and Rescue Flight, was the first RAF unit to return. May 1973 saw the arrival of the Jaguar Conversion Team (renamed 226 Operational Conversion Unit on 1 October 1974) and in August 1973, 8 Squadron Avro Shackleton transferred to Lossiemouth from nearby RAF Kinloss. The Fleet Air Arm Fairey Gannets of 849 Squadron were retired from service in November 1978 and the squadron was disbanded. In December No. 48 Squadron RAF Regiment arrived to provide short-range defence with their Rapier surface-to-air missiles. In July 1979, 2622 (Highland) Royal Air Force Auxiliary Regiment was formed, tasked with the ground defence of the station. From 1978 to 1981, No. 2 Tactical Weapons Unit RAF flew Hawker Hunter from Lossiemouth prior to the reopening of RAF Chivenor. On 1 July 1991, the Shackletons of 8 Squadron retired from service and on 1 October 1991 237 Operational Conversion Unit was disbanded. In 1992 however, another unit was added to the station strength with the formation of 237 Field Squadron of the Territorial Army responsible for Airfield Damage Repair. This squadron became part of 76 Engineer Regiment (V) RE, responsible for ADR in the North and Scotland. Also during that year, the important links between RAF Lossiemouth and the District of Moray were further strengthened when the station formally received the Freedom of Moray. Major changes took place in 1993 with the Blackburn Buccaneer anti-shipping squadrons starting to be replaced by the Panavia Tornado. On 1 October, No.12(B) Squadron lost its Buccaneers but kept its squadron number-plate when re-equipped with Tornados. On 1 November, the Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit, renamed XV(Reserve) Squadron arrived from RAF Honington in Suffolk. In April 1994, 208 Squadron was disbanded and was replaced by 617 Squadron, which transferred with their Tornados from RAF Marham in Norfolk. Although 48 Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment left Lossiemouth for Honington on 1 July 1996, RAF Lossiemouth continued to be one of the busiest front-line stations in the RAF with 3 Tornado Squadrons, including XV(Reserve) Squadron, 16(Reserve) Squadron (previously 226 OCU) and 'D' Flight, 202 Squadron with their Sea Kings.  In July 2000, the Jaguars left for RAF Coltishall in Norfolk; however, with the increase in size of XV(Reserve) Squadron in 1999 following the closure of the Tri-national Tornado Training Establishment at RAF Cottesmore, the arrival of the Tornados of 14 Squadron from RAF Brüggen in January 2001, RAF Lossiemouth has become the busiest fast-jet station in the Royal Air Force. In May 2001, 51 RAF Regiment Squadron was reformed and now sits with 2622 Auxiliary Squadron under the newly formed 5 Force Protection Wing Headquarters at RAF Lossiemouth. Commercial spaceflight company Virgin Galactic announced in July 2006 that they were interested in using Lossiemouth as a spaceport, with the intention to start flights in 2010. Elected representatives for Moray, Angus Robertson MSP and Richard Lochhead MP lent their support to the proposals and held talks with the Scottish and UK Governments to promote the concept. After a two-year review looking at the potential of commercial spaceflight in the UK, the UK Space Agency announced in July 2014 that Lossiemouth was among eight shortlisted sites throughout the UK that could potentially accommodate a spaceport. However, in March 2015, the UK government ruled out Lossiemouth as well as nearby RAF Kinloss as candidates due to opposition from the Ministry of Defence, who cited overriding operational factors. The decision was criticised by local politicians.
