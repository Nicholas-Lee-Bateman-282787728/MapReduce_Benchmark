"The 54 percent population increase, according to residents and community leaders in Lakewood, was fueled by growth in the Jewish community, the Latino community and a third group, senior citizens. The town's African-American population, meanwhile, dropped slightly." Lakewood is one of the hubs of Orthodox Judaism and is home to one of the largest yeshivas in the world, Beth Medrash Govoha, which was founded by Rabbi Aharon Kotler. The large Orthodox population, comprising more than half the township's population, wields considerable political clout in the Township.U.S. gets another Orthodox mayor, Chicago Jewish Community Online, July 11, 2006. Accessed April 13, 2007. "Orthodox Jews make up nearly half of the village's 70,000 residents, and they often vote as a bloc, with a council of leaders determining whom they should support." The earliest documented European settlement of the present Lakewood area was by operators of sawmills, from about 1750 forward.  One such sawmill, located at the east end of the present Lake Carasaljo, was known as Three Partners Mill from at least 1789 until at least 1814.  From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-smelting operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local bog iron ore.  The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town.  In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880 it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort. Lakewood's developers thought that "Bricksburg" didn't capture their vision for the community, and the names "Brightwood" and "Lakewood" were proposed. After reaching out to area residents, "Lakewood" was chosen and the United States Postal Service approved the name in March 1880.History of Lakewood, VillageProfile.com. Accessed September 2, 2015. "Because the name of the town did not suit the visions its promoters had for it, Samuel D. Davis suggested the name 'Brightwood'. Erastus Dickinson suggested 'Lakewood' and the times and Journal conducted a house-to-house canvass of the citizens, who voted for 'Lakewood' by a large majority. On March 20, 1880, the Post Office officially recognized the name of the village as 'Lakewood.'"
