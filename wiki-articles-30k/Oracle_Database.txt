   Oracle Database (commonly referred to as Oracle RDBMS or simply as Oracle) is an object-relational database management system produced and marketed by Oracle Corporation. Larry Ellison and his two friends and former co-workers, Bob Miner and Ed Oates, started a consultancy called Software Development Laboratories (SDL) in 1977. SDL developed the original version of the Oracle software. The name Oracle comes from the code-name of a CIA-funded project Ellison had worked on while previously employed by Ampex. An Oracle database system—identified by an alphanumeric system identifier or SID—comprises at least one instance of the application, along with data storage. An instance—identified persistently by an instantiation number (or activation id: SYS.V_$DATABASE.ACTIVATION#)—comprises a set of operating-system processes and memory-structures that interact with the storage. (Typical processes include PMON (the process monitor) and SMON (the system monitor).) Oracle documentation can refer to an active database instance as a "shared memory realm".   Users of Oracle databases refer to the server-side memory-structure as the SGA (System Global Area). The SGA typically holds cache information such as data-buffers, SQL commands, and user information. In addition to storage, the database consists of online redo logs (or logs), which hold transactional history. Processes can in turn archive the online redo logs into archive logs (offline redo logs), which provide the basis (if necessary) for data recovery and for the physical-standby forms of data replication using Oracle Data Guard. If the Oracle database administrator has implemented Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters), then multiple instances, usually on different servers, attach to a central storage array. This scenario offers advantages such as better performance, scalability and redundancy. However, support becomes more complex, and many sites do not use RAC. In version 10g, grid computing introduced shared resources where an instance can use (for example) CPU resources from another node (computer) in the grid. The Oracle DBMS can store and execute stored procedures and functions within itself. PL/SQL (Oracle Corporation's proprietary procedural extension to SQL), or the object-oriented language Java can invoke such code objects and/or provide the programming structures for writing them. The Oracle RDBMS stores data logically in the form of tablespaces and physically in the form of data files ("datafiles").   Tablespaces can contain various types of memory segments, such as Data Segments, Index Segments, etc. Segments in turn comprise one or more extents. Extents comprise groups of contiguous data blocks. Data blocks form the basic units of data storage. A DBA can impose maximum quotas on storage per user within each tablespace.   The partitioning feature was introduced in Oracle 8. This allows the partitioning of tables based on different set of keys. Specific partitions can then be easily added or dropped to help manage large data sets. Oracle database management tracks its computer data storage with the help of information stored in the SYSTEM tablespace. The SYSTEM tablespace contains the data dictionary—and often (by default) indexes and clusters. A data dictionary consists of a special collection of tables that contains information about all user-objects in the database. Since version 8i, the Oracle RDBMS also supports "locally managed" tablespaces that store space management information in bitmaps in their own headers rather than in the SYSTEM tablespace (as happens with the default "dictionary-managed" tablespaces).  Version 10g and later introduced the SYSAUX tablespace, which contains some of the tables formerly stored in the SYSTEM tablespace, along with objects for other tools such as OEM, which previously required its own tablespace. Disk files primarily represent one of the following structures: At the physical level, data files comprise one or more data blocks, where the block size can vary between data files. Data files can occupy pre-allocated space in the file system of a computer server, utilize raw disk directly, or exist within ASM logical volumes.   Most Oracle database installations traditionally came with a default schema called SCOTT. After the installation process sets up sample tables, the user can log into the database with the username scott and the password tiger. The name of the SCOTT schema originated with Bruce Scott, one of the first employees at Oracle (then Software Development Laboratories), who had a cat named Tiger.Oracle FAQ Oracle Corporation now de-emphasizes the SCOTT schema, as it uses few features of more recent Oracle releases. Most  examples supplied by Oracle Corporation reference the default HR or OE schemas. Other default schemas include: Each Oracle instance uses a System Global Area or SGA—a shared-memory area—to store its data and control-information.  Each Oracle instance allocates itself an SGA when it starts and de-allocates it at shut-down time. The information in the SGA consists of the following elements, each of which has a fixed size, established at instance startup: Every Oracle database has one or more physical datafiles, which contain all the database data. The data of logical database structures, such as tables and indexes, is physically stored in the datafiles allocated for a database. Datafiles have the following characteristics: Data in a datafile is read, as needed, during normal database operation and stored in the memory cache of Oracle Database. For example, if a user wants to access some data in a table of a database, and if the requested information is not already in the memory cache for the database, then it is read from the appropriate datafiles and stored in memory. Modified or new data is not necessarily written to a datafile immediately. To reduce the amount of disk access and to increase performance, data is pooled in memory and written to the appropriate datafiles all at once. When you start the instance by using Enterprise Manager or SQL*Plus, the amount of memory allocated for the SGA is displayed.Karlsson André."Oracle DB Architecture - The Basics" The library cache stores shared SQL, caching the parse tree and the execution plan for every unique SQL statement. If multiple applications issue the same SQL statement, each application can access the shared SQL area. This reduces the amount of memory needed and reduces the processing-time used for parsing and execution planning. The data dictionary comprises a set of tables and  views that map the structure of the database. Oracle databases store information here about the logical and physical structure of the database. The data dictionary contains information such as: The Oracle instance frequently accesses the data dictionary to parse SQL statements. Oracle operation depends on ready access to the data dictionary—performance bottlenecks in the data dictionary affect all Oracle users. Because of this, database administrators must make sure that the data dictionary cache has sufficient capacity to cache this data. Without enough memory for the data-dictionary cache, users see a severe performance degradation. Allocating sufficient memory to the shared pool where the data dictionary cache resides precludes this particular performance problem. The Program Global Area  PGA Definition, Oracle Database Master Glossary  or PGA memory-area of an Oracle instance contains data and control-information for Oracle's server-processes. The size and content of the PGA depends on the Oracle-server options installed. This area consists of the following components: DBAs can monitor PGA usage via the system view. The dynamic performance views (also known as "fixed views") within an Oracle database present information from virtual tables (X$ tables)   built on the basis of database memory.    Database users can access the V$ views (named after the prefix of their synonyms) to obtain information on database structures and performance. The Oracle RDBMS typically relies on a group of processes running simultaneously in the background and interacting to monitor and expedite database operations. Typical operating environments might include - temporarily or permanently - some of the following individual processes (shown along with their abbreviated nomenclature):           transmits redo logs in Data Guard environments Safaribooksonline.com  Safaribooksonline.com           Oracle Database terminology distinguishes different computer-science terms in describing how end-users interact with the database: Oracle databases control simultaneous access to data resources with locks (alternatively documented as "enqueues").  The databases also utilize "latches" - low-level serialization mechanisms to protect shared data structures in the System Global Area. Oracle locks fall into three categories:   Database administrators control many of the tunable variations in an Oracle instance by means of values in a parameter file.  This file in its ASCII default form ("pfile") normally has a name of the format init.ora. The default binary equivalent server parameter file ("spfile") (dynamically reconfigurable to some extent) defaults to the format spfile.ora. Within an SQL-based environment, the views V$PARAMETER and V$SPPARAMETER give access to reading parameter values. The "Scheduler" (DBMS_SCHEDULER package, available from Oracle 10g onwards) and the Job subsystem (DBMS_JOB package) permit the automation of predictable processing.   Oracle Resource Manager aims to allocate CPU resources between users and groups of users when such resources become scarce.   Oracle Corporation stated in product announcements that manageability for DBAs had improved from Oracle9i to 10g. Lungu and Vătuiu (2008) assessed the relative manageability by performing common DBA tasks and measuring timings.    They performed their tests on a single Pentium CPU (1.7&nbsp;GHz) with 512&nbsp;MB RAM,running Windows Server 2000.  From Oracle9i to 10g, installation improved 36%, day-to-day administration 63%, backup and recovery 63%, and performance diagnostics and tuning 74%, for a weighted total improvement of 56%. The researchers concluded that "Oracle10g represents a giant step forward from Oracle9i in making the database easier to use and manage". Oracle Net Services allow client or remote applications to access Oracle databases via network sessions using various protocols. Oracle Database software comes in 63 language-versions (including regional variations such as British English and American English). Variations between versions cover the names of days and months, abbreviations, time-symbols (such as A.M. and A.D.), and sorting.  Oracle Corporation has translated Oracle Database error-messages into Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai and Turkish. Oracle Corporation provides database developers with tools and mechanisms for producing internationalized database applications: referred to internally as "Globalization".          for Linux, Solaris and Windows. (The c stands for "cloud".) Oracle Corporation releases Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) or Security Patch Updates (SPUs)   and Security Alerts to close security holes that could be used for data theft.Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Security Alerts come out quarterly on the Tuesday closest to 17th day of the month. Oracle products follow a custom release numbering and naming convention. With the Oracle RDBMS 10g release, Oracle Corporation began using the "10g" label in all versions of its major products, although some sources refer to Oracle Applications Release 11i as Oracle 11i. The suffixes "i", "g" and "c" do not actually represent a low-order part of the version number, as letters typically represent in software industry version numbering;  that is, there is no predecessor version of Oracle 10g called Oracle 10f. Instead, the letters stand for "internet", "grid" and "cloud", respectively.theregister.co.uk: Oracle gears up for infrastructure cloud and 12c database launches • The Register Consequently, many simply drop the "g" or "i" suffix when referring to specific versions of an Oracle product. Major database-related products and some of their versions include: Since version 2, Oracle's RDBMS release numbering has used the following codes: The version-numbering syntax within each release follows the pattern: major.maintenance.application-server.component-specific.platform-specific. For example, "10.2.0.1 for 64-bit Solaris" means: 10th major version of Oracle, maintenance level 2, Oracle Application Server (OracleAS) 0, level 1 for Solaris 64-bit. The Oracle Database Administrator's Guide offers further information on Oracle release numbers. Over and above the different versions of the Oracle database management software developed over time, Oracle Corporation subdivides its product into varying "editions" - apparently for marketing and license-tracking reasons. (Do not confuse the marketing "editions" with the internal virtual versioning "editions" introduced with Oracle 11.2).   In approximate order of decreasing functionality:   (SE) contains base database functionality. Oracle Corporation licenses this product on the basis of users or of processors, typically for servers running from one to four CPUs. If the number of CPUs exceeds 4 CPUs, the user must convert to an Enterprise license. SE has no memory limits, and can utilize clustering with Oracle RAC at no additional charge.   (SE1   or SEO), introduced with Oracle 10g, has some additional feature-restrictions. Unlike Standard Edition, Standard Edition One does not support Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) or Automatic Workload Management. See:   Oracle Corporation markets it for use on systems with one or two CPUs.   It has no memory limitations.   ("Oracle Database XE")   can support 11&nbsp;GB of user data.   Oracle XE does not support loading Java code into the database.     mobile database located on the mobile device can synchronize with a server-based installation.  Includes support for Win32, Windows CE, Palm OS, and EPOC database clients, integration with Oracle's Advanced Queuing (AQ) mechanism, and data- and application-synchronization software (for integration to enterprise Oracle databases). Supports 100% Java development (through JDBC drivers and the database's native support for embedded SQLJ and Java stored procedures). Prior to releasing Oracle 9i in 2001, Oracle Corporation ported its database product to a wide variety of platforms. Subsequently Oracle Corporation consolidated on a smaller range of operating-system platforms. , Oracle Corporation supported the following operating systems and hardware platforms for Oracle Database 11g (11.2.0.2.0):Oracle Database Online Documentation 11g Release 2 (11.2) In 2011, Oracle Corporation announced the availability of Oracle Database Appliance, a pre-built, pre-tuned, highly available clustered database server built using two SunFire X86 servers and direct attached storage. Some Oracle Enterprise edition databases running on certain Oracle-supplied hardware can utilize Hybrid Columnar Compression for more efficient storage.     analyzes database traffic on a network to prevent threats such as SQL injection.   Oracle Corporation refers to some extensions to the core functionality of the Oracle database as "database options". Oracle database options  In most cases, using these options entails extra licensing costs. See "Term licenses" at http://oraclestore.oracle.com/ for various markets/countries.     database options include:       (tracks and manages schema changes) Advanced Security  (adds public-key infrastructure security and data encryption methods - both for data at rest and for data on the network)     holding pluggable databases (PDBs) (from 12c)   In addition to its RDBMS, Oracle Corporation has released several related suites of tools and applications relating to implementations of Oracle databases. For example:   Apart from the clearly defined database options, Oracle databases may include many semi-autonomous software sub-systems, which Oracle Corporation sometimes refers to as "features" in a sense subtly different from the normal usage of the word. For example, Oracle Data Guard counts officially as a feature, but the command-stack within SQL*Plus, though a usability feature, does not appear in the list of "features" in Oracle's list. Such "features" may include (for example):   provided similar functionality.           "Virtual Private Database" appears listed as a feature available as part of Oracle Enterprise Edition in:   (VPD), an implementation of fine-grained access control.   Oracle Corporation classifies as "utilities" bundled software supporting data transfer, data maintenance and database administration.   Utilities included in Oracle database distributions include: For example:   Users can develop their own applications in Java and PL/SQL using tools such as:  Oracle Corporation had started a drive toward "wizard"-driven environments with a view to enabling non-programmers to produce simple data-driven applications.   The Database Upgrade Assistant (DBUA)   provides a GUI for the upgrading of an Oracle database.   JAccelerator (NCOMP) - a native-compilation Java "accelerator", integrates hardware-optimized Java code into an Oracle 10g database.   Oracle SQL Developer, a free graphical tool for database development, allows developers to browse database objects, run SQL statements and SQL scripts, and edit and debug PL/SQL statements. It incorporates standard and customized reporting. Oracle's OPatch provides patch management for Oracle databases.   The SQLTXPLAIN tool (or SQLT) provides tuning assistance for Oracle SQL queries.   Having acquired other technology in the database field, Oracle Corporation can also offer:   PL/SQL routines within Oracle databases can access external routines registered in operating-system shared libraries.   The Oracle RDBMS has had a reputation among novice users as difficult to install on Linux systems. Oracle Corporation has packaged  versions for several popular Linux distributions in an attempt to minimize installation challenges beyond the level of technical expertise required to install a database server. Users who have Oracle support contracts can use Oracle's "My Oracle Support" or "MOS"   web site - known as "MetaLink" until a re-branding exercise completed in October 2010. The support site provides users of Oracle Corporation products with a repository of reported problems, diagnostic scripts and solutions. It also integrates with the provision of support tools, patches and upgrades. The Remote Diagnostic Agent or RDA can operate as a command-line diagnostic tool executing a script. The data captured provides an overview of the Oracle Database environment intended for diagnostic and trouble-shooting. Within RDA, the HCVE (Health Check Validation Engine)  can verify and isolate host system environmental issues that may affect the performance of Oracle software. Oracle Corporation also endorses certain practices and conventions as enhancing the use of its database products. These include: The Oracle Certification Program, a professional certification program, includes the administration of Oracle Databases as one of its main certification paths. It contains three levels: A variety of official (Oracle-sponsored) and unofficial Oracle User Groups has grown up of users and developers of Oracle databases. They include: As of 2013 Oracle holds #1 DBMS market share worldwide based on the revenue share ahead of its four closest competitors - IBM , Microsoft, SAP and Teradata.[ ] ("Oracle Market Share") In the market for relational databases, Oracle Database competes against commercial products such as IBM's DB2 UDB and Microsoft SQL Server. Oracle and IBM tend to battle for the mid-range database market on UNIX and Linux platforms, while Microsoft dominates the mid-range database market on Microsoft Windows platforms. However, since they share many of the same customers, Oracle and IBM tend to support each other's products in many middleware and application categories (for example: WebSphere, PeopleSoft, and Siebel Systems CRM), and IBM's hardware divisions work closely with Oracle on performance-optimizing server-technologies (for example, Linux on z Systems). The two companies have a relationship perhaps best described as "coopetition". Niche commercial competitors include Teradata (in data warehousing and business intelligence), Software AG's ADABAS, Sybase, and IBM's Informix, among many others. In 2007, competition with SAP AG occasioned litigation from Oracle Corporation.About the case in Hungarian Increasingly, the Oracle database products compete against such open-source software relational database systems as PostgreSQL, Firebird, and MySQL. Oracle acquired Innobase, supplier of the InnoDB codebase to MySQL, in part to compete better against open source alternatives, and acquired Sun Microsystems, owner of MySQL, in 2010. Database products licensed as open source are, by the legal terms of the Open Source Definition, free to distribute and free of royalty or other licensing fees. Oracle Corporation offers term licensing for all Oracle products. It bases the list price for a term-license on a specific percentage of the perpetual license price. Prospective purchasers can obtain licenses based either on the number of processors in their target  machines or on the number of potential seats ("named users").   As computers running Oracle often have many multi-core processors (resulting in many cores, all to be licensed), the software price can rise into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The total cost of ownership often exceeds this, as large Oracle installations usually require experienced and trained database administrators to do the set-up properly. Furthermore, further components must be licensed and paid for, for instance the Enterprise Options used with the databases. Many licensing pitfalls let even rise the costs of ownership. Because of the product's large installed base and available training courses, Oracle specialists in some areas have become a more abundant resource than those for more exotic databases. Oracle frequently provides special training offers for database-administrators. On Linux, Oracle's certified configurations include Oracle's own Oracle Linux and other commercial Linux distributions (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5, SuSE SLES 8, 9, 10 and 11, Asianux), which can cost in a range from a few hundred to a few thousand USD per year (depending on processor architecture and the support package purchased). The Oracle database system can also install and run on freely available Linux distributions such as the Red Hat-based CentOS, or Debian-based systems.     , the database that costs the most per machine-processor among Oracle database editions, at $47,500 per processor.  The term "per processor" for Enterprise Edition is defined with respect to physical cores and a processor core multiplier (common processors = 0.5*cores).  e.g. An 8-processor, 32-core server using Intel Xeon 56XX CPUs would require 16 processor licenses. Cheaper: it can run on up to four processors but has fewer features than Enterprise Edition—it lacks proper parallelization,Oracle Database Licensing Information Database Editions etc.; but remains quite suitable for running medium-sized applications. There are not additional cost for Oracle RAC on the latest Oracle 11g R2 standard edition release. Sells even more cheaply, but remains limited to two CPUs. Standard Edition ONE sells on a per-seat basis with a five-user minimum. Oracle Corporation usually sells the licenses with an extra 22% cost for support and upgrades (access to My Oracle Support—Oracle Corporation's support site), which customers must renew annually. An addition to the Oracle database product family (beta version released in 2005, production version released in February 2006), offers a free version of the Oracle RDBMS, but one limited to 11&nbsp;GB of user data and to 1&nbsp;GB of memory used by the database (SGA+PGA).Licensing Restrictions XE will use no more than one CPU and lacks an internal JVM. XE runs on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and 64-bit Linux, but not on AIX, Solaris, HP-UX and the other operating systems available for other editions. Support is via a free Oracle Discussion Forum only. Data and index files: These files provide the physical storage of data, which can consist of the data-dictionary data (associated to the tablespace SYSTEM), user data, or index data. These files can be managed manually or managed by Oracle itself ("Oracle-managed files"). Note that a datafile has to belong to exactly one tablespace, whereas a tablespace can consist of multiple datafiles. Redo log files, consisting of all changes to the database, used to recover from an instance failure. Note that often a database will store these files multiple times, for extra security in case of disk failure. The identical redo log files are said to belong to the same group. Undo files: These special datafiles, which can only contain undo information, aid in recovery, rollbacks, and read-consistency. Archive log files: These files, copies of the redo log files, are usually stored at different locations. They are necessary (for example) when applying changes to a standby database, or when performing recovery after a media failure. It is possible to archive to multiple locations. Tempfiles: These special datafiles serve exclusively for temporary storage data (used for example for large sorts or for global temporary tables) Control file, necessary for database startup.

Datafiles can be defined to extend automatically when they are full. the redo log buffer: this stores redo entries—a log of changes made to the database. The instance writes redo log buffers to the redo log as quickly and efficiently as possible. The redo log aids in instance recovery in the event of a system failure. the shared pool: this area of the SGA stores shared-memory structures such as shared SQL areas in the library cache and internal information in the data dictionary.
