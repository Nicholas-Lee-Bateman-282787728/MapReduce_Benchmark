    Santos Futebol Clube (), commonly known as Santos or Peixe (), is a Brazilian professional football club based in Vila Belmiro, a bairro in the city of Santos. Despite being primarily a football club, Santos compete in a number of different sports, including American football, surfing, and even eSports. It plays in the Paulistão, the State of São Paulo's premier state league, as well as the Brasileirão, the top tier of the Brazilian football league system. Santos are one of the only five clubs to have never been relegated, along with São Paulo, Flamengo, Internacional and Cruzeiro. The club was founded in 1912 by the initiative of three sports enthusiasts from Santos by Raimundo Marques, Mário Ferraz de Campos, and Argemiro de Souza Júnior as a response to the lack of representation the city had in football. Since then, Santos became one of Brazil's most successful clubs, becoming a symbol of Jogo Bonito (English: the Beautiful Game) in football culture, hence the motto "Técnica e Disciplina" (Technique and discipline). The most recognized Santista anthem is the "Leão do Mar" written by Mangeri Neto. This was largely thanks to the Peixe's golden generation of the 1960s which contained players such as Gilmar, Mauro Ramos, Mengálvio, Coutinho, Pepe and Pelé, named the "Athlete of the Century" by the International Olympic Committee, and widely regarded among football historians, former players and fans to be the best and most accomplished footballer in the game's history. Os Santásticos, considered by some the best club team of all times, won a total of 24 titles during that decade including five consecutive Brasileirãos, a feat that remains unequaled until today. Os Santásticos also became the first squad in the world to win the Continental Treble, winning the Paulistão, the Brasileirão, and the Copa Libertadores in 1962. Santos is the most successful club in the Brasileirão, becoming national champions on eight occasions, a record they share with Palmeiras. It has also won 21 Paulistãos, three Copa Libertadores, two European/South American Cups, one Supercopa de Campeones Intercontinentales, one Copa CONMEBOL (the precursor of current Copa Sudamericana),Rsssf.comDiario On Line "Edición Nacional" one Copa do Brasil and one Recopa Sudamericana. In 1962, Santos became the first club in the world to win four out of four competitions in a single year, thus completing the quadruple, comprising the aforementioned treble and the European/South American Cup. On January 20, 1998, Santos became the first team, in any category in the world, to reach the milestone of 10,000 goals in the entire history of football, scored by Jorginho. The Peixe play their home games at the Vila Belmiro, which currently holds up to 20,120 spectators. Santos' regular kit is white shirts, with white shorts, accompanied by white socks. Nike are the kit manufacturers. Santos holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably against São Paulo, Palmeiras and Corinthians. It has contributed many key and famous players towards Brazil's FIFA World Cup squads, including eleven world champions out of its 45 contributors and two FIFA World Cup winning captains. In 2013, the club is the 2nd most valuable club in Brazil and Latin America, and 38th most valuable club in the world according to Brand Finance, worth over $65 million.[ ] In terms of revenue, Santos is Brazil's 4th richest sports club and one of the biggest football clubs in the world, generating an annual turnover of over $114 million in 2012.[ ]  In the beginning of the 20th century, the city of Santos grew to become of great importance to Brazil. Its port became one of the largest in the world with coffee, a major product in those times, being the most exported product. With the influx of income, the wealthy socialites of the city became increasingly interested in having the city represented in sports. Being a port, water sports such as rowing were generally the most practiced activity by the city's youth,  but the city had teams strong enough to compete in the Campeonatos Paulista or Paulistão, with Clube Atlético Internacional and Sport Club Americano being the two strongest representatives. Football was introduced to Santos in 1902 via the Instituto Presbiteriano Mackenzie, and the students created the two aforementioned clubs as a result. However, Atlético Internacional dissolved in 1910 and Americano moved to São Paulo in 1911. With the city students dissatisfied at this turn of events, a meeting was held at the headquarters of the Concordia Club (located in Rosario Street No. 18, at the top of the old bakery and Switzerland confectionery, currently Avenida João Pessoa), with the aim of creating a football team. The conference, which lasted 14 hours, was spearheaded by three sportsmen from the city: Raymundo Marques Francisco, Mário Ferraz de Campos and Argemiro de Souza Junior. During the meeting, there was doubt as to the name that should be given to the club. Several suggestions emerged: África Futebol Clube, Associação Esportiva Brasil, Concórdia Futebol Clube, among others. But the participants unanimously approved the proposal of Edmundo Jorge de Araujo: Santos Foot-Ball Club. Thus, the club was formally born on April 14, 1912, hours before the RMS Titanic sank into the Atlantic Ocean. As is commonly said, " One Giant sank into the ocean, and on the same day Another One was born". The club's first president was Sizino Patuska (who had participated in the founding of Atlético Internacional and was the founder of Americano).  The club's first practice match took place on June 23, 1912 at the Villa Macuco field, against a local club called Thereza. Santos won 2–1. The first Santista goal was scored by Anacleto Ferramenta da Silva, with Geraule Moreira Ribeiro adding another one later on. The first official match took place on September 15 of that same year, beating Santos Athletic Club 3–2. Arnaldo Silveira, one of the original founders of Santos, scored the first official goal of the club. The Alvinegro Praiano took part in their first Campeonato Paulista in 1913, being thrashed 8–2 by Germânia on June 1. Although Santos earned their first victory against Corinthians, a 3–6 away win at the Parque Antárctica (now known as the Estádio Palestra Itália), the 5–1 and 6–1 thumpings that Santos suffered at the hands of SC Internacional and Americano, respectively, and the high cost of travel, forced the team to abandon the tournament and make much needed improvements. However, in 1913 the Campeonato Santista was first played, with the Alvinegro earning their first ever title after winning all six matches, scoring 35 goals and conceding only seven. In 1914, due to an internal financial crisis, Santos only played friendly matches, winning all seven of them. In 1915, Santos changed their name temporarily to União Futebol Clube in order to compete in another city tournament due to budgeting reasons. Even so, Santos still went on to earn another title, their second in three years. With economic stability on hand, the Vila Belmiro sports park was inaugurated on October 12, 1916. That same year, Santos returned to compete in another Campeonato Paulista finishing in a much-improved 5th place. Between the 1917 and 1926 seasons, Santos was recognized as a solid and talented team, but one that could not offer a true challenge for the state title, finishing no higher than fourth place. That changed in 1927 when the tradition of the Alvinegro became defined during the 1920s: the discovery and creation of young talent. The team, known as O ataque dos 100 gols (English: The 100-goal attackers), was led by the first major club idol, Araken Patusca, son of the first president of Santos. With the Araken Patusca was the first Santista to participate in a World Cup, as a member of the Brazilian national team squad in the FIFA World Cup in 1930, the first World Cup. He played one match against Yugoslavia.according to most sources, including the RSSSF, the Santos Futebol Clube official web site, and Sambafoot.com. FIFA does not list him in the starting lineup or as reserve in the official match report, but contemporary newspapers do: they criticized the performance of Araken against Yugoslavia, saying "Araken played like a dancer". Santos finished as runners-up in 1927, 1928 and 1929, scoring 100 goals in 16 games in the 1927 season, resulting in an incredible rate of 6.25 goals per match. The milestone of 100 goals was a result of work characteristics that later would become an excerpt in the official anthem of the club: Técnica e Disciplina (English: Technique and Discipline). Santos entered a period of irregular campaigns, coinciding with the club's transition to professionalism; in 1933 the president of Santos publicly declared Santos a professional side for the first time.  This was followed by the club's first great success in 1935. During that season, the club prepared heavily for the Paulistão with 14 friendlies, winning seven, losing four and drawing three matches. The 10-1 thrashing of Espanha at the hands of Santos provided the highlight of its preseason preparations. On the last match of the state competition, Santos defeated Corinthians 2–0 at the Estádio Parque São Jorge, Corinthians' home ground at the time, to win their first state title ever, thanks to goals by Raul and an experienced Araken Patusca. This historic consecration sealed Santos' first major title and paved the way for future generations to follow. Although Santos failed to retain the state title next season, the club remained undefeated in international matches during the 1930s, with seven wins and one draw. The most overwhelming win occurred against the French national football team, who arrived at Santos on July 30 after the FIFA World Cup in Uruguay and decided to use the stop to play against a local team, handidly losing 6-1 with four goals from Feitiço. Claiming they faced the Seleção rather than the club, the suspicious French were invited to the clubhouse to prove that the team that had just faced them was not the Brazilian team in disguise.[ ] Following their triumph in the 1935 Paulistão, many key players of the winning squad left or retired soon afterwards, depleting the club of its veterans. Santos would finish in 4th place in their failed attempt to defend the state title in 1936. Patusca's departure in 1937 proved to be the closing chapter of his generation and the beginning of dismal campaigns in the Paulista tournament for the following 10 years, finishing no higher than 5th place.  However, Santos' fortunes changed when former goalkeeper Athié Jorge Cury became club president in 1946 and immediately sought out to reconquer the state title. After getting the club's finances in order, he sanctioned a tour into the Brazilian northern and northeastern regions to face the top teams in Belém, Fortaleza, Natal and Recife, among other cities, and give the upcoming generation much needed experience. Santos soundly defeated many of the regions' top clubs such as Paysandu, Fortaleza EC, ABC, Santa Cruz, etc. Led by the club's second chronological idol Antoninho, the club went on undefeated in what was, until then, the longest football trip any Brazilian club has taken. It lasted from November 29, 1946 to February 2, 1947 with Santos obtaining 12 wins and three draws. The leading goal-scorers of the tour were Caxambu, with 19 goals, and Adolfrise, scoring 18. The club managed to finish in 2nd place in the 1948 edition of the Paulistão, thanks to Antoninho, Pinho and Odair dos Santos. Odair become the club's season topscorer with 20 goals; he will repeat this feat for the following three seasons. Odair and Antoninho would also help the club finish 3rd in the 1950 edition of the state competition. This was the first time Santos had two top-three finishes in three seasons in the Paulistão since the O ataque dos 100 gols generation. Santos also participated in the Torneio Rio – São Paulo for the first time in 1952, finishing in third place overall. The arrivals of younger prospects such as Formiga, Manga, Tite, Zito and Vasconcelos coincided with the retirements of Odair and Antoninho in 1952 and 1953 respectively, ensuring the club had the quality to maintain its pursuit on the State championship. Antoninho would become the club's assistant manager in 1954 with Lula becoming the club's manager that same year.  It was in 1955 when Santos finished building its base and establishments that would make it a success in the future. Despite starting that year's Paulistão with a mediocre 0-0 draw against Noroeste, the club would go on to remain undefeated for the first 11 matches in the competition which included a 7-1 victory over Jabaquara, the heaviest defeat they would inflict in that competition's edition. A 4-2 defeat to Guarani and an 8-0 drumming by Portuguesa brought setbacks and instability. A 3-1 loss to São Paulo and consecutive losses to São Bento and Corinthians put the club's aspirations to the state title in danger. However, the club's strong team spirit, the goals of Emanuele Del Vecchio, its relatively stable campaign and the 2-1 victory over Taubaté, Santos' last match in the competition, ensured the club would win their second state title ever, the first in 20 years. Del Vecchio's 38 goals were the club's highest season tally since Patusca's 53 in 1927. He was also the Paulistãos' top scorer with 23 goals. An infamous club anthem, "Leão do Mar", was created in order to commemorate this triumph. In order to build upon the moment and provide a capable defense of the state title, Cury set in motion a series of plans and contracts after predicting that several of its veterans might opt to leave the club in a repeat of the aftermath in 1935. He  secured the services of several established players such as Zito. Cury also invested to keep several young potentials like Pepe and the upcoming Pagão. The club president also gave Lula leeway to scout talented individuals who were trying out for the club. Perhaps the greatest signing Cury approved of was that of a 15-year-old boy brought over to Vila Belmiro by Waldemar de Brito. De Brito, who was a manager of Bauru Atlético Clube's junior squad, won three consecutive São Paulo state youth championships between 1954 and 1956 with the child. The boy, called Edson Arantes do Nascimento and who would be better known as Pelé in the near future, was the main driving force behind those victories. The contract between Santos and the young Pelé was finalized in June 1956.  After 50 years Santos began to be seen as the best team in the world. When Pelé made his debut in the Campeonato Paulista in 1957, the team was already twice state champion (1955/56). The King had as fellow players Zito, Pagão, Formiga, Hélvio, Jair da Rosa Pinto, Urubatão, Tite and Pepe. Therefore, it is true that Santos were lucky to have Pelé. He was also fortunately only just beginning his career at Santos. Santos won the third state title in 50 years, the magical year of 1958 – in which Brazil became world champion in Sweden, with Zito Santos, Pelé and Pepe,  and won in spectacular fashion. The team scored 143 goals in 38 games, averaging 3.76 per game. Only 40 goals were scored against them. Pelé set a record that has never been equaled in any state competition in the country : he scored no less than 58 goals, an astonishing total for one player. Traditional rivals were massacred in 1958, particularly 10–0 against the Nacional. In addition to state titles, the Santos won the Rio-São Paulo in 1959, beating Vasco in the final by 3–0 with two goals by Coutinho when a lad of 16. Coutinho also scored five goals against Ponte Preta, and Santos won the game by 12–1 even without Pelé.  No other team had a prevalence in Brazilian football as great as Santos in the 1960s. The club won eight titles: six Brazilian Championships (five Taça Brasil and one Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa), two Copas Libertadores, two Intercontinental Cups, three Rio-São Paulo, a South American Recopa, a World and numerous international tournaments. A poll in the magazine El Gráfico saw dozens of experts from South America and Europe choose as the world champion best team of all time the Santos side of 1962/63, whose time-base was formed by Gylmar, Lima, Mauro, Calvet and Dalmo; Mengálvio and Zito, Dorval, Coutinho, Pele and Pepe. Coach: Luis Alonso Perez, Lula. In demand worldwide, Santos became the first globetrotting football team and played exhibition matches in dozens of countries. A war in Africa was stopped so that the two sides could see Pelé's team play. Under pressure from the CBD (Brazilian Sport Confederation), which the team did not want to risk their star players in unsafe stadiums in South America, Santos did not participate in the editions of the Libertadores 1966, 1967 and 1969. Players from Santos and Botafogo formed the basis of the Brazilian World Cup sides in Chile (1962) and Mexico (1970). On two occasions – against Germany and England – the national team had eight Santos players in the team. In six games of qualifying for the 1970 World Cup "The beasts of the Saldanha" played with six Santos players : Carlos Alberto, Djalma Dias, Joel Campbell, Rildo, Pelé and Edu. The influence of Santos was so great that the defense played with the national team the same numbers that were used at Santos: right-back with the shirt 4, right center-back with the second, left center-back with the sixth and left-back with three. Finally, left-winger Antônio Simões, Benfica and Portugal said: "I compare the Santos 62 team with the national team of Brazil in 70. These are the two best football teams I have ever seen. The 70 side is the confirmation of a game model that Santos already demonstrated long ago." State champion in 1973, still with Pelé in the team, and again in 1978, driven by the amazing Pita Boys Town, Juary, João Paulo and Nilton Batata, the Santos of the 1970s were no longer just appreciated for the refinement of their football and became a symbol of passion and rapture. Their fans, who for a long time could not compete with the teams of the capital, steadily grew in number and started to compete with the massive Morumbi crowd, and significantly passed São Paulo and Palmeiras. When it seemed that the fate of the club would be hopelessly compromised by debt made millions for the purchase of the luxurious Spa Park, Santos came back to be only eleven shirts who fought and drew crowds. In one of the worst moments of its history, which resulted in the loss of the Spa Park and all that was invested in him, Santos rose a charismatic worship, which had its greatest asset in his legions of fans. The period began with the Santos became vice-champion São Paulo of 1980, and, interestingly, the executioner of this final Santos – São Paulo fan striker Serginho – is who would become the idol of the decade Santos. Passionate team Belmiro since childhood, the irascible Sérgio Bernardino only felt at home when he was hired by President Milton Teixeira to the team that would dispute the Brazilian 1993. Opportunist, kicking strong and big stamina, Serginho was the terror of the defenses that the Brazilian Championship and became the top scorer with 22 goals. The team took the runner-up, to win in São Paulo, Rio lose and be overtaken on goal for Flamengo. Ms joy did not come in Brazil did not take long. The following year the team became champion São Paulo in a rally-point competition, ending the dream of reaching the third championship Corinthians. In the decisive game of ecstasy to Santos, the team won by Corinthians 1–0, Serginho goal in the second half. Santos striker was again the top scorer, this time tied with Chiquinho, Botafogo, with 16 goals.  In the 1990s Santos won only two tiles: the Rio – São Paulo Tournament in 1997 and the Copa CONMEBOL in 1998. In the final of the national Championship of 1995, Santos faced Botafogo, but could not beat the team from Rio de Janeiro the Santos's stars in 1995. For fans of Santos, the outcome determined by the referee, who cancelled a supposedly valid goal by Camanducaia and allowed Botafogo striker Túlio Maravilha to score while in an offside position. The new chairman Marcelo Teixeira, son of former chairman Milton Teixeira, tried to prepare Santos for domination in the 21st century. No expense was spared to build a complete squad, with names as Rincón, Marcelinho Carioca, Edmundo, Marcio Santos, Carlos Germano, Valdo and Galván. Those big names could not translate their reputation into excellence on the pitch, resulting in a runner-up and a semi-final loss in the state championships of 2000 and 2001. In the national league Santos performed sub-par, with an 18th place in 2000 and a 15th in 2001. By 2002 the big names had left and financial space was narrow. Santos looked at their youth squads for reinforcements, hoping they could prevent a worse campaign leading to relegation. The new head coach Emerson Leão would prove he could do much more. In a more than reasonable campaign Santos finished eighth in the regular season and thus qualified for the play-offs. In the quarter finals, the São Paulo of the young Kaká and Luis Fabiano was eliminated over two legs, and in the semi-finals Grêmio was effectively knocked out with a 3–0 victory in Vila Belmiro. With Robinho and Diego as the most important of Meninos da Vila, Corinthians was beaten in both of the final legs and thus Santos conquered its seventh national championship. The pedalada, one of the most disseminated tricks nowadays, was popularized by Robinho in the final match. In 2003 Santos came second in the first ever Brazilian national championship without a post-season play-off to determine the champion. The next year Santos returned to glory, however. In a year where fans felt their team was being intentionally hampered by referees, lost the right to play in its own stadium on various occasions, and the kidnapping of Robinho's mother, Santos had an impressive campaign. Only two matches before the end of the competition Santos was able to surpass Atlético Paranaense, who had been on top of the table for the majorit of the season. In the last match Santos did not crumble and beat Vasco da Gama 2–1 for its eighth title. With Robinho, Léo, Deivid and manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo leaving Santos in 2005, the team was unable to win more titles that year. Despite leading figures leaving, Santos was headed for a sixth-place finish until the Zveitão. Upon discovery that referee Edilson Pereira de Carvalho participated in manipulating results, all matches he led were played over again. Santos' 4–2 win against Corinthians thus became a 2–3 loss, which meant Santos dropped to the 11th place and gave its rival, Corinthians, the championship at cost of Internacional. In 2006 Santos was fourth in Brazil, securing itself a spot in the Copa Libertadores, and won the Paulista Championship for the first time since 1984. In 2007 Santos lost its first match only in the first leg of the final yet winning the title through a second leg victory nonetheless. In the national championship Santos led the team to second place, 15 points behind champion São Paulo. With again various big names leaving, 2008 proved to be a troublesome year for Santos. Only thanks to a comeback in the last few games was relegation avoided. In 2008 Santos played Copa Libertadores again. They endured until quarter-finals, when they were beaten by America (Mexico). With a recurrence of financial problems, Santos recruited young players. In 2009, Neymar and Paulo Henrique Ganso joined the professional team. Neymar signed with the team when he was 13. Ganso came from Paysandu, a northern team, when he was 15. They started to play together and developed a very strong bond. In 2010, they led a great team, which is the base of the actual squad. The team that won Campeonato Paulista this year was formed by: Felipe; Pará, Edu Dracena, Durval and Léo; Wesley, Arouca and Ganso; Neymar, André, and the repatriated Robinho. They also won Copa do Brasil 2010, beating Vitória in the finals, but with an overwhelming campaign. For example, they beat Naviraiense 10–0, which gave them the status of Santástico (Santos + Fantastic) again. This team is also known for the irreverent game style and the dancing celebrations. 2011 was also a good year for the club. It raised its revenue with marketing and rights, mainly because of Neymar's success. Santos traded away some players from the previous year's team, but maintained some of the main players. Also, some other named players came from Europe to Peixe's squad, like Elano, Alan Kardec and Ibson. This year Santos won the Campeonato Paulista, beating two of its biggest rivals, São Paulo and Corinthians. The main team was formed by: Rafael Cabral; Danilo, Edu Dracena, Durval, Léo; Arouca, Adriano, Elano, Ganso; Neymar and Borges. This team also won the Copa Libertadores, beating Peñarol (Uruguay) in the finals. In December, Santos traveled to Japan and finished in the second position in the FIFA Club World Cup, beaten by Barcelona (4–0). In 2012 Santos kept the two title per year ratio, winning the State Championships (Paulistão) against Guarani and the Recopa against Universidad de Chile. The team started to fragmentate, and saw the departures of Ganso (São Paulo), Borges (Cruzeiro), Elano (Grêmio) and other key players. 2013 marked the end of the latest Santástico era. Without achieving the fourth Paulistão in a row (runner-up), the eventual negotiations and departure of Neymar (negotiated with Barcelona), the coach Muricy Ramalho and the goalkeeper Rafael Cabral (Napoli) ended up leaving Santos as a shadow of its latest victorious installment. Santos ended the 2013 season in 7th place and had the best finish of any team from the state of São Paulo. At the end of the season, interim manager Claudinei Oliveira was let go of by the club on mutual terms and Santos hired Oswaldo de Oliveira to begin in 2014. In 2014, Santos began the year competing in the Paulistão and completing several signings, including the most expensive player ever bought by Santos, Leandro Damião. On 1 February Gabriel scored Santos' 12000th goal in a 5–1 routing over Botafogo-SP. Despite playing an enthusiastic football during the tournament (also being the most effective attack), Santos was defeated in the final round by fourth division side Ituano on penalty kicks, eventually finishing runner-up. On September 2, 2014, Oswaldo de Oliveira was released by the Santos board and replaced the next day by Enderson Moreira. Santos finished 9th in the year's Brasileirão, and on 13 December 2014, Modesto Roma Júnior was elected the new president, after winning by 1,329 votes. The club also suffered with several financial troubles from the previous management, led by Odílio Rodrigues, and saw Damião, Arouca, Aranha and Eugenio Mena take legal actions against the club due to unpaid wages. In 2015, due to the club's financial problems, free agents Elano and Ricardo Oliveira returned to Santos with a low wage, and the club also loaned out Damião (the most expensive player of the previous campaign). On 5 March, despite the club's unbeaten status, Enderson Moreira was sacked. Marcelo Fernandes was appointed manager shortly after, winning the year's Paulistão. After a poor start in the Brasileirão, Dorival Júnior returned to the club after five years, taking it to the finals of 2015 Copa do Brasil and returning to G-4 after more than 130 rounds. The first colors chosen for the new club were white, azure blue and golden lemon as an homage to Concórdia Club. But the difficulty to fabricate the colors on the uniform during those times forced a board meeting a year after the club's foundation. Pelúcio Paul suggested switching the official colors to white and black. According to Paul, the color white represents peace and black represents nobility. It received wide approval from the club members and the president of Santos, Raymundo Marques, based the club on the new colors. Since the club's foundation, Santos have had eight main crests, though all underwent minor variations. In 1912, Santos adopted a black and white striped shield, with one of the early leather footballs in the middle and a diagonal band with the letters "SFBC". In order to pay homage to Concórdia Club (who let Santos use their headquarters to plan its foundation), the club used a crest that incorporated three golden lemon letters, the letters S, F and C, in the center of an azure blue circle. At the end of 1912, the crest was remade with a white band around the circle. The white band was surrounded by a golden lemon border. The letters were colored white with golden lemon serving as its outside borders. Due to the difficulty of creating these colors consistently, the crest was rebranded to a white badge with black borders and the letters 'SFC' colored black. Later in 1913, the crest was redesigned as a badge inside a globe showing longitude and latitude lines as well as the equator. The badge had a black, diagonal band with "S.F.C." in white text. The top half above the band was white with a leather ball at the top left corner. The bottom half was a black and white striped background. Above the badge was a crown. During 1915, the club temporarily changed its name to União Futebol Clube and were forced to create a temporary crest for that year. The crest was an escutcheon with a white band that read 'União F.C.' and a black background. In 1925, the globe and crown were removed from the crest and it took its future form, only going through a remodelling in 2005. Like many major football clubs around the world, Santos is sponsored by many corporations. Since 1979, Santos has had 38 different sponsors, with Rainha being the club's first kit manufacturer. Casas Bahia, a Brazilian retail chain which specializes in furniture and home appliances, became the first sponsor for the Peixe. The club is currently primarily sponsored by Kappa. The team has also many sponsors that invest in the club as well. Many of those are nationally based but have expanded to other nations. The current sponsors are UNICEF (a United Nations program), Corr Plastik (a company specializes in pipes and fittings), Brahma (the second best-selling beer in Brazil and one of the ten largest in the world), Voxx Suplementos (a Brazilian suplements line) and Royal Air Maroc (a Moroccan airline).   Soon after its foundation, Santos held their training in a field located in the district of Macuco. As the pitch did not meet the minimum size standards to dispute official matches, Santos played on the "Igreja Coração de Maria" pitch in Ana Costa Avenue. The field, however, was also used by other clubs in town. In 1915, the situation reached its breaking point, when Santos had constant conflicts with other city clubs on when the field could be used, forcing the club to reject several requests for international friendlies. To solve the problem, the leaders began searching for land in the city. On May 31, 1916, a general assembly approved the purchase of an area of 16,500 square meters, in the neighborhood of Vila Belmiro. On October 12 of that year, the inauguration of the Vila Belmiro sports park. The first game was held 10 days later, against Ypiranga for the 1916 Campeonato Paulista which Santos won 2–1. Adolfo Millon Jr. scored the first ever goal on that stadium. The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 32,989 in a 0–0 draw between Santos and Corinthians for the 1964 Campeonato Paulista. Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations. The last change was a new illumination system being installed on January 27, 1998, with an illumnination level of 1200 lux, more than the FIFA minimum recommendation. The Vila Belmiro was one of the venues of the 1949 Copa América, hosted the 1962 Copa Libertadores final and the 1998 Copa CONMEBOL final. It has also hosted a Copa do Brasil final in 2010. Due to its relative-low capacity, Santos has used other stadiums for high-profile matches such as the Estádio Palestra Itália, Pacaembu and Morumbi, all located in São Paulo, and the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro. Current Santos President Luis Alvaro Ribeiro and other club directors are agreeing on building a stadium in a city nearby Santos called Cubatao, a stadium for 40,000 people which would become Santos' home field for almost 70% of the games during the season which would increase the team's profit. In October 2005, the Centro de Treinamento Rei Pelé was inaugurated. Located in the Jabaquara neighborhood, the training ground, one of the most modern in Brazil, includes medical and training facilities for the first team and a hotel, "Recanto dos Alvinegros". The Centro de Treinamento Meninos da Vila, located in the Saboó neighborhood, constitutes two fields of equal size to the Vila Belmiro and it is intended for the training and development of players. The two fields are named in homage to the revelation of players Diego and Robinho. It was inaugurated in August 2006.  The core strength of Santos's global brand is often attributed to Lula's success in leading Os Santasticos, which drew worldwide acclaim. The iconic team included Gilmar, Mauro, Mengálvio, Coutinho, Pepe and Pelé.
