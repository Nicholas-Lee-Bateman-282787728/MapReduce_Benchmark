     Corby is a town and borough located in the county of Northamptonshire, England. It is located  north-east of the county town, Northampton. The borough had a population of 61,300 at the 2011 Census. Figures released in March 2010 revealed that Corby has the fastest growing population in both Northamptonshire and the whole of England. The Borough of Corby borders onto the Borough of Kettering, the District of East Northamptonshire, the District of Harborough and the unitary authority county of Rutland. The town was at one time known locally as "Little Scotland" due to the large number of Scottish migrant workers who came to Corby for its steelworks. Recently, Corby has undergone a large regeneration process with the opening of Corby railway station and Corby International Pool in 2009 and the Corby Cube Building opening in 2010. This is home to Corby Borough Council and is a large 450 seat theatre.http://www.corby.gov.uk The Borough of Corby consists of the town of Corby, as well as the villages of Weldon, Rockingham, Gretton, Cottingham, Middleton, East Carlton, Stanion and Little Stanion. Mesolithic and Neolithic artefacts have been found in the area surrounding Corby and human remains dating to the Bronze Age were found in 1970 at Cowthick.An Archaeological Resource Assessment of the Neolithic and Bronze Age in Northamptonshire  The first evidence of permanent settlement comes from the 8th century when Danish invaders arrived and the settlement became known as "Kori's by"&nbsp;– Kori's settlement. The settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as "Corbei". Corby's emblem, the raven, derives from an alternative meaning of this word. These Danish roots were recognised in the naming of the most southern of the town's housing estates, Danesholme, around which one of the Danish settlements was located. Corby was granted the right to hold two annual fairs and a market by Henry III in 1226. In 1568 Corby was granted a charter by Elizabeth I that exempted local landowners from tolls (the fee paid by travellers to use the long distance public roads), dues (an early form of income tax)Corby Borough Council - The History of Corby  and gave all men the right to refuse to serve in the local militia. A popular legend is that the Queen was hunting in Rockingham Forest when she (dependent on the legend) either fell from her horse or became trapped in a bog whilst riding. Upon being rescued by villagers from Corby she granted the charter in gratitude for her rescue. Another popular explanation is that it was granted as a favour to her alleged lover Sir Christopher Hatton. The Corby Pole Fair is an event that has taken place every 20 years since 1862 in celebration of the charter. According to a newspaper report dated 14 June 1862 which focuses on the extravagances of the Fair, the fugitive slave John Anderson was described as being educated in the Corby British School,Corby Pole Fair. | Northampton Mercury | Saturday 14 June 1862. British Newspaper Archive. Retrieved on 17 July 2013. giving the town an unusual link to slavery in the United States. The next pole fair is to be held in 2022. The local area has been worked for iron ore since Roman times. An ironstone industry developed in the 19th century with the coming of the railways and the discovery of extensive ironstone beds. By 1910 an ironstone works had been established. In 1931 Corby was a small village with a population of around 1,500. It grew rapidly into a reasonably sized industrial town, when the owners of the ironstone works, the steel firm Stewarts & Lloyds, decided to build a large integrated ironstone and steel works on the site. The start of construction in 1934 drew workers from all over the country including many workers from the depressed west of Scotland and Irish labourers. The first steel was produced in October 1935 and for decades afterwards the steel works dominated the town. By 1939 the population had grown to around 12,000, at which time Corby was thought to be the largest "village" in the country, but it was at that point that Corby was re-designated an urban district (see the Local Government section below). During World War II the Corby steelworks were expected to be a target for German bombers but in the event there were only a few bombs dropped by solitary planes and there were no casualties. This may be because the whole area was blanketed in huge dense black, low-lying clouds created artificially by the intentional burning of oil and latex to hide the glowing Bessemer converter furnaces at the steelworks from German bomber crews. The only known remaining scars from German attacks can be found in the form of bullet holes visible on the front fascia of the old post office in Corby village (now known as Decades bar and restaurant). Nobody really knows the exact circumstances under which the attack occurred, but a local apocryphal tale tells of a lone pilot making his way back to Germany after a successful raid on Coventry who spotted some lights so decided to finish off his already depleted stock of bullets. Sadly, the authenticity of this romanticised tale can neither be verified or denied, but it is certainly the most popular theory among locals. The Corby steelworks made a notable contribution to the war effort by manufacturing the steel tubes used in Operation Pluto (Pipe Line Under the Ocean) to supply fuel to Allied forces on the European continent. In 1950, with a population of 18,000, Corby was designated a New Town with William Holford as its architect. By 1951, he prepared the development plan with a car-friendly layout and many areas of open space and woodland. In 1952, Holford produced the town centre plan and in 1954 the layout for the first 500 houses. The town now underwent its second wave of expansion, mainly from Scotland. In 1967 the British steel industry was nationalised and the Stewarts & Lloyds steel tube works at Corby became part of British Steel. In 1973 the government approved a strategy of consolidating steel making in five main areas – South Wales, Sheffield, Scunthorpe, Teesside and Scotland – most of which are coastal sites with access to economic supplies of iron rich imported ores. Thus in 1975 Harold Wilson's Labour government agreed a programme that would lead to the phasing-out of steel making in Corby. By the end of 1981 over 5,000 jobs had been lost from British Steel in Corby, and further cuts took the total loss to 11,000 jobs, leading to an unemployment rate of over 30%.The State of the Regions, Local Government Information Unit Steel tube making continued, however, initially being supplied with steel by rail from Teesside and later from South Wales. New industry was subsequently attracted to the town when the Thatcher government designated it as an Enterprise Zone. By 1991 unemployment had returned to the national average.Corby Northamptonshire through time - Historical Statistics on Work and Poverty The recovery of Corby was explained in 1990 by John Redwood, then a junior minister in the Department of Trade and Industry, as being a result of the establishment of the Enterprise Zone, the promotion of Corby by the Thatcher government, the work of private investors and the skills of the work force. Others believe the town's recovery was significantly assisted by its central location and substantial grants from the EU. To the north of Corby, on the industrial estates, is a 350MW power station built in 1994; and the Rockingham Motor Speedway built in 2001. The Corby constituency contains parts of traditionally Conservative East Northamptonshire that balance the traditionally Labour town of Corby leading to a marginal constituency that has gone to the party forming the national government in every general election since the creation of the constituency in 1983. In the 2005 General Election, Labour won Corby by a majority of just over 1,000. At the 2010 general election, the sitting Labour MP Phil Hope lost the seat to writer Louise Bagshawe, the Conservative Party candidate, who became Louise Mensch after her marriage the following year. In 2012, Mensch resigned as an MP and the resulting by-election was won by Labour's Andy Sawford with a majority of 7,791 over the Conservatives. UKIP came in third place whilst the Liberal Democrats came fourth, losing their deposit. The by-election was of national and international media interest due the constituency being a marginal seat. During the wait for the results announcement, "Corby" briefly trended worldwide on Twitter. The Conservatives took back the Corby constituency from Labour in 2015, with Conservative Tom Pursglove defeating Labour's Andy Sawford by a majority of 2,412. In local politics, Corby Borough Council has been controlled by the Labour party since 1979. In 2015 the council had 24 Labour representatives and 5 Conservatives. The town's Labour administration is led by Councillor Tom Beattie, a Unite Union representative. The Corby Conservatives are led by lawyer Councillor Rob McKellar. On 8 December 2014, Northamptonsire Police began an investigation into financial dealings by Corby Borough Council. In July 2013, Conservative councillors Rob McKellar and David Sims handed the "suspicious" findings of an audit report to the police to see if a crime had been committed. The audit report examined four major projects, including the Corby Cube, the cost of which went from £35m to £47m.BBC News 8 December 2014, Accessed 8 December 2014  In 2012, Corby bid to gain city status as part of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.Stratford, John.

Scottish migration to Corby has created a unique population in the borough, evidenced most clearly in the 'Corby accent',Anecdotal evidence suggests that the local accent of the steel town of Corby, Northamptonshire (in the heart of England), sounds typically Scottish as a result of the overwhelmingly Scottish origin of the work-force.  Page 23 in Wells, John C. (1982), Accents of English I: An Introduction, Cambridge, New York: Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-29719-2 which is often described as sounding Glaswegian. The link with Scotland is a strong feature of the area: according to the 2001 Census, there were 10,063 Scottish-born in the Corby Urban Area&nbsp;– 18.9% of the population. A further 1.3 per cent were born in Northern Ireland. It has been estimated that a further third of the population are Scottish or of Scottish descent.   The Scottish heritage is cherished by many inhabitants. There are Scottish social and sporting clubs and there are many fervent supporters of the Rangers and Celtic football clubs (indeed, Corby was home to the largest Rangers Supporters' Club outside Glasgow and Northern Ireland until its closure in February 2013) as well as the Scottish National Team. Many shops sell Scottish foods and a supermarket even introduced Gaelic signs to their Corby store (but they have since removed them). An annual Highland Gathering featuring traditional Scottish sports, music and dancing is held in the town. Corby is the only town in England apart from London with two Church of Scotland churches.Church of Scotland - Presbytery of England  Local legend states that Corby sees the highest sales of the Scottish soft drink Irn-Bru of anywhere outside Scotland. Asda Corby is stated to sell 17 times more Irn-Bru than any other store in England.http://www.louisemensch.net/10062010_maiden_speech Asda Corby Celebrates Burns Night.

In 2014, Corby held a mock referendum in the run up to the Scottish independence referendum. 576 votes were cast, with 162 voting for Scottish independence and 414 voting against.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-28279790 The song Steeltown by Big Country (title track of the album) was written about the town of Corby, telling how many Scots went to work there, but found themselves unemployed when the steelworks declined. (Source: Melody Maker, 1984) According to the 2001 Census 1.7% of the population are non-white and the average age of the population (37.2) is slightly lower than the average for England and Wales (38.6). November 2010 saw the opening of the Corby Cube, a major development in the town centre. As well as new council chamber, registrar office, and public library, the Cube is home to a 450-seat theatre and 100 capacity studio theatre. A programme of live theatre, dance, music and standup comedy is complemented by a participation programme encouraging all parts of Corby community to get involved. Recently the theatre started screening films, twice a week and including current mainstream releases and the best in world, independent and art house cinema. A report in 2012 revealed that the Cube was built with dangerous design flaws and almost double its original estimated costs and a capacity of only half of what was planned.  A crater on Mars discovered in the late 1970s was named after Corby, in reference to a famous transcript of a conversation in June 1969 between the crew of the Apollo 11 mission and mission control, whereby world news was relayed to the crew, amongst it was the news that "in Corby, an Irishman named John Coyle won the World's Porridge Eating Championship by consuming 23 bowls of instant oatmeal in 10 minutes".  The reply from Apollo 11 "I'd like to enter Aldrin in the porridge eating contest next time; he's on the 19th bowl. Rodger." Corby's main football team is Corby Town F.C., who play in the National League North. The Steelmen play at Steel Park and have an average home attendance of 472 in 2014/15. The town's other semi-professional football club are [[Stewarts & Lloyds Corby F.C.]], who play in the [[United Counties League]]. S&L play their home matches at Occupation Road.  Corby is also home to the [[Corby East Midlands International Swimming Pool]] which was built in 2009. It is also home to the Stewarts and Lloyds Rugby Football Club which despite the long closure of the steel industry maintains its proud heritage of its industrial roots. The club plays in the RFU's Midland South East 3 division.  Corby also has an athletics club for under-11's to over 60's. In the Youth Development League, the upper age group gained promotion to Midland East 1 and gained promotion in the Heart of England Athletics League.  ==Transport==  ===Roads=== The town is located along the [[A43 road|A43]], [[A427 road|A427]], [[A6003 road|A6003]] and is {{convert|6|mi}} from the [[A14 road (England)|A14]] at [[Kettering]]. Corby lies within two hours' drive of four international airports: [[Birmingham International Airport (UK)|Birmingham]], [[Luton Airport|Luton]], [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] and [[East Midlands Airport|East Midlands]]. Being a new town, Corby's road network is different from that of older towns. There are several dual carriageways, most of the principal roads have wide reservations and high speed limits and pedestrian crossings over them are often underpasses. However, Corby is only connected by dual carriageway to one neighbouring town, [[Kettering]] (the [[A6003 road|A6003]]). All other roads into the town are single carriageways.  ===Buses=== [[File:Midland Mainline bus Corby Rail link livery in Kettering, Northamptonshire June 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Corby rail-link bus]] Corby is served by six bus routes under the [[Stagecoach in Northants|Corby Star]] brand name.<ref>[http://www.stagecoachbus.com/uploads/corbymapdownloadlo.pdf Stagecoach Northants: Corby Star network] Accessed 9 April 2010</ref> Service X4 connects the town with [[Peterborough]], [[Oundle]], [[Weldon, Northamptonshire|Weldon]], Danesholme, [[Kettering]], [[Isham]], [[Wellingborough]], [[Earls Barton]], [[Northampton]], [[Roade]], [[Grafton Regis]], [[Milton Keynes]] and [[London]].

Plans to build a new bus station in Corby are being considered by the council following the closure of the old bus station in August 2002.  ===Rail=== Corby used to be described as the largest town in Great Britain not to have a [[railway station]], or access within {{convert|5|mi}} of one — many other towns and localities claim this dubious honour (e.g. [[Gosport]], [[Dudley]], [[Newcastle under Lyme]]) but all of these places have locally available railway stations in adjacent suburban areas. Previously the nearest station was {{convert|7|mi}} south in [[Kettering]] since the closure of the original station under the [[Beeching Axe]] in April 1966.

[[File:LODGEPARK.jpg|thumb|Lodge Park Technology College on Shetland Way]] Since 1990 several of Corby's other secondary schools have fared less well with a series of poor examination results and critical inspection reports leading to mergers and closures, the most recent being the closure of Our Lady and Pope John School in 2005. Currently there are five secondary schools in Corby: Brooke Weston Academy, [[Lodge Park Academy]], [[Corby Business Academy]], [[Kingswood Secondary Academy]] and the newly opened Corby Technical School which opened to students in an old unused primary school in September 2012 with the new building completed and opened in November 2013. Corby Business Academy has a special unit for children with severe special educational needs. All four schools have [[sixth form]]s for post-16 students.  Corby has 17 primary schools, of which two are [[Church of England]] schools, three are [[Roman Catholic]] and one for children with severe [[Emotional and behavioral disorders|behavioural and emotional difficulties]].  ==Regeneration and redevelopment== Corby has an Urban Regeneration Company - North Northants Development Company, which now covers the whole of North Northamptonshire rather than just Corby (it was previously known as Catalyst Corby). The company is working closely with Corby Borough Council, Land Securities (town centre owners), the East Midlands Development Agency and the Homes and Communities Agency to regenerate the town centre as part of the masterplan for the whole town. The population of Corby town is expected to double in the next 30 years through housing on large estates such as Prior's Hall, Little Stanion, [[Oakley Vale]] and Great Oakley.  In October 2007 Corby's new shopping precinct, Willow Place, opened.<ref>[http://www.nndev.co.uk/newsdetail.php?nid=23 Mayor declares Willow Place officially open]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> In addition Parkland Gateway, the Borough's £50m investment situated adjacent to Willow Place and including a new Olympic-sized swimming pool and civic hub (due for completion in November 2010), is being built following its approval in January 2007. Work began on the project in October 2007 and the Corby East Midlands International Pool was officially opened by Olympian Mark Foster in July 2009. Although the Evolution Corby project is currently on hold, limited aesthetic augmentation work within the town centre continues.  Corby town center has recently gained a [[Wetherspoon]] Pub & Hotel called "The Saxon Crown".

The nearest official Metoffice weather station for which online records are available is [[Caldecott, Rutland|Caldecott]], about {{convert|3|mi}} north-north west of Corby town centre and in the Welland valley on the Northamptonshire–[[Leicestershire]] border. Observations have now ceased, and the nearest operational weather station is [[Wittering, Cambridgeshire|Wittering]], some {{convert|13|mi}} to the north east. The exact situation of the weather station at Caldecott is at 53&nbsp;m and in a valley location, meaning generally higher daytime temperatures than Corby itself (at 100–130&nbsp;m altitude) but also higher frost averages. Caldecott is in fact frostier than the frost hollow at [[Shawbury]] (70.2 frost days vs. 64 frost days at Shawbury), where [[England]]'s lowest December temperature was recorded. However, given temperatures between the 1961–90 period (displayed below) and 1971–2000 period have typically increased by 0.5 to 0.7 [[Celsius]], offset by the fall in temperature of a similar value between the 53&nbsp;m of the weather station and the 120&nbsp; or so of Corby town centre, the figures should provide accurate representation (in daytime values at least) of the town proper for the 1971–2000 period.
