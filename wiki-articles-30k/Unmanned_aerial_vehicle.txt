       An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, as an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), and also referred by several other names, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. The flight of UAVs may be controlled with various kinds of autonomy : either by a given degree of remote control from an operator, located on the ground or in another vehicle, or fully autonomously, by onboard computers. Historically, UAVs were simple remotely piloted aircrafts, but autonomous control is increasingly being employed : UAV stands nowadays at the crossroads of aviation, electromagnetics, radiocommunication, computer science, avionics, automation, cybernetics, and even core fields of artificial intelligence such as computer vision, decision-making, machine learning and robotics. UAVs are often preferred for missions that are too "dull, dirty or dangerous" for manned aircrafts.They have and are mostly found in military and special operation applications. Though, UAVs are increasingly finding uses in civil applications,  such as policing and surveillance, aerial filming and hobbyist FPV racing.   There are several names in use for unmanned aerial vehicles, which generally refer to the same concept. The term drone, more widely used by the public, was coined in reference to the male bee ressemblance to the historical preset paths of military unmanned aircrafts, which in addition  produced loud and regular motor sounds : the term has seen strong opposition from aviation professionals and government regulators. The term unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was adopted by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Federal Aviation Administration in 2005 according to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005–2030. Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap.  The International Civil Aviation Organization and the British Civil Aviation Authority have also adopted the term, while the European Union’s Single-European-Sky (SES) Air-Traffic-Management (ATM) Research (SESAR Joint Undertaking) roadmap for 2020 mentions it too.  Unmanned aircraft system emphasizes the importance of other elements beyond an aircraft itself. It includes elements such as the ground control stations, data links and other related support equipment. A similar term is an unmanned-aircraft vehicle system (UAVS) remotely piloted aerial vehicle (RPAV), remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS). Many similar terms are in use aswell. To distinguish UAVs from missiles, a UAV is defined as a "powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload".  Therefore, cruise missilesnareot considered UAVs because, like many other guided missiles, the vehicle itself is a weapon that is not reused, though it is also unmanned and in some cases remotely guided.  The '''definition of UAVs with respect to smaller [[remote controlled aircraft|remote controlled model aircraft]]''' is unclear{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}. According to various definitions UAVs may or may not include model aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Some jurisdictions base this definition on size or weight, however, the US Federal Aviation Administration defines any unmanned flying craft as a UAV regardless of size. In another approach, a radio-controlled aircraft becomes a drone with the addition of an autopilot AI, and ceases to be a drone when the AI is removed.<ref name="dronesetc">{{cite web|url=https://www.dronesetc.com/blogs/news/21481409-what-is-the-difference-between-a-drone-and-an-rc-plane-or-helicopter|publisher=Drones Etc|title=What is the difference between a drone and an RC plane or helicopter?|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>  ==History== {{Main|History of unmanned aerial vehicles}} [[File:Teledyne-Ryan-Firebee-hatzerim-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ryan Firebee]] was a series of [[target drone]]s/unpiloted aerial vehicles.]]  In 1849 Austria sent unmanned, bomb-filled balloons to attack [[Siege of Venice (1848)|Venice]].

[[Battery eliminator circuit|Battery elimination circuitry]] (BEC) is used to centralize power distribution and often harbors a [[Microcontroller|microcontroller unit]] (MCU). Costlier switching BECs diminish heating on the platform. =====Computing===== First large UAVs could carry high computational capabilities due to their extended available [[payload]] and did not urged engineers into miniaturization as they allowed complex-[[Instruction set|instruction-set]] chips ; whereas procesing power of civil-and-medium-domestic UAVs mostly leaned toward [[Reduced instruction set computing|Reduced Instruction Set]] computer design. Common [[Comparison of instruction set architectures|processor families]] there are AVR, PIC, [[ARM architecture|ARM]], with a current predominance of ARM’s 32-bit memory-adress-register processors. Thus small UAV [[Embedded system|embedded systems]]  evolved from the blending terms of microcontrollers, to [[System on a chip|system-on-a-chip]] (SOC), and as far as [[Single-board computer|single-board computers]] (SBC) at present.  UAV hardware is likely to specialize, with increasing numbers of operation per second and [[hardware acceleration]] as a background, between, on one hand, calculus speed in exchange for low processing power (time-critical applications), and high-computional-capacity, able to support full [[Operating system|operating systems]], trading with higher weight on the other hand.  =====Telecommunication module===== Most UAVs integer an old-fashioned [[RF front end|radio frequency front-end]], that connects the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] to the [[analog-to-digital converter]] and the following computing power.  =====Sensors===== Main sensors : * Proprioceptive : IMU (gyroscope, accelerometer), compass, altimeter, GPS module, payload measurement… * Exteroceptive : camera (CMOS, infrared), range sensors (radar, sonar, lidar)… * Exproprioceptive : internal/external thermometer, gimballed camera... Degrees of freedom (DOF) refer to both the amount and quality of sensors on-board : 6 DOF stands for 3-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers (a typical [[inertial measurement unit]] – IMU), 9 DOF refers to an IMU plus a compass, 10 DOF adds a barometer and 11 DOF usually combine a GPS receiver.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Arduino Playground - WhatIsDegreesOfFreedom6DOF9DOF10DOF11DOF|url = http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/WhatIsDegreesOfFreedom6DOF9DOF10DOF11DOF|website = playground.arduino.cc|access-date = 2016-02-04}}</ref>  =====Actuators===== Actuators found in UAVs depend heavily on the aircraft type : [[Electronic speed control|digital electronic speed controllers]] (which control the [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] of the motors) linked to motors/[[Engine|engines]] and [[Propeller|propellers]], [[Servomotor|servomotors]] (for planes and helicopters mostly), weapons, payload actuators, LEDs, speakers…  ====UAV Control systems hardware chart==== While referencing hardware from military projects proves tedious due to classified specificities, commercial and hobbyist systems are easier to overview. Small UAV control system hardware is often named, especially in hobbyists groups, as Flight Controller(FC), Flight Controller Board (FCB) or Autopilot.  Template see also ? ====Software==== The UAV computer softwares are layered in tiers with different time requirements. The compound of layers is sometimes called flight stack, or autopilot.  On-board classical operating systems alone are not ideal for flying UAVs : high respond times may be fatal to the aircraft. Thus they may be completed by externally-supported middlewares  : RaspberryPis, Beagleboards, etc. shielded with NavIO, PXFMini, etc. or designed from scratch for hard [[Real-time computing|real-time]] requirements, like Nuttx, preemp-RT Linux, Xenomai, Orocos-Robot Operating System, DDS-ROS 2.0 for instance.  {| class="wikitable" |+ Flight stack overview |- !Layer !Requirement !Operations !Example |- |Firmware |Time-critical |From machine code to processor execution, memory access… |ArduCopter-v1.px4 |- |Middleware |Time-critical |Flight control, navigation, radio management... |Cleanflight, ArduPilot |- |Operating system |Computer-intensive |Optic flow, obstacle avoidance, SLAM, decision-making... |ROS, Nuttx, Linux distributions, Microsoft IOT |}  A non-exhaustive list of civil-use open-source stacks : * KKMultiCopter * ArduCopter * DroneCode (forked from ArduCopter) * MultiWii * BaseFlight (forked from MultiWii) * CleanFlight (forked from BaseFlight) * BetaFlight (forked from CleanFlight) * Paparazzi * OpenPilot Copter Control * TauLabs (forked from OpenPilot) * CrazyFlie  ===Loop principles=== [[File:UAV Flight control.jpg|thumb|483x483px|Typical flight-control loops for a multirotor]] What may differentiate an UAV from a RC model aircraft is the ability to offer sensing, computing power and [[automation]]. The aircraft control falls under the relevancy of [[control theory]], with its associated notions. Indeed, an UAV can make use of different automatic controls, mainly designed with [[Control system|loops]] :  * [[Open-loop controller|Open-loops]] - The simplest design consists of open-loops, typically for motors of small UAVs, which are actuated with sheer input, assuming they will perform as expected (though, for many larger aircrafts, including UAVs, engine control relies on closed-loops). * [[Closed-loop transfer function|Closed-loops]] – [[Negative feedback|Negative-feedback]]-loops use sensors to measure the state of the [[dynamical system]], they are the most commonly used for flight control in UAVs. To monitor the execution of the loop, [[PID controller|PID control]] method stands for state-of-the art.

[[Telecommunication]] channels are mostly achieved with radiofrequency electromagnetic radiations. [[Telecommunications engineering|Telecommunication]] streams, were historically directed uplink, toward the UAV to monitor the flight. With progress in embedded electronics, downlink was made possible, emitting a signal from the UAV back to the operator, turning both UAV and operator communication systems into [[Transceiver|transceivers]].  In military systems, wich drove the duplex communications, and high-end domestic applications, downlink may also convey payload management status  and other advanced features. In the domestic-UAV field, the teletransmission pattern still usually remains as control commands issued from the operator’s transmitter (TX) toward the UAV receiver (RX), downstream consisting mainly in analog video content, from the UAV video emitter (VTX) to the operator’s video receiver (VRX). [[Telemetry]] is another kind of downstream link, transmitting status about the aircraft systems to the remote operator. UAVs use also satellite « uplink » to acess [[satellite navigation]].  The radio signal from the operator side can be issued from either : * a ground control – a human operating a [[Transmitter|radio transmitter]]/receiver,  a smartphone, a tablet, a computer, or the orginal meaning of a [[Ground control station|military ground control station (GCS)]].

Some UAVs use [[Open System Interconnection|Open System Interconnection layers]], to provide [[Wi-Fi Direct|Wi-Fi direct]] and access to [[ethernet]].  ===Autonomy===  As previously described UAV systems, robotics emerged shortly after the invention of transistors and modern electronics. At around the same time that analog-to-digital-modulated proportional radio control appeared, was designed the first digitally programmable robot.  Robotics core modules are the computing power, the actuators and the sensors. Autonomous UAVs, sometimes called flying robots, being  developed, arose the need to categorize their autonomy performance, in an UAV-focused manner. The ICAO as mentioned above classifies unmanned aircraft into two types : remotely piloted aircraft, or fully autonomous. Many further classifications have been issued, which, as explained later, can refer to : [[File:Autonomous control basics.jpg|thumb|left|482x482px|Autonomous control basics]] * commercial UAV applications, which offer today off-the-shelf autonomous modes that ensure a complete autonomy for determined functions.  * The degree of autonomy – the extent to which the aircraft is independent from the operator assistance - a full pilot authority would stand as a 0% degree of autonomy, while full autonomy would score 100%. * The level of autonomy – the sophistication of AI, the scope of tasks that the UAV can perform.  ==== Basic principles about autonomous control  ==== A simple way to achieve autonomous control consists in structuring multiple control-loop layers, such as [[Hierarchical control system|hierarchical control systems]]. The low-layer loops (i.e. for flight control) can tick as fast as 100 times per second, and the higher-level loops can be required cycles with lenghts around a second. The principle is to decompose the aircraft’s behavior into easily manageable « chunks », or states, with knowledgeable  transitions between them. HCSs types range from the simple [[Scripting language|scripts]], to [[Finite-state machine|finite state machines]], [[Behavior tree|behavior trees]] and [[Hierarchical task network|hierarchical task planners]].  Path planning, regulation and generation PREV UAV  Evolved UAV hierarchical task planners use methods like [[motion planning]], state [[Tree search algorithm|tree searches]] or, [[Genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2014/WCE2014_pp551-557.pdf|title = UAV Path Planning with Parallel Genetic Algorithms on CUDA Architecture|date = 2014|access-date = |website = World congress on engineering|publisher = |last = Cekmez, Ozsiginan, Aydin And Sahingoz|first = }}</ref>  ==== Autonomous modes ==== UAV manufacturers often offer built-in autonomous modes. * Self-level : the aircraft stabilizes its altitude by itself using on-board sensors.  * Hover : altitude stabilization is reinforced by attitude stabilization on the pitch, roll and yaw axis. The latter can be achieved by sensing GNSS coordinates, called alone position hold. * Loiter, which can be thought of as a relaxed hover mode. * A feature called by some designers care-free : the aircraft radio control will free the operator from managing the impact of the aircraft heading on the roll and yaw controls. * Autonomous take-off and landing * Failsafe : the UAV will land automatically as soon as the control signal is lost. * Return-to-home * Follow-me * GPS waypoint navigation * Pre-programmed tricks like rolls, loops… * Flight control modes (beginner, acro…) adjusting flight enveloppe to meet operator experience.

Basic levels of autonomy are handily resolved using proprioceptive sensors, that give information about the aircraft state. Advanced autonomy calls for situational awareness, gaining knowledge about the environment surrounding the aircraft : sensor fusion aggregates different information provided by multiple sensors. Exteroceptive sensors deal with fully-external information like range measurements, while exproprioceptive ones correlate internal and external states.

Most of the range sensors analyze elecromagnetic radiations, reflected on the environment and coming to the sensor. The cameras (for visual flow) stands as simple receivers of radiations in the visible spectrum and near it, whereas Lidars, radars, and sonars (with sound mechanical waves) emit and receive waves, and measure the time taken by the ondulations to perform the round-trip. The primary source of wave emission is external for cameras, and internal for the rest - the environment in all cases being the secondary source : one major pros with cameras in UAVs is that they do not require emitting power, they are much less power-consuming on already power-restrained platforms.  Radars and sonars are mostly used for large UAVs in the militaries. Audio power detection from other UAVs’ engines, magnetic or heat detection are eventually another kind of range sensing.  Reactive autonomy has in some forms already reached consumer market : it is predicted to be widely deployed within less than a decade.[[File:Autonomous-control-level-trend.png|thumb|354x354px|Cutting-edge (2013) autonomous levels for existing systems]] ===== Cognitive autonomy ===== {{See also|Second-order cybernetics|Cognitive robotics|Ubiquitous computing}}A roadmap for a more advanced cognitive autonomy would include :  ===== [[Simultaneous localization and mapping]] ===== SLAM combines odometry and external data to represent the world and the position of the UAV in it.

They provide greater flexibility than multi-agent cooperation recurring to a maximal decentralization. Swarming may open the path to the sensor fusion next-level : data fusion. While some bio-inspired flight swarms already use steering behaviors and flocking, more advanced UAVs-swarm patterns, path planning or attacks are being researched.  ====== Future military potential of swarms (USA) ====== In the military sector, [[Predator Plane|Predators]] and [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|Reapers]] are tailor-made for counterterrorism operations and in war zones in which the enemy lacks sufficient firepower to shoot them down, but are not designed to withstand antiaircraft defenses or air-to-air combat; in September 2013, the chief of the Air Combat Command stated that current UAVs were "useless in a contested environment" unless manned aircraft were put there to protect them.[167] A 2012 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report indicated that in the future, UAVs may be able to perform a variety of tasks beyond their present roles in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strikes; the CRS report listed air-to-air combat ("a more difficult future task") as possible future undertakings.[168] The U.S. Department of Defense's Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap FY2013-2038 foresees UAVs having a more important place in combat, recognizing that the near future will involve making sure the technology works at all, before exploiting their potential in the following decade.[169] Beyond solving technical issues, issues to be resolved include human-UAV interaction, managing expected increases in amounts of information generated by UAV swarms, transitioning from direct human control to UAVs' automatic adaptation to changing conditions, and developing UAV-specific munitions.[169] Indeed [[DARPA]]’s project of systems of systems,<ref>{{Cite web|title = DARPA's Plan to Overwhelm Enemies With Swarming Drones - Drone 360|url = http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/drone360/2015/04/06/darpas-swarming-drones/#.VrHhSPnhDcc|website = Drone 360|access-date = 2016-02-03|language = en-US}}</ref> or [[General Atomics]] may augur future warfare scenarios, the latter disclosing [[General Atomics Avenger|Avenger]] swarms equipped with [[High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System|HELLADS]].<ref>{{Citation|title = US Air force STEALTH UAV armed with LASER GUN named General Atomics Avenger|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPvBDlQOtqY|date = 2014-01-17|accessdate = 2016-02-03|last = NewWorldofWeapons}}</ref>  ===== [[Cognitive radio|Radio cognition]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/19295/Young_AR_D_2013.pdf?sequence=1|title = Unified Multi-domain Decision Making: Cognitive Radio and Autonomous Vehicle Convergence|date = December 2012|access-date = |website = Faculty of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|publisher = |last = Young|first = }}</ref> =====  ===== Decision making ===== {{See also|BELBIC}}UAVs able to take high-level decisions on their own are researched with [[fuzzy logic]], [[preference-based planning]], [[Multiple-criteria decision analysis|multi-criteria decision analysis]] for example.  ===== Learning capabilities ===== The application to UAVs of the ever-deeper [[Artificial neural network|distributed neural networks]] are promising to many.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.airccse.org/journal/ijaia/papers/5414ijaia01.pdf|title = A review on distributed control of cooperating mini UAVs|date = 2014|access-date = |website = International Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Applications (IJAIA)|publisher = |last = Ali, Gageik, Montenegro|first = }}</ref> ==Uses== {{globalize/US|section|date=January 2016}} [[File:Package copter microdrones dhl.jpg|thumb|In 2013, the [[DHL Express|DHL]] parcel service tested a "microdrones md4-1000" for delivery of medicine.]] [[File:Interspect UAV B 3.1.png|thumb|[[Interspect UAS B 3.1]] octocopter for commercial aerial cartographic purposes and 3D mapping]] [[File:FOX-C8-HD AltiGator OnyxStar.jpg|thumb|Civil Drone FOX-C8-HD [[AltiGator]]]] [[File:IAI Heron 1 in flight 1.JPEG|thumb|[[IAI Heron]], an unmanned aerial vehicle developed by the Malat (UAV) division of [[Israel Aerospace Industries]]]] [[File:s4ehecatl1.jpg|thumb|A [[Hydra Technologies Ehécatl]] taking-off for a surveillance mission]]  Beyond the military applications of UAVs with which "drones" became most associated, numerous civil aviation uses have been developed, including aerial surveying of crops,<ref name=WashPost20130816/> acrobatic aerial footage in  filmmaking,<ref name=WashPost20130816/> search and rescue operations,<ref name=WashPost20130816/> inspecting power lines and pipelines,<ref name=WashPost20130819/> counting wildlife,<ref name=WashPost20130819/> delivering medical supplies to remote or otherwise inaccessible regions,<ref name=TED201311/> with some manufacturers [[rebranding]] the technology as "unmanned aerial systems" (UASs) in preference over the military-connotative term "drones".<ref name=WashPost20130816>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/16/why-drone-makers-have-declared-war-on-the-word-drone/ |title=Why drone makers have declared war on the word ‘drone’ |last=Fung |first=Brian |date=16 August 2013 |website=The Washington Post |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IwTScW2U |archivedate=17 August 2013 }}</ref>  Further uses include reconnaissance operations,<ref name=MotionCoord/><ref>Saska, M.;

The U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] began using the [[Insitu Aerosonde|Aerosonde]] unmanned aircraft system in 2006 as a [[hurricane]] hunter. The 35-pound system can fly into a hurricane and communicate near-real-time data directly to the [[National Hurricane Center]]. Beyond the standard barometric pressure and temperature data typically culled from manned hurricane hunters, the Aerosonde system provides measurements from closer to the water’s surface than previously captured. NASA later began using the [[Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk]] for extended hurricane measurements.  ===Military Uses===  ====Reconnaissance==== {{see also|Battlefield UAV|reconnaissance aircraft}} The [[Tupolev Tu-141|Tu-141]] "Swift" reusable Soviet operational and tactical [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] drone is intended for reconnaissance to a depth of several hundred kilometers from the front line at supersonic speeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airwar.ru/enc/bpla/tu141.html |title=Туполев Ту-141 Стриж |publisher=Airwar.ru |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> The [[Tupolev Tu-123|Tu-123]] "Hawk" is a supersonic long-range reconnaissance drone (UAV) intended for conducting photographic and signals intelligence to a distance of 3200&nbsp;km; it was produced since 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airwar.ru/enc/spy/tu123.html |title=Туполев Ту-123 Ястреб |publisher=Airwar.ru |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> The La-17P (UAV) is a reconnaissance UAV produced since 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airwar.ru/enc/bpla/la17r.html |title=Лавочкин Ла-17Р |publisher=Airwar.ru |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Since 1945, the Soviet Union also produced "doodlebug".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://topwar.ru/19339-samolety-snaryady-sssr.html |title=Самолеты-снаряды СССР » Военное обозрение |publisher=Topwar.ru |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> There are 43 known Soviet UAV models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airwar.ru/bpla.html |title=Беспилотные аппараты |publisher=Airwar.ru |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref>  In 2013, the U.S. Navy launched a UAV from a submerged submarine, the first step to "providing mission intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities to the U.S. Navy’s submarine force."<ref>{{cite web|last=Cenciotti |first=David |url=http://theaviationist.com/2013/12/06/uas-from-submarine/ |title=U.S. Navy successfully launched a surveillance drone from a submerged submarine |publisher=The Aviationist |date=6 December 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref>  ====Armed attacks==== {{See also|Targeted killing|Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|Drone attacks in Pakistan}} [[File:Predator and Hellfire.jpg|thumb|[[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] launching a Hellfire missile]]  When the United States entered the global [[war on terror]], U.S. military officials found difficulty in fighting irregular warfare.

The maximum flight duration of unmanned aerial vehicles varies widely.  Because of the small size, weight, low vibration and high power to weight ratio, Wankel rotary engines are used in many large UAV aircrafts.[191][192] Additionally: the engine rotors cannot seize; the engine is not susceptible to shock-cooling during descent and it does not require an enriched fuel mixture for cooling at high power. The attributes of the Wankel engine transpire into less fuel usage in UAVs giving greater range or a higher payload.[193]  [[File:Flight time against mass of small (less than 1 kg) drones.jpg|thumb|left|Flight time against mass of small (less than 1 kg) drones.

Micro air vehicles endurance is best achieved with flapping-wing UAVs, followed by planes, and multirotors standing as last, due to lower [[Reynolds number|Reyold numbers]].  Solar-electric UAVs, a concept originally championed by the AstroFlight Sunrise in 1974, have achieved endurance of several weeks.[194][195][196][197][198]  Solar-powered atmospheric satellites ("atmosats") designed for operating at altitudes exceeding 20 km (12 miles, or 60,000 feet) for as long as five years would perform duties more economically and with more versatility than low earth orbit satellites.[170] Likely applications include weather monitoring, disaster recovery, earth imaging, and communications.[170] [Google 5G]  Electric UAVs powered by microwave power transmission - in the same way a RFID reader can activate a tag to make it answer back [199], or laser power beaming[200] are other proposed solutions to the endurance challenge.  Another of the uses for a high endurance UAV would be to "stare" at the battlefield for a long period of time (ARGUS-IS, Gorgon Stare, Integrated Sensor Is Structure) to produce a record of events that could then be played backwards to track where improvised explosive devices (IEDs) came from.  {| class="wikitable" style="font-size:95%;" |+ Notable high endurance flights |- !
