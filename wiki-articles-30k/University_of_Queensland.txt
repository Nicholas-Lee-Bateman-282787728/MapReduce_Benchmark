     The University of Queensland, commonly referred to as UQ, is an Australian public research university primarily located in Queensland's capital city, Brisbane. Founded in 1909, UQ is one of Australia's oldest, most selective and comprehensive universities. The main campus is located in St Lucia, southwest of the Brisbane City Central Business District, with other major UQ campuses in Gatton, Herston and Ochsner Medical Center's clinical school at New Orleans, United States of America. The University of Queensland is a member of the Australia's research-intensive Group of Eight, the global network of research universities, Universitas 21 and a founding charter member of EdX, an online higher education consortium led by Harvard and MIT. UQ is a sandstone university, which is well regardedDepartment of Education Training and Youth Affairs (1998), The Characteristics and Performance of Higher Education Institutions, Canberra:  Higher Education Division, Department of Education, Employment and Youth AffairsDepartment of Education Training and Youth Affairs (1999), Completions, Undergraduate academic outcomes for the 1992 commencing students, Melbourne:  DETYA. and is consistently ranked within the top 1 percent of all international university rankings, along with other prestigious research universities.http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2011http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2012.html[ ] In 2015 for example, UQ was ranked next to Brown University, a member of the Ivy League, in Shanghai's Academic Ranking of World Universities and positioned ahead of King's College London and McGill University in the U.S. News & World Report global ranking. UQ Business School's flagship MBA program is also ranked 16th by The Economist Intelligence Unit, bracketed by MIT (15th) and Yale (19th).http://www.economist.com/whichmba/full-time-mba-ranking?fsrc=scn/fb/te/bl/ed/MBARankings The University of Queensland has produced numerous alumni with significant contributions to science, arts, medicine, education, business, politics and law in Australia and throughout the world. Several notable examples include the Nobel Laureate  winning scientist, Dr Peter Doherty, Oscar-winning artist Geoffrey Rush, former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Gerard Brennan, Chancellor of University of California, San Francisco, Dr Sam Hawgood, Principal and President of King's College London, Dr Edward Byrne, CEO of Dow Chemical the second-largest chemical manufacturer in the world by revenue, Andrew N. Liveris, first female Governor-General of Australia, Dame Quentin Bryce, former Singapore's Minister for Defence, Minister for Manpower, present Chairman of Keppel Corporation and Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), Dr Lee Boon Yang, consecutive Olympics gold medal winner, David Theile  and global top two most cited academic (by h-factor) and world-renowned clinician, Dr Graham Colditz.  Proposals for a university in Queensland began in the 1870s.  A Royal Commission in 1874, chaired by Sir Charles Lilley, recommended the immediate establishment of a university.  Those against a university argued that technical rather than academic education was more important in an economy dominated by primary industry.  Those in favour of the university, in the face of this opposition, distanced themselves from Oxford and Cambridge and proposed instead a model derived from the mid-western states of the USA.  A second Royal Commission in 1891 recommended the inclusion of five faculties in a new university; Arts, Law, Medicine, Science and Applied Science. Education generally was given a low priority in Queensland's budgets, and in a colony with a literacy rate of 57% in 1861, primary education was the first concern well ahead of secondary and technical education. The government, despite the findings of the Royal Commissions, was unwilling to commit funds to the establishment of a university. In 1893 the Queensland University Extension Movement was begun by a group of private individuals who organised public lecture courses in adult education, hoping to excite wider community support for a university in Queensland.  In 1894, 245 students were enrolled in the extension classes and the lectures were described as practical and useful.  In 1906 the University Extension Movement staged the University Congress, a forum for interested delegates to promote the idea of a university.  Opinion was mobilised, a fund was started and a draft Bill for a Queensland University was prepared.  Stress was laid on the practical aspects of university education and its importance for the commerce of Queensland.  The proceedings of the Congress were forwarded to Queensland Premier William Kidston.  In October 1906,  sixty acres in Victoria Park were gazetted for university purposes. The University of Queensland was established by an Act of State Parliament on December 10, 1909 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Queensland's separation from the colony of New South Wales.  The Act allowed for the university to be governed by a senate of 20 men and Sir William MacGregor, the incoming Governor, was appointed the first chancellor with Reginald Heber Roe as the vice chancellor. Government House (now Old Government House) in George Street was set aside for the University following the departure of the Governor to the Bardon residence Fernberg, sparking the first debates about the best location for the university. In 1910 the first teaching faculties were created.  These included Engineering, Classics, Mathematics and Chemistry.  In December of the same year,  the Senate appointed the first four professors; Bertram Dillon Steele in chemistry, John Lundie Michie in classics, Henry James Priestley in mathematics and Alexander James Gibson in engineering.  In 1911 the first students enrolled. The University's first classes in the Government house were held in 1911 with 83 commencing students and Sir William MacGregor is the first chancellor (with Reginald Heber Roe as vice-chancellor). The development of the University was delayed by World War I, but after the first world war the university enrollments for education and research took flight as demand for higher education increased in Australia. Thus, in the early 1920s the growing University had to look for a more spacious campus as its original site at George Street, Brisbane has limited room for expansion.  In 1927, Dr James O'Neil Mayne and his sister Mary Emelia Mayne, provided a grant of approximately Â£50,000 to the Brisbane City Council to acquire  of land at St Lucia and provided it to the University of Queensland as its permanent home. In the same year, the pitch drop experiment was started by Professor Thomas Parnell. The experiment has been described as the world's oldest and continues to this day. Lack of finance delayed development of the St Lucia campus. Hence, the construction of the University's first building in St Lucia only began in 1938. It was later named the Forgan Smith Building, after the Premier of the day and it was completed in 1939. During World War II, the Forgan Smith Building was used as a military base and it served first as advanced headquarters for the Allied Land Forces in the South West Pacific. In 1990, Australia reorganized its higher education system by abolishing the binary system of universities and colleges of advanced education. Under this transition, the University merged with Queensland Agricultural College, to establish the new UQ Gatton campus. In 1999, UQ Ipswich began operation as one of the completely Web-enabled campuses in Australia.University of Queensland History In May 2013, UQ joined edX, an international consortium of massive open online courses (MOOCs). Due to start in May 2014, the initial four UQxhttp://uqx.uq.edu.au/uqx-courses courses will cover hypersonics, tropical coastal ecosystems, biomedical imaging and the science of everyday thinking.   The Ipswich campus opened in 1999 and was made up of nearly 20 buildings and more than 5001 students on nearly .Ipswich History Courses offered included: arts, business, medicine and social sciences as well as Interaction design. It is located near central Ipswich, Queensland, just south of the CBD. Nearby landmarks include Limestone Park, Workshops Rail Museum and RAAF Base Amberley. The site dates back to 1878 with the opening of the Ipswich branch of the Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum. Operations continued until 1910 when it became the Ipswich Hospital for the Insane. In 1938 it was renamed the Ipswich Mental Hospital and in 1964 it was renamed again as the Ipswich Special Hospital. It was finally named the Challinor Centre in 1968 in honour of Dr. Henry Challinor, the ship's surgeon on the Fortitude. From 1968 to 1997 the Challinor Centre served as an institution for people with intellectual disabilities. In late 1997 the Challinor Centre began its first stage of transformation as the new UQ Ipswich campus. In 2014, UQ sold the Ipswich Campus to the University of Southern Queensland, believing that this regional teaching campus would be better utilised by USQ.   The University of Queensland is organised into a number of divisions for academic, administrative and logistical purposes.University of Queensland Organisational Chart The Senate is the governing body of the University of Queensland and consists of 22 members from the university and community. The Senate is led by the Chancellor and Deputy Chancellor, elected by the Senate. The University of Queensland Act 1998 grants Senate wide powers to appoint staff, manage and control University affairs and property, and manage and control finances to promote the University's interests.University of Queensland SenatePrincipal Officers of the University of Queensland The Vice-Chancellor is the University's chief executive officer and is appointed by and responsible to the Senate for the overall direction of strategic planning, finance and affairs of the university and also acts as the President of the University. The Vice-Chancellor is supported by an Executive to whom the University's organisational units report and provides advice on policy and administrative matters relating to their area of responsibility.  The Academic Board is the University's senior academic advisory body. It formulates policy on academic matters including new programs, teaching, learning and assessment, research, promotions, student academic matters, prizes and scholarships. An Academic Board member is elected annually as its President. The President is assisted by a half-time Deputy President.University of Queensland Academic Board Its members include the Vice-Chancellor's Executive, Executive Deans of Faculties, Institute Directors, Heads of Schools, Dean of the Graduate School, Directors of Central Service Units, the University Academic Registrar, the President of the UQ Student Union, and 5 Student Representatives.  The university has six faculties to support both research and teaching activities.    UQ has a semester-based modular system for conducting academic courses. The Australian higher education model features a combination of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) and the American system (course credits). The success of The University of Queensland's research, research commercialization and education have been reflected in its notable standing in all major global universities rankings.  Queensland has a strong research focus in science, medicine and technology. The university's research advancement includes pioneering the development of the cervical cancer vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, by UQ Professor Ian Frazer and then subsequent improvements by researchers from the United States.   In 2009, the Australian Cancer Research Foundation reported that UQ have taken the lead in numerous areas of cancer research.  In 2010, Thomson Reuters named eight UQ professors to its list of Highly Cited Researchers.http://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2010/04/uq-researchers-gain-international-recognition In the Commonwealth Government's Excellence in Research for Australia 2012 National Report,http://www.arc.gov.au/pdf/era12/report_2012/ARC_ERA12_Introduction.pdf UQ's research is rated above world standard in more broad fields than at any other Australian university (in 22 broad fields); and more UQ researchers are working in research fields that ERA has assessed as above world standard than at any other Australian university. UQ research in biomedical and clinical health sciences, technology, engineering, biological sciences, chemical sciences, environmental sciences, and physical sciences were ranked above world standard (rating 5). In 2015, UQ is ranked by Nature Index as the research institution with the highest volume of research output in both interdisciplinary journals Nature and  Science within the southern hemisphere, with approximately two fold more output than the global average.[ ] Besides disciplinary focused research within the academic faculties, the University of Queensland maintains a number of interdisciplinary research institutes and centres at the national, state and university levels.University of Queensland Listing of Research Institutes and Centres With the support from the Queensland Government, the Australian Government and major donor The Atlantic Philanthropies, the University of Queensland dedicates basic, translational and applied research via these eight research-focused institutes: UniQuest is the main commercialisation company of the The University of Queensland and specialises in global technology transfer and facilitates access for all business. UniQuest has created over 70 companies from its intellectual property portfolio, and since 2000 UniQuest and its start-ups have raised more than $490 million to take university technologies to market. UQ technologies licensed by UniQuest include UQ's cervical cancer vaccine technology, image correction technology in magnetic resonance imaging machines, and the Triple P Positive Parenting Program. The University of Queensland consistently ranks in the top 1 percent of all major world university rankings. In more specific subject rankings, UQ Business School's flagship MBA program is also ranked first in Australia and the Asia Pacific by The Australian Financial Review and The Economist Intelligence Unit.
