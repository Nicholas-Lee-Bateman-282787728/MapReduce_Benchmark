     A quilt is a multi-layered textile, traditionally composed of three layers of fiber: a woven cloth top, a layer of batting or wadding, and a woven back, combined using the technique of quilting, the process of sewing the three layers together. Occasionally, the three layers of the quilt are tied together using evenly spaced knots rather than sewn. This unique process of binding three layers of fiber together distinguishes quilts from other types of blankets, although in modern British English, an unquilted duvet or comforter may also be called a "quilt." Historically, quilts were frequently used as bedcovers; this use persists today, but in the twenty-first century, quilts are also frequently displayed as non-utilitarian works of art. Where a single piece of fabric is used for the top of a quilt (a wholecloth quilt), the key decorative element is likely to be the pattern of stitching, but where the top is pieced from a patchwork of smaller fabric pieces, the pattern and color of the pieces will be important to the design. Historically, quilts were frequently used as bedcovers or served other functional purposes. However, the work involved in creating them and their decorative possibilities has led to their cultural importance in many places and times, and they are increasingly also treated as a visual art form. There are many traditions regarding the uses of quilts. Quilts may be made or given to mark important life events such as marriage, the birth of a child, a family member leaving home, or graduations.  Modern quilts are not always intended for use as bedding, and may be used as wall hangings, table runners, or tablecloths. Quilting techniques are often incorporated into garment design as well. Quilt shows and competitions are held locally, regionally, and nationally. There are international competitions as well, particularly in the United States, Japan, and Europe.  The following list summarizes most of the reasons a person might decide to make a quilt: Quilting traditions are particularly prominent in the United States, where the necessity of creating warm bedding met the paucity of local fabrics in the early days of the colonies. Imported fabric was very expensive, and local homespun fabric was labor-intensive to create and tended to wear out sooner than commercial fabric. It was essential for most families to use and preserve textiles efficiently. Saving or salvaging small scraps of fabric was a part of life for all households. Small pieces of fabric were joined together to make larger pieces, in units called “blocks.” Creativity could be expressed in the block designs, or simple “utility quilts,” with minimal decorative value, could be produced. Crib quilts for infants were needed in the cold of winter, but even early examples of beautiful baby quilts indicate the efforts that women made to welcome a new baby.  Quilting was often a communal activity, involving all the women and girls in a family or in a larger community. The tops were prepared in advance, and a quilting bee was arranged, during which the actual quilting was completed by multiple people. Quilting frames were often used to stretch the quilt layers and maintain even tension to produce high-quality quilting stitches and to allow many individual quilters to work on a single quilt at one time. Quilting bees were important social events in many communities, and were typically held between periods of high demand for farm labor. Quilts were frequently made to commemorate major life events, such as marriages. There are many traditions regarding the number of quilts a young woman (and her family) was expected to have made prior to her wedding, for the establishment of her new home. Given the demands on a new wife, and the learning curve in her new role, it was prudent to provide her some reserve time with quilts already completed. Specific wedding quilts continue to be made today. Wedding ring quilts, which have a patchwork design of interlocking rings, have been made since the 1930s. White wholecloth quilts with high-quality, elaborate quilting, and often trapunto decorations as well, are also traditional for weddings. Interestingly, it was considered bad luck to incorporate heart motifs in a wedding quilt (the couples’ hearts might be broken if such a design were included), so tulip motifs were often used to symbolize love in wedding quilts. Quilts were often made for other events as well, such as graduations, or when individuals left their homes for other communities. One example of this is the quilts made as farewell gifts for pastors; some of these gifts were subscription quilts. For a subscription quilt, community members would pay to have their names embroidered on the quilt top, and the proceeds would be given to the departing minister. Sometimes the quilts were auctioned off to raise additional money, and the quilt might be donated back to the minister by the winner. A logical extension of this tradition led quilts being made to raise money for other community projects, such as recovery from a flood or natural disaster, and later, for fundraising for war. Subscription quilts were made for all of America’s wars. In a new tradition, quilt makers across the United States have been making quilts for wounded veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts.  Appliqué is a sewing technique where an upper layer of fabric is sewn onto a ground fabric. The upper, applied fabric shape can be of any shape or contour. There are several different appliqué techniques and styles. In needle-turn appliqué, the raw edges of the appliquéd fabric are tucked beneath the design to minimize raveling or damage, and small hand stitches are made to secure down the design. The stitches are made with a hem stitch, so that the thread securing the fabric is minimally visible from the front of the work. There are other methods to secure the raw edge of the appliquéd fabric, and some people use basting stitches, fabric-safe glue, freezer paper, paper forms, or starching techniques to prepare the fabric that will be applied, prior to sewing it on. Supporting paper or other materials are typically removed after the sewing is complete. The ground fabric is often cut away from behind, after the sewing is complete, in order to minimize the bulk of the fabric in that region. A special form of appliqué is Broderie perse, which involves the appliqué of specific motifs that have been selected from a printed fabric.  For example, a series of flower designs might be cut out of one fabric with a vine design, rearranged, and sewn down on a new fabric to create the image of a rose bush.  Reverse appliqué is a sewing technique where a ground fabric is cut, another piece of fabric is placed under the ground fabric, the raw edges of the ground fabric are tucked under, and the newly folded edge is sewn down to the lower fabric. Stitches are made as inconspicuous as possible. Reverse appliqué techniques are often used in combination with traditional appliqué techniques, to give a variety of visual effects. Trapunto is a sewing technique where two layers of fabric surrounding a layer of batting are quilted together, and then additional material is added to a portion of the design to increase the profile of relief as compared to the rest of the work. The effect of the elevation of one portion is often heightened by closely quilting the surrounding region, to compress the batting layer in that part of the quilt, thus receding the background even further. Cording techniques may also be used, where a channel is created by quilting, and a cord or yarn is pulled through the batting layer, causing a sharp change in the texture of the quilt. For example, several pockets may be quilted in the pattern of a flower, and then extra batting pushed through a slit in the backing fabric (which will later be sewn shut). The stem of the rose might be corded, creating a dimensional effect. The background could be quilted densely in a stipple pattern, causing the space around the rose bush to become less prominent. These techniques are typically executed with wholecloth quilts, and with batting and thread that matches the top fabric. Some artists have used contrasting colored thread, to create an outline effect. Colored batting behind the surface layer can create a shadowed effect. Brightly colored yarn cording behind white cloth can give a pastel effect on the surface. Additional decorative elements may be added to the surface of a quilt to create a three-dimensional or whimsical effect. The most common objects sewn on are beads or buttons. Decorative trim, piping, sequins, found objects, or other items can also be secured to the surface. The topic of embellishment is explored further on another page.  English paper piecing is a hand-sewing technique used to maximize accuracy when piecing complex angles together. A paper shape is cut with the exact dimensions of the desired piece. Fabric is then basted to the paper shape. Adjacent units are then placed face to face, and the seam is whipstitched together. When a given piece is completely surrounded by all the adjacent shapes, the basting thread is cut, and the basting and the paper shape are removed.  ===Foundation piecing=== [[Foundation piecing]] is a sewing technique that allows maximum stability of the work as the piecing is created, minimizing the distorting effect of working with slender pieces or bias-cut pieces. In the most basic form of foundation piecing, a piece of paper is cut to the size of the desired block. For utility quilts, a sheet of newspaper was used. In modern foundation piecing, there are many commercially available foundation papers. A strip of fabric or a fabric scrap is sewn by machine to the foundation. The fabric is flipped back and pressed. The next piece of fabric is sewn through the initial piece and its foundation paper. Subsequent pieces are added sequentially. The block may be trimmed flush with the border of the foundation. After the blocks are sewn together, the paper is removed, unless the foundation is an acid-free material that will not damage the quilt over time.  ==Quilting styles==  ===United States===  ====Amish==== [[Amish]] quilts are reflections of the Amish way of life. As a part of their religious commitment, Amish people have chosen to reject "worldly" elements in their dress and lifestyle, and their quilts historically reflected this, although today Amish make and use quilts in a variety of styles.<ref name=":1" /> Traditionally, the Amish use only solid colors in their clothing and the quilts they intend for their own use, in community-sanctioned colors and styles. In [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], early Amish quilts were typically made of solid-colored, lightweight wool fabric, off the same bolts of fabric used for family clothing items, while in many Midwestern communities, cotton predominated. Although classic Amish quilts appear austere from a distance, the craftsmanship is often of the highest quality and features lush quilting patterns that contrast with the plain background. Antique Amish quilts are among the most highly prized by collectors and quilting enthusiasts. The oldest quilts created by Amish people reflect their strong, internal cultural influences, which were to some degree separate from the non-Amish culture around them. The color combinations used in a quilt can help experts determine the community in which the quilt was produced. Many consider these quilts the art of the Amish. Since the 1970s, Amish quiltmakers have made quilts for the consumer market, with quilt cottage industries and retail shops popping up in Amish settlements across North America.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|last1=Smucker|first1=Janneken|title=Amish Quilts: Crafting an American Icon|date=2013|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9781421410531}}</ref>  ====Baltimore album==== {{main|Baltimore album quilts}} [[Baltimore album quilts]] originated in the region around [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in the 1840s, where a unique and highly developed style of appliqué quilting briefly flourished. Baltimore album quilts are variations on album quilts, which are collections of appliquéd blocks, each with a different design. These designs often feature floral patterns, but many other motifs are used as well. Baskets of flowers, wreaths, buildings, books, and birds are common motifs.  Designs are often highly detailed, and display the quiltmaker's skill. New dyeing techniques became available in this period, allowing the creation of new, bold colors, which the quilters used enthusiastically. New techniques for printing on the fabrics also allowed portions of fabric to be shaded, which heightens the three-dimensional effect of the designs. The background fabric is typically white or off-white, allowing maximal contrast to the delicate designs. [[India ink]] allowed handwritten accents and also allowed the blocks to be signed. Some of these quilts were created by professional quilters, and patrons could commission quilts made of new blocks, or select blocks that were already available for sale. There has been a resurgence of quilting in the Baltimore style, with many of the modern quilts experimenting with bending some of the old rules.  ====Crazy quilts==== {{main|Crazy quilting}} [[Crazy quilt]]s are so named because their pieces are not regular, and they are scattered across the top of the quilt like "crazed" (cracked or crackled) pottery [[Glazing (ceramics)|glazing]]. They were originally very refined, luxury items. Geometric pieces of rich fabrics were sewn together, and highly decorative embroidery was added. Such quilts were often effectively samplers of embroidery stitches and techniques, displaying the development of needle skills of those in the well-to-do late 19th-century home. They were show pieces, not used for warmth, but for display. The luxury fabrics used precluded frequent washing. They often took years to complete. Fabrics used included silks, wools, velvet, linen, and cotton. The mixture of fabric textures, such as a smooth silk next to a textured brocade or velvet, was embraced. Designs were applied to the surface, and other elements such as ribbons, lace, and decorative cording were used exuberantly. Names and dates were often part of the design, added to commemorate important events or associations of the maker. Politics were included in some, with printed campaign handkerchiefs and other preprinted textiles (such as advertising silks) included to declare the maker's sentiments.  ====African-American==== [[File:PowersBibleQuilt_1898.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Harriet Powers]]' 1898 bible quilt.]]  By the time that early [[African American|African-American]] quilting became a tradition in and of itself, it was already a combination of textile traditions from four civilizations of [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]]: the [[Mande languages|Mande-speaking peoples]], the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Fon people|Fon]] peoples, the [[Ekoi people|Ejagham peoples]], and the [[Kongo people]]s. As textiles were traded heavily throughout the Caribbean, Central America, and the Southern United States, the traditions of each distinct region became intermixed. Originally, most of the textiles were made by men. Yet when slaves were brought to the United States, their work was divided according to Western patriarchal standards and women took over the tradition. However, this strong tradition of weaving left a visible mark on African-American quilting. The use of strips, reminiscent of the strips of reed and fabric used in men's traditional weaving, are used in fabric quilting. A break in a pattern symbolized a rebirth in the ancestral power of the creator or wearer. It also helped keep evil spirits away; evil is believed to travel in straight lines and a break in a pattern or line confuses the spirits and slows them down. This tradition is highly recognizable in African-American improvisations on European-American patterns. The traditions of improvisation and multiple patterning also protect the quilter from anyone copying their quilts. These traditions allow for a strong sense of ownership and creativity.<ref>Maude Southwell Wahlman.

This attention came from two opposing points of view, one validating the practices of rural Southern African-American quilters and another asserting that there was no one style but rather the same individualization found among white quilters.<ref>{{cite web|last1=International Quilt Study Center & Museum|title=Race|url=http://worldquilts.quiltstudy.org/americanstory/identity/race|website=World Quilts: The American Story|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref> John Vlach, in a 1976 exhibition, and Maude Wahlman, co-organizing a 1979 exhibition, both cited the use of strips, high-contrast colors, large design elements, and multiple patterns as characteristic and compared them to rhythms in black music.<ref>Janet Catherine Berlo and Patricia Cox Crews, ''Wild by Design: Two Hundred Years of Innovation and Artistry in American Quilts, Lincoln, NB, International Quilt Study Center at the University of Nebraska in association with University of Washington Press, 2003, p. 28</ref> Building on the relationship between quilting and musical performance, African-American quilter Gwendolyn Ann Magee created a twelve-piece exhibition based on the lyrics of [[James Weldon Johnson]]'s "[[Lift Every Voice and Sing]]," commonly known as the "Negro National Anthem."<ref>Moye, Dorothy.

[[Brooklyn Museum]]]] Pictorial quilts are interesting in that they often contain one-of-a-kind patterns and imagery. Instead of bringing together fabric in an abstract or patterned design, they use pieces of fabric to create objects on the quilt, resulting in an picture-based quilt. They were often made collaboratively as a fundraising effort. However, some pictorial quilts were individually created and tell a narrative through the images on the quilt. Some pictorial quilts consist of many squares, sometimes made by multiple people, while others have imagery that utilizes the entirety of quilt. Pictorial quilts were created in the United States, as well as in England and Ireland, beginning as early as 1795.<ref>{{cite web|title=Collections: Browse Objects: Pictorial Quilt|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/51526/Pictorial_Quilt/set/?referring-q=quilt#|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Brooklyn Museum: Shop|url=http://shop.brooklynmuseum.org/worktbyhand.html|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> [[File:Pictorial Quilt.jpg|thumb|left|American. Pictorial Quilt, ca. 1840. Cotton, cotton thread. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]  ====Hawaiian==== {{main|Hawaiian quilt}} [[File:Hawaiian Applique Quilt 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Hawaiian quilt.]] [[Hawaiian quilt]]s are wholecloth (not pieced) quilts, featuring large-scale symmetrical appliqué in solid colors on a solid color (usually white) background fabric. Traditionally, the quilter would fold a square piece of fabric into quarters or eighths and then cut out a border design, followed by a center design.  The cutouts would then be appliquéd onto a contrasting background fabric. The center and border designs were typically inspired by local flora and often had rich personal associations for the creator, with deep cultural resonances. The most common color for the appliquéd design was red, due to the wide availability of [[alizarin|Turkey-red]] fabric.<ref>1990: Susanna Pfeffer. "Quilt Masterpieces" Outlet Book Company, Inc. ISBN 0-517-03297-X</ref> Some of these textiles were not in fact quilted but were used as decorative coverings without the heavier batting, which was not needed in a tropical climate.  Multiple colors were added over time as the tradition developed.  Echo quilting, where a quilted outline of the appliqué pattern is repeated like ripples out to the edge of the quilt, is the most common quilting pattern employed on Hawaiian-style quilts. Beautiful examples are held in the collection of the Bernice Pauahi [[Bishop Museum]], Honolulu, Hawaii.  ====Native American star quilts==== [[Star Quilts]] are a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native-American]] form of quilting that arose among native women in the late 19th century as communities adjusted to the difficulties of reservation life and cultural disruption. They are made by many tribes, but came to be especially associated with Plains tribes, including the [[Lakota people|Lakota]]. While star patterns existed in earlier European-American forms of quilting, they came to take on special significance for many native artisans.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE GRANDEST QUILTED STAR OF ALL|url=http://www.historyofquilts.com/lonestar.html|publisher=Judy Anne Breneman|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Star quilts are more than an art form—they express important cultural and spiritual values of the native women who make them and continue to be used in ceremonies and to mark important points in a person's life, including curing or [[yuwipi]] ceremonies and memorials. Anthropologists (such as [[Bea Medicine]]) have documented important social and cultural connections between quilting and earlier important pre-reservation crafting traditions, such as women's [[quill-working societies]]<ref>Lakota Star Quilts: Commodity, Ceremony, and Economic Development; Bea Medicine; To Honor and Comfort; Museum of New Mexico Press, 1997; Read more: Native American Star Quilt History</ref> and other crafts that were difficult to sustain after hunting and off-reservation travel was restricted by the US government. Star quilts have also become a source of income for many Native-American women, while retaining spiritual and cultural importance to their makers.  ====Seminole==== [[File:Seminole patchwork shawl.jpg|left|thumb|[[Seminole patchwork]] shawl made by Susie Cypress from [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]], ca. 1980s]]  Created by the Native Americans of southern Florida, Seminole strip piecing is based on a simple form of decorative patchwork. Seminole strip piecing has uses in quilts, wall hangings, and traditional clothing. Seminole patchwork is created by joining a series of horizontal strips to produce repetitive geometric designs.  European quilts  The [[history of quilting]] in Europe goes back at least to Medieval times. Quilting was used not only for traditional bedding but also for warm clothing. Clothing quilted with fancy fabrics and threads was often a sign of nobility.  ====British quilts==== [[Henry VIII of England]]'s [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|household inventories]] record dozens of "quyltes" and "coverpointes" among the bed linen, including a green silk one for his first wedding to [[Catherine of Aragon]], quilted with metal threads, linen-backed, and worked with [[rose]]s and [[pomegranates]].<ref name="lisa">{{Citation | last = Evans| first = Lisa| title = History of Medieval & Renaissance Quilting | url= http://www.historyofquilts.com/precolonial.html | accessdate = 2010-06-02}}</ref>  Otherwise known as [[Durham, England|Durham]] quilts, North Country quilts have a long history in northeastern England, dating back to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and beyond. North Country quilts are often wholecloth quilts, featuring dense quilting. Some are made of sateen fabrics, which further heightens the effect of the quilting.  From the late 18th to the early 20th century, the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry produced quilts using a mechanized technique of weaving [[double cloth]] with an enclosed heavy cording weft, imitating the corded [[Provençal quilts]] made in [[Marseilles]].<ref name="north">{{Citation | title = Quilting - see, trapunto, Quilting in the North Country, Needlework through the Ages | url= http://arts.jrank.org/pages/9841/Quilting.html| accessdate = 2010-05-02}}</ref>  ====Italian quilts==== Quilting was particularly common in Italy during the [[Renaissance]]. One particularly famous surviving example, now in two parts, is the 1360-1400 [[Tristan Quilt]], a [[Sicily|Sicilian]]-quilted linen textile representing scenes from the story of ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]'' and housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and in the [[Bargello]] in Florence.<ref name="tristan">[http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O98183/bed-cover-the-tristan-quilt/ The Tristan Quilt] in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

Two layers of fabric are quilted together with stuffing sandwiched between sections of the design, creating a raised effect.<ref name="isa">{{Citation | last = Etienne-Bugnot| first = Isabelle| title = Quilting in France: The French Traditions | url= http://www.historyofquilts.com/french_quilt_history.html | accessdate = 2010-05-02}}</ref> The three main forms of the Provençal quilt are ''matelassage'' (a double-layered wholecloth quilt with batting sandwiched between), corded quilting or ''piqûre de Marseille'' (also known as Marseilles work or ''piqué marseillais''), and ''boutis''.<ref name="isa" /> These terms are often debated and confused, but are all forms of stuffed quilting associated with the region.<ref name="isa" />  ===Other nations===  ====Kuna: Mola textiles==== [[File:KunaWomanSellingMolas.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mola textiles]] {{Further|Mola (art form)}} Mola textiles are a distinct tradition created by the Kuna people of Panama and Colombia. They are famous for their bright colors and reverse appliqué techniques, which create designs with strong cultural and spiritual importance within the indigenous culture. Forms of animals, humans, or mythological figures are featured, with strong geometric designs in the voids around the main image. These textiles are not traditionally used as bedding, but use techniques common to the larger international quilting tradition. Molas have been very influential on modern quilting design.  ====China==== [[File:Quilt making 13.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A lattice of thread is being created atop a layer of batting.]] Throughout China, a simple method of producing quilts is employed. It involves setting up a temporary site. At the site, a frame is assembled within which a lattice work of cotton thread is made. Cotton batting, either new or retrieved from discarded quilts, is prepared in a mobile carding machine. The mechanism of the carding machine is powered by a small, petrol motor. The batting is then added, layer by layer, to the area within the frame. Between each layer, a new lattice of thread is created with a wooden disk used to tamp down the layer. (See: [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Quilting_in_Haikou Image series showing production method])  ====Japan: Sashiko==== [[Sashiko stitching|Sashiko]] (刺し子, literally "little stabs") is a Japanese tradition, that evolved over time from a simple technique for reinforcing fabric made for heavy use in fishing villages. It is a form of decorative stitching, with no overlap of any two stitches. Piecing is not part of the tradition; instead, the focus is on heavy cotton thread work with large, even stitches on the base fabric. Deep blue indigo-dyed fabric with white stitches is the most traditional form, but inverse work with blue on white is also seen. Traditional medallion, tessellated, and geometric designs are the most common.  ====Bangladeshi quilts==== [[File:Nakshi kantha (Flower motif).JPG|thumb|200px|right|Contemporary Bangladeshi Quilt (Kantha).]] Bangladeshi quilts, known as [[Kantha]], are not pieced together. Rather, they consist two to three pieces of cloth sewn together with decorative embroidery stitches. They are made out of worn-out clothes (saris) and are mainly used for bedding, although they may be used as a decorative piece as well. They are made by women mainly in the [[Monsoon]] season before winter.  ====Cook Islands: Tivaevae quilts==== [[Tivaevae]] are quilts made by [[Cook Islands|Cook Island]] women for ceremonial occasions. Quilting is thought to have been imported to the Islands by missionaries. The quilts are highly prized and are given as gifts with other finely made works on important occasions such as weddings and christenings.  ====Ralli quilts==== Women in the Indus Region of the Indian subcontinent make beautiful quilts with bright colors and bold patterns. The quilts are called “[[Ralli quilt|Ralli]]” (or rilli, rilly, rallee, or rehli) derived from the local word "ralanna" meaning to mix or connect. Rallis are made in the southern provinces of [[Pakistan]] including [[Sindh]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Baluchistan]], and in the [[Cholistan Desert]] on the southern border of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], as well as in the adjoining states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]] in [[India]]. Muslim and Hindu women from a variety of tribes and castes in towns, villages, and also nomadic settings make rallis. Quiltmaking is an old tradition in the region perhaps dating back to the fourth millennium BC, judging by similar patterns found on ancient pottery.  Rallis are commonly used as a covering for wooden sleeping cots, as a floor covering, storage bag, or padding for workers or animals. In the villages, ralli quilts are an important part of a girl’s dowry. Owning many ralli quilts is a measure of wealth. Parents present rallis to their daughters on their wedding day as a dowry.  Rallis are made from scraps of cotton fabric dyed to the desired color. The most common colors are white, black, red, and yellow or orange with green, dark blue, or purple. For the bottoms of the rallis, the women use old pieces of [[tie-dye]], [[ajrak]], or other shawl fabric. Ralli quilts have a few layers of worn fabric or cotton fibers between the top and bottom layers. The layers are held together by thick colored thread stitched in straight lines. The women sit on the ground and do not use a quilting frame. Another kind of ralli quilt is the ''sami ralli'', used by the [[samis]] and [[jogis]]. This type of ralli quilt is popular due to the many colors and the extensive hand-stitching employed in its construction.  The number of patterns used on ralli quilts seems to be almost endless, as there is much individual expression and spontaneity in color within the traditional patterns. The three basic styles of rallis are: 1) [[patchwork]] quilts made from pieces of cloth torn into squares and triangles and then stitched together, 2) [[appliqué]] quilts made from intricate cut-out patterns in a variety of shapes, and 3) [[Embroidery|embroidered]] quilts where the embroidery stitches form patterns on solid colored fabric.  A distinguishing feature of ralli patterning in patchwork and appliqué quilts is the diagonal placement of similar blocks as well as a variety of embellishments including mirrors, tassels, shells, and embroidery.<ref>[http://www.ishraqi.com/betav1/ralli-quilt-history/ History of Ralli Quilt]</ref>  ====Egyptian khayamiya==== [[Khayamiya]] is a form of suspended tent decoration or portable textile screen used across North Africa and the Middle East. It is an art form distinctive to Egypt, where they are still sewn by hand in the Street of the Tentmakers (Sharia Khayamiya) in Cairo. Whilst Khayamiya resemble quilts, they typically possess a heavy back layer and fine top layer of appliqué, without a central insulating layer.  ==Block designs== {{Further|Motif (textile arts)}} [[File:Square-in-a-square quilt block.png|thumb|200px|Square-in-a-square quilt block pattern.]] [[File:Kitchen kaleid.PNG|thumb|Kitchen kaleidoscope quilt block example.]] There are many traditional block designs and techniques that have been named. '''Log cabin''' quilts are pieced quilts featuring blocks made of strips of fabric, typically encircling a small centered square (traditionally a red square, symbolizing the hearth of the home), with light strips forming half the square and dark strips the other half. Dramatic contrast effects with light and dark fabrics are created by various layouts of the blocks when joined to form a quilt top. These different layout variations are often named; some layouts include Sunshine and Shadow, Straight Furrows, Streak of Lightning, and Barn Raising. '''Nine-Patch''' blocks are often the first blocks a child is taught to make. The block consists of three rows of three squares. A checkerboard effect with alternating dark and light squares is most commonly used. The '''Double Wedding Ring''' pattern first came to prominence during the [[Great Depression]]. The design consists of interlocking circles pieced with small arcs of fabric. The finished quilts are often given to commemorate marriages. [[File:Double Wedding Ring Quilt.jpg|thumb|left|American. Double Wedding Ring Quilt, ca. 1930. Cotton. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]] '''Cathedral Windows''' is a type of block that features reverse appliqué using large amounts of folded muslin, and consists of modular blocks in an interlocking circular design that frame small squares or diamonds of colorful lightweight cotton. The volume of fabric is high, and the tops are heavy. Because of the weight and the insulating value of the base fabric, these tops often are assembled without batting (and thus need no quilting stitches), and sometimes have no backing. Such a quilt may be called a "counterpane" and may serve mainly as a decorative bedspread.  ==Other terms==  ===Autograph quilts=== [[File:Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum July 2015 14 (ca. 1920 friendship quilt).jpg|thumb|A friendship quilt, circa 1920, at the [[Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum]] in 2015]]  There are two distinct kinds of autograph quilts. Single pattern quilts are often referred to as "friendship quilts" while the more formal quilts made of different blocks are called "sampler album quilts."  Although both kinds of quilt are part of the same tradition of signed remembrances, they differ in how they were created. Sampler album quilts were composed of several unique, intricately pieced or appliquéd blocks. A friendship quilt was usually made of several blocks from the same pattern. These blocks could be made quickly (by each friend involved in the project), from fabric scraps available at her home.  In her Clues in the Needlework newsletter, [[Barbara Brackman]] wrote, "Many of the blocks in the early album quilts made between 1840 and 1860 featured elaborate ink signatures and small drawings and verses. By the time of the Civil War, album quilt inscriptions had become shorter and were more likely to include only the block maker's name, and perhaps his or her hometown or date."  Most 19th-century signatures were written with indelible ink, while in the 20th century they were often embroidered. Occasionally, one person chosen for her beautiful handwriting would inscribe all the signatures. Some regional signature quilts were inscribed in the [[fraktur]] calligraphy used to document important events by the Pennsylvania Germans.  ===Quillow=== A quillow is a quilt with an attached pocket into which the whole blanket can be folded, thus making a pillow. Once folded into the pocket, it can be used as a cushion during the day and unfolded into a blanket at night.  ===T-shirt quilt=== A T-shirt quilt is a quilt made out of T-shirts. Often seen as a keepsake item and made from memorable T-shirts, sweatshirts, or other clothing.  They are popular graduation gifts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lindenfeld Hall|first=Sarah|title=Quilter pieces together people's life stories|url=http://www.wral.com/lifestyles/goaskmom/blogpost/10685346/|publisher=WRAL|date=5 February 2012}}</ref>  ==Quilting technique== {{main|Quilting}}  ==Quilts on display== One of the most famous quilts in history is the [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|AIDS Memorial Quilt]], which was begun in [[San Francisco]] in 1987, and is cared for by [[NAMES Project|The NAMES Project Foundation]]. Portions of it are periodically displayed in various arranged locations. Panels are made to memorialize a person lost to HIV, and each block is 3 feet by 6 feet. Many of the blocks are not made by traditional quilters, and the amateur creators may lack technical skill, but their blocks speak directly to the love and loss they have experienced. The blocks are not in fact quilted, as there is no stitching holding together batting and backing layers. Exuberant designs, with personal objects applied, are seen next to restrained and elegant designs. Each block is very personal, and they form a deeply moving sight when combined by the dozens and the hundreds. The quilt as a whole is still under construction, although the entire quilt is now so large that it cannot be assembled in complete form in any one location.  Beginning with the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]'s 1971 exhibit, ''Abstract Design in American Quilts,'' quilts have frequently appeared on museum and gallery walls. The exhibit displayed quilts like paintings on its gallery walls, which has since become a standard way to exhibit quilts. The Whitney exhibit helped shift the perception of quilts from solely a domestic craft object to art objects, increasing art world interest in them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=International Quilt Study Center & Museum|title=Abstract Design in American Quilts|url=http://worldquilts.quiltstudy.org/americanstory/creativity/abstractdesign|website=World Quilts: The American Story|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref>  The [[Museum of the American Quilter's Society]] (also known as the National Quilt Museum) is located in [[Paducah, Kentucky]]. The museum houses a large collection of quilts, most of which are winning entries from the annual American Quilter's Society festival and quilt competition held in April. The museum also houses other exhibits of quilt collections, both historic and modern.

The San Jose Museum of Quilts and Textiles in California also displays traditional and modern quilts. There is free admission to the museum on the first Friday of every month, as part of the San Jose Art Walk.  The [[New England Quilt Museum]] is located in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]].  The Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum is located in [[Golden, Colorado]].
