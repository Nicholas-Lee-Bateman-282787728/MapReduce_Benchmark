   Overtime is a method of extending an ice hockey game when the scores are tied after regulation. The two main methods of extending the game are the overtime period (commonly referred to as overtime) and the shootout. Depending upon league rules, the game's winning team may or may not be necessarily determined. Overtime periods are extra periods beyond the third regulation period during a game, where normal hockey rules apply.  Although in the past, full-length overtime periods were played, overtimes today are golden goal (a form of sudden death), meaning that the game ends immediately when a player scores a goal. From November 21, 1942,NHL Guide when overtime was eliminated due to war time restrictions and continuing until the 1983–84 season, all NHL regular-season games tied after 60 minutes of play ended as ties. On June 23, 1983, the NHL introduced a regular-season overtime period of five minutes. If the five-minute overtime period ended with no scoring, the game ended as a tie (the World Hockey Association had used a 10-minute regular season overtime period, as had the NHL prior to World War II). In the first games to go to overtime, on October 5, 1983, the Minnesota North Stars and Los Angeles Kings skated to a 3–3 tie, and the Detroit Red Wings and Winnipeg Jets tied 6–6. The first regular-season game decided by overtime was on October 8, 1983, as the New York Islanders beat the Washington Capitals 8–7. In 1987–88 and since 1995, the American Hockey League has awarded teams one point in the standings for an overtime loss (OTL). In 1998, the AHL introduced a rule where teams will play the five-minute overtime period with four skaters and a goaltender, rather than at full strength (five skaters), except in two-man advantage situations.  In a two-man advantage situation, the team with the advantage will play with five skaters against three skaters.  The rule was popular and adopted by the NHL and ECHL the next season. Jaromír Jágr has the most regular season overtime goals with 17. In the Stanley Cup playoffs, overtime periods are played like regulation periods except for the golden goal rule; the teams are at full strength (five skaters, barring penalties), there is no shootout, and each overtime period is 20 minutes with full intermissions between overtime periods. Interestingly, three of the game's legendary players, Mark Messier (109 playoff goals), Mario Lemieux (77 goals), and Gordie Howe (68 goals) never scored a playoff overtime goal. Overtime periods are played without commercial breaks. In many leagues (including the NHL for regular-season games since the 2005–06 season) and in international competitions, a failure to reach a decision in a single overtime may lead to a shootout.  Some leagues may eschew overtime periods altogether and end games in shootout should teams be tied at the end of regulation.  In the three major North American professional hockey leagues (NHL, AHL, and ECHL), regular season overtime periods are played four on four for one five-minute period.  In the Southern Professional Hockey League, regular season overtime periods are played three on three for one five-minute period, with penalties resulting in the opponents skating one additional player on ice (up to two additional players) for the penalty for the first three minutes, and a penalty shot in the final two minutes.  The AHL, since the 2014–15 season, extended the overtime to seven minutes, with the last three minutes reduced further to three men aside and teams getting an additional skater for each opponent's penalty. The idea of using 3-on-3 skaters for the entirety of a five-minute overtime period for a regular season game was adopted by the NHL on June 24, 2015, to be used in the 2015-16 NHL season. In international competition, shootouts (or more formally, game-winning shots (GWS), and, in some European countries, bullets, or bullits,Jeff Z. Klein, "Hockey Night in Europe: Goodbye, Columbus,” New York Times, October 25, 2008.V. Lychyk, “English borrowings in recent Soviet Russian,” Papers and Studies in Contrastive Linguistics 29 (1994), p. 153.), are often used.  Each coach selects three skaters from their team to take penalty shots one at a time against the opposing goaltender, with teams alternating shots. Each team gets one shot per round. The winner is the team with more goals after three rounds or the team that amasses an unreachable advantage before then (ex. a team gains a two-goal lead with only one round left). If the shootout is tied after three rounds, tie-breaker rounds are played one at a time (with each team taking one additional shot) until there is a winner. The IIHF first adopted the game-winning-shot procedure in 1992 when a new playoff procedure in the Winter Olympics and World Championships required a winner for each game. At that time, the shootout was five rounds and only used for knock-out games. In 2006, it was reduced to three rounds and used for all games, eliminating the possibility of tied games at IIHF events. Tie-breaker rounds are still used as needed, and the same or new players can take the tie-break shots, which is also done in reverse order. Most lower minor leagues (ECHL, Central, UHL) have featured a shootout where, at the end of regulation, a shootout similar to the international tournament format is used. However, in 2000, the ECHL adopted the AHL's four-on-four overtime before the shootout. For the 2004–05 AHL season, the AHL adopted a five-man shootout, which was first used in that league in 1986–87.  The standard five-man shootout is used after four-on-four overtime for all minor leagues in North America. The AHL switched to the NHL formatted three-man shootout for the 2014–15 season.http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/hockeyozone/2014/07/10/ot-in-ahl-now-7-minutes/12485519/ The Central Collegiate Hockey Association is adding the shootout with effect from the 2008–09 season. Following the lead of minor leagues, as of the 2005–06 season, the NHL ends exhibition and regular season games still tied after a five-minute-length, three-skaters-per-side overtime period with a shootout. The NHL format is a three-round shootout with tiebreaker rounds as needed. All skaters (except goalies) on a team's roster must shoot before any player can shoot a second time. The shootout is not used in the playoffs for any North American league. Instead, full 20-minute overtime periods are played until one team scores a goal. In the National Hockey League and American Hockey League All-Star Skills Competitions, the competition ends in a penalty shootout known as the Breakaway Relay. Tactics are very important during penalty shots and overtime shootouts for both the shooter and the goalie.  Both shooters and goalies commonly consult their teammates and coaches for advice on the opposing player's style of play.  Shooters often consider the goalie's strengths and weaknesses (such as a fast glove or stick save), preferred goaltending style (such as butterfly or stand-up) and method of challenging the shooter.  Goaltenders often consider the shooter's shot preference, expected angle of attack, a patented move a shooter commonly uses and even handedness of the shooter. Most shooters attempt to out-deke the goalie in order to create a better scoring chance. Minnesota Wild forward Mikko Koivu and New York Rangers forward Martin St. Louis are examples of players who commonly use this tactic.  However, it is not uncommon for a shooter to simply shoot for an opening without deking.  This is commonly referred to as sniping.  This is most commonly performed when a goalie challenges a shooter by giving them an open hole (by keeping a glove, pad or stick out of position or being out of sound goaltending position altogether to tempt the shooter to aim for the given opening). Former NHL forwards Markus Näslund and Brett Hull are two players commonly referred to as snipers.  Very rarely a shooter may take a slapshot or wrist shot from the point or top of the slot.  This is almost exclusively performed when a shooter either has a high level of confidence in their shot or they attempt to catch the goalie by surprise.  Retired player Brian Rolston, Detroit Red Wings winger Todd Bertuzzi, Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Chris Pronger, and Vancouver Canucks winger Daniel Sedin have all used this tactic with success. This is a list of all National Hockey League (NHL) overtime games that went into at least three overtimes (winning team is bold). *Stanley Cup Finals game **Stanley Cup winning goal ***This was the second game of a two-game total-goals series.

ends the longest Stanley Cup playoff game to date, scoring the game's only goal in a 1–0 victory over the Montreal Maroons. The goal comes 16:30 into the sixth overtime period for a total of 176:30 of game play. It is also the longest NHL ice hockey game ever played. The game is a mere 3:30 short of the equivalent of playing three games back-to-back-to-back. April 2, 1939: The Boston Bruins' Mel Hill scores his third overtime goal of the Bruins' Stanley Cup semi-final series against the New York Rangers, setting an unsurpassed (as of 2015) NHL record for most overtime goals in a single playoff series, earning him the nickname thereafter of "Sudden Death" Hill. The series itself involves four overtime games, two of which go to a third overtime period. April 23, 1950: Pete Babando scores at 8:31 of second overtime to give the Detroit Red Wings a 4–3 win in the seventh game of the 1950 Stanley Cup Finals over the New York Rangers.  It is the first time that a seventh game of a Final series goes to overtime. April 21, 1951: Bill Barilko scores at 2:53 of overtime to give the Toronto Maple Leafs a 3–2 win in the fifth game of the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals over the Montreal Canadiens.  All five games in the series need to have overtime to be decided. April 16, 1954: Tony Leswick's shot hit Montreal Canadiens' defenceman Doug Harvey's glove and went into the net at 4:20 of overtime to give the Detroit Red Wings a 2–1 win in the seventh game of the 1954 Stanley Cup Finals over the Canadiens. No seventh game of a Final series has gone to overtime since. April 23, 1964: Bobby Baun of the Toronto Maple Leafs nets a game winner against Detroit 1:43 into overtime in game six of the Finals to tie the series 3–all.  The goal is notable because Baun broke his ankle earlier in the game.  It was frozen and taped, and Baun returned to the ice to score the winning goal. May 10, 1970: One of the most indelible moments in sports history is the sight of Bobby Orr's "in flight" goal that gave the Boston Bruins a 4–3 win and a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Blues in the Stanley Cup Finals. May 24, 1980: Bob Nystrom of the New York Islanders scores the Stanley Cup clinching goal at 7:11 of overtime, eliminating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games. April 10, 1982: "Miracle on Manchester"&nbsp;– Rookie Daryl Evans gives the Los Angeles Kings a 6–5 win over the Edmonton Oilers at 2:35 of overtime.  The Kings had trailed the Oilers 5–0 after the second period of game three of the Smythe Division Semi-final. This still remains the largest single game playoff comeback in NHL history. May 12, 1986: Doug Wickenheiser's overtime goal gives the St. Louis Blues a 6–5 win over the Calgary Flames in game six of the Campbell Conference Final. The goal, known as the "Monday Night Miracle", caps a 5–2 comeback and makes it more impressive that the three goals needed to tie the game were scored in the last ten minutes of the third period. May 18, 1986: A Brian Skrudland goal ends the shortest overtime in NHL history at just nine seconds.  The winning goal gives the Montreal Canadiens a 3–2 victory over the Calgary Flames in game two of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals. April 18, 1987: "Easter Epic"&nbsp;– Pat LaFontaine of New York Islanders scores a goal against Washington Capitals at 8:47 of the fourth overtime period which ends the longest game seven in NHL playoff history. Islanders goaltender Kelly Hrudey makes a record 73 saves. May 15, 1990: After hardly playing in overtime, Petr Klima came off the bench late in the third overtime period and scored almost immediately to end the longest overtime in NHL Finals history.  The goal gave the Edmonton Oilers a 3–2 victory over the Boston Bruins in game one of the 1990 Stanley Cup Finals, setting the stage for the Oilers' fifth cup in seven years. April 24, 1993: In game four of the Stanley Cup division semi-final between the Buffalo Sabres and the Boston Bruins, Sabres forward Brad May scores in overtime to give Buffalo a 6–5 win and sweep the Bruins in the series, four games to none.  Due to Buffalo commentator Rick Jeanneret's colorful play call when May scored, this game has been referred to in Buffalo as "May Day". 1993: After losing in overtime of game one of the Adams division semi-final to the Quebec Nordiques, the Montreal Canadiens go on to win ten consecutive overtime games en route to winning the Stanley Cup. The Habs score another overtime winner the following year against the Boston Bruins, making it eleven consecutive playoff overtime wins. April 27, 1994: Dominik Hasek of the Buffalo Sabres stops all 70 shots produced by the New Jersey Devils as Dave Hannan scores the lone goal over a sprawling Martin Brodeur at 5:43 of the fourth overtime period in game six of the first-round matchup. April 30, 1994: Pavel Bure scores 2:20 into double overtime of the seventh game of the opening round of Vancouver's playoff series with Calgary.  The win gives the Vancouver Canucks three consecutive overtime wins over the favored Calgary Flames, who squander a 3–1 series lead. May 27, 1994: Stephane Matteau scores the game-winning goal at 4:24 of double overtime with a wrap-around, beating Martin Brodeur and the New Jersey Devils in game seven, advancing the New York Rangers to the Stanley Cup Finals (where they would ultimately win it for the first time since 1940).  It is Matteau's second goal in double overtime periods of the series. April 24, 1996: Petr Nedved scores with 44.6 seconds remaining in quadruple overtime to give the Pittsburgh Penguins a 3–2 win over the Washington Capitals to tie their Eastern Conference quarter-final series at two games apiece. June 10, 1996: Uwe Krupp became the 12th player in NHL history to end the Stanley Cup Finals in overtime, scoring a goal at 4:31 of triple overtime, giving the Colorado Avalanche a 1–0 win and a sweep of the Florida Panthers. June 19, 1999: Brett Hull scores with 5:09 left in triple overtime of game six to win the Stanley Cup for the Dallas Stars over the Buffalo Sabres. The goal is especially controversial and is known by fans as "No Goal" (see 1999 Stanley Cup Finals). May 4, 2000: Keith Primeau of the Philadelphia Flyers put a shot over the left shoulder of Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Ron Tugnutt with 7:59 remaining in quintuple overtime, ending the longest game since 1936. June 10, 2000: Jason Arnott scores on Dallas Stars' goalie Ed Belfour in double overtime of game six to give the New Jersey Devils their second Stanley Cup. April 11, 2007: Roberto Luongo, goaltender for the Vancouver Canucks, wins his first career playoff game while making 72 saves, one shy of Kelly Hrudey's record. The game is the sixth longest ever, going into quadruple overtime. Henrik Sedin scores the winning goal in the Western Quarterfinals, beating the Dallas Stars 5–4 in game 1. The game is Vancouver's longest in history, and the Star's second longest, behind their five-overtime loss to Anaheim in 2003. March 22, 2008: Philip Gogulla of the Cologne Sharks ends the longest German hockey game ever and the second longest worldwide, scoring the ninth-overall goal in a 5:4 victory over the Mannheim Eagles. The goal comes 8:16 into the sixth overtime period for a total of 108:16 of overtime. It is the third quarter-final game (best of seven) in the Kölnarena in Cologne in front of an audience of 17,000. The game had begun at 5:30&nbsp;pm and ends at 12:15&nbsp;am. May 4, 2008: Brenden Morrow scores on San Jose Sharks goalie Evgeni Nabokov at 9:03 of quadruple overtime in game six of the Western Conference Semi-final between the Sharks and Stars. The game sees an incredible goaltending duel as Nabokov makes 53 saves in the loss while Marty Turco of Dallas makes 61 saves for the win. June 2, 2008: In game five of the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, the Pittsburgh Penguins' Petr Sykora told Pierre Maguire of NBC that he would score the winning goal in overtime. At 9:57 of triple overtime, Sykora scored on Detroit Red Wings' goaltender Chris Osgood and sent the series back to Pittsburgh for game six. June 9, 2010: Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks shoots a goal past Philadelphia Flyers goalie Michael Leighton 4:10 into overtime of game six of the Stanley Cup Finals to give the Blackhawks a 4–3 win over the Flyers for their first Stanley Cup Championship since 1961. April 26, 2011: Alexandre Burrows of the Vancouver Canucks scored at 5:22 of overtime past Corey Crawford of the Chicago Blackhawks to win the series 4–3 and the game 2–1, sending the Canucks to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, avoiding squandering a 3–0 series lead and a 1–0 lead in game seven in the third period. June 4, 2011: Another Alexandre Burrows goal ends the second-shortest overtime in NHL history at just eleven seconds. The winning goal gives the Vancouver Canucks a 3–2 victory over the Boston Bruins in game two of the Stanley Cup Finals. May 25, 2012: Adam Henrique of the New Jersey Devils scored at 1:03 into overtime past Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers in game six of the Eastern Conference Final to send the Devils to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 2003. May 13, 2013: Patrice Bergeron of the Boston Bruins scored at 6:05 of overtime past James Reimer of the Toronto Maple Leafs to win the series 4–3 and the game 5–4, to send the Bruins to the Conference Semi–finals to face the New York Rangers. It also capped a historic comeback in a game seven, coming back from a three-goal hole in the third period. With fifty–one seconds to go, they tied the game at four. The tying goal was also scored by Patrice Bergeron. The 2012–13 Boston Bruins became the first team in NHL history to do this in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. June 5, 2013: Patrice Bergeron of the Boston Bruins scored at 15:19 of double overtime past Tomas Vokoun of the Pittsburgh Penguins to give the Boston Bruins a 3–0 series lead in the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals. June 12, 2013: Andrew Shaw scored with 7:52 left in the third overtime period to give the Chicago Blackhawks a 4–3 win over the Boston Bruins in game one of the Stanley Cup Finals, ending the fifth-longest game in Stanley Cup Finals history. June 13, 2014: Alec Martinez scored with 5:17 left in double overtime in game five of the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, becoming the 16th player to win the Stanley Cup with an overtime goal as the Los Angeles Kings beat the New York Rangers 3–2, clinching the series 4–1. He has the distinction of scoring two series-clinching playoff overtime goals in the same season; on June 1, he scored 5:47 into overtime to defeat the Chicago Blackhawks 5–4 in game seven of the Western Conference Finals. May 13, 2015: Derek Stepan scored with 8:36 left in the first overtime in game seven in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals against the Washington Capitals to send the New York Rangers to the Eastern Conference Finals. This game is well known for Alex Ovechkin guaranteeing a victory before the game. The Capitals also had a 3–1 series lead before losing the final three games and ultimately losing the series. May 19, 2015: Marcus Krüger scored with 3:48 left in the third overtime in game two of the Western Conference Finals, as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the Anaheim Ducks, 3–2, tying the series at 1–1. This was Anaheim's first playoff loss at home that season and Chicago's longest overtime game to date. Chicago goalie Corey Crawford made 60 saves while defenceman Duncan Keith played seconds shy of 50 minutes on ice. Earlier in the second overtime period, Andrew Shaw used his head to direct the puck into the net, but the goal did not count.
