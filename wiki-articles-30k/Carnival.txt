     Carnival (see other spellings and names) is a Croatian festive season that occurs before the Christian season of Lent. The main events typically occur during February or early March. Carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus, masks and public street party. People wear masks during many such celebrations, an overturning of life's normal things. The celebrations have long been associated with heavy alcohol consumption. Many synods and councils attempted to set things "right". The statements of Caesarius of Arles (470–542), which protested around 500 CE in his sermons against the Pagan practices, seemed to have formed the building blocks of the Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum (small index of superstitious and pagan practices), which was drafted by the Synod of Leptines in 742 in which the Spurcalibus en februario was condemned. Pope Gregory the Great (590–604) decided that fasting would start on Ash Wednesday. The whole Carnaval event was set before the fasting, to set a clear division between the pagan and the Christian custom. It was also the custom during Carnaval that the ruling class would be mocked using masks and disguises. The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence. However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939, the last carnival in the country. In historically Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday. In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent.  In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11&nbsp;a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day. Rio de Janeiro's carnival is considered the world's largest, hosting approximately two million participants per day. In 2004, Rio's carnival attracted a record 400,000 foreign visitors.Guinness World Records    The Latin-derived name of the holiday is sometimes also spelled Carnaval, typically in areas where Dutch, German, French, Spanish, and Portuguese are spoken, or Carnevale in Italian-speaking contexts. Alternate names are used for regional and local celebrations. The origin may be from the Italian word "carne" (meat) or "carrus" (car). The former suggests an origin within Christianity, while the alternative links to earlier religions. Folk etymologies state that the word comes from the Late Latin expression carne vale, which means "farewell to meat", signifying the approaching fast. The word carne may also be translated as flesh, producing "a farewell to the flesh", a phrase embraced by certain Carnival celebrants to embolden the festival's carefree spirit. However, this interpretation is not supported by philological evidence. The Italian carne levare is one possible origin, meaning "to remove meat", since meat is prohibited during Lent. Other scholars argue for the origin from the Roman name for the festival of the Navigium Isidis (ship of Isis), where the image of Isis was carried to the seashore to bless the start of sailing season. The festival consisted of a parade of masks following an adorned wooden boat, possibly source of the floats of modern Carnivals.Di Cocco (2007) Chapter II, pages.23–40Valantasis (2000) p.378 From an anthropological point of view, carnival is a reversal ritual, in which social roles are reversed and norms about desired behavior are suspended.Carnaval.

Carnival can thus be regarded as a rite of passage from darkness to light, from winter to summer: a fertility celebration, the first spring festival of the new year.Vitaberna. Jansimons.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015. Traditionally a carnival feast was the last opportunity to eat well before the time of food shortage at the end of the winter during which one was limited to the minimum necessary.  On what nowadays is called vastenavond (the days before fasting) all the remaining winter stores of lard, butter and meat which were left would be eaten, for it would soon start to rot and decay. The selected livestock had in fact already been slaughtered in November and the meat would be no longer preservable. All the food that had survived the winter had to be eaten to assure that everyone was fed enough to survive until the coming spring would provide new food sources.Wat is carnaval? | Fen Vlaanderen.

Before Lent began, all rich food and drink were consumed in what became a giant celebration that involved the whole community, and is thought to be the origin of Carnival. The Lenten period of the Liturgical calendar, the six weeks directly before Easter, was originally marked by fasting and other pious or penitential practices. During Lent, no parties or celebrations were held, and people refrained from eating rich foods, such as meat, dairy, fat and sugar.Gaignebet, Claude. 1984. El Carnaval: Ensayos de mitologia popular. Barcelona: Editorial Alta Fulla. Original edition, Le carnaval. Essais de mythologie populaire, Editions Payot, Paris, 1974. While christian festivals such as corpus christi were church-sanctioned celebrations, Carnival was also a manifestation of European folk culture. Many synods and councils attempted to set things "right". The statements of Caesarius of Arles (470–542), which protested around 500 CE in his sermons against the Pagan practices, seemed to have formed the building blocks of the Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum (small index of superstitious and pagan practices), which was drafted by the Synod of Leptines in 742 in which the Spurcalibus en februario was condemned.[14][18] Pope Gregory the Great (590–604) decided that fasting would start on Ash Wednesday. The whole Carnaval event was set before the fasting, to set a clear division between the pagan and the Christian custom. It was also the custom during Carnaval that the ruling class would be mocked using masks and disguises.[14][18] In the Christian tradition the fasting is to commemorate the 40 days that Jesus fasted in the desert according to the New Testament and also to reflect on Christian values. As with many other Christian festivals such as Christmas which was originally a pagan midwinter festival, the Christian church has found it easier to turn the pagan Carnaval in a catholic tradition than to eliminate it.  Unlike today, carnival in the Middle Ages took not just a few days, but it covered almost the entire period between Christmas and the beginning of Lent. In those two months, several Catholic holidays were seized by the Catholic population as an outlet for their daily frustrations. In many Christian sermons and texts, the example of a vessel used to explain Christian doctrine: "the nave of the church of baptism", "the ship of Mary", etc.  The writings show that processions with ship-like carts were held and lavish feasts were celebrated on the eve of lent or the greeting of spring in the early Middle Ages. The catholic church condemned this "devilish debauchery" and "pagan rituals". As early as the year 325 the council of Nicaea attempted to end these pagan festivals. Many synods and councils attempted to set things "right". The statements of Caesarius of Arles (470–542), which protested around 500 CE in his sermons against the Pagan practices, seemed to have formed the building blocks of the Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum (small index of superstitious and pagan practices), which was drafted by the Synod of Leptines in 742 in which the Spurcalibus en februario was condemned. Pope Gregory the Great (590–604) decided that fasting would start on Ash Wednesday. The whole Carnaval event was set before the fasting, to set a clear division between the pagan and the Christian custom. It was also the custom during Carnaval that the ruling class would be mocked using masks and disguises. In the year 743 the synod in Leptines (Leptines is located near Binche in Belgium) spoke out furiously against the excesses in the month of February. Also from the same period dates the phrase: "Whoever in February by a variety of less honorable acts tries to drive out winter is not a Christian, but a pagan." Confession books from around 800 contain more information about how people would dress as an animal or old woman during the festivities in January and February. Noticing that on it was no small penance.Oorsprong Carnaval : Middencommiteit Lommel. Middencommiteit.be. Retrieved on 13 May 2015. Also in Spain, San Isidoro de Sevilla is written complaint in the seventh century that people coming out into the streets disguised in many cases the opposite gender. Gradually the ecclesiastical authority began to realize that the desired result could not be attained by banning the traditions, which eventually led to a degree of christianization. The festivities became part of the liturgy and the liturgical year. While forming an integral part of the Christian calendar, particularly in Catholic regions, many Carnival traditions resemble those antedating Christianity. Italian Carnival is sometimes thought to be derived from the ancient Roman festivals of Saturnalia and Bacchanalia. The Saturnalia, in turn, may be based on the Greek Dionysia and Oriental festivals. While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned, Carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture. Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian–Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals.Saturnalia These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life.Erickson, Brad. 2008. Sensory Politics: Catalan Ritual and the New Immigration. University of California at Berkeley. The commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root. Christ's passion is itself grotesque: Jesus is the victim of summary judgement and is tortured and executed before a mob. Holy Week processions in Spain include crowds who vociferously insult the figure of Jesus. Irreverence, parody, degradation and laughter at a tragicomic God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order.Delgado Ruiz, Manuel. 2001. Luces iconoclastas: Anticlericalism, espacio, y ritual en la España contemporánia, Ariel Antropología. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel. Some of the best-known traditions, including carnal parades and masquerade balls, were first recorded in medieval Italy. The carnival of Venice was, for a long time, the most famous carnival (although Napoleon abolished it in 1797 and only in 1979 was the tradition restored). From Italy, Carnival traditions spread to Spain, Portugal and France and from France to New France in North America. From Spain and Portugal it spread with colonization to the Caribbean and Latin America. In the early 19th century in the German Rhineland and Southern Netherlands, the weakened medieval tradition also revive. In Rhineland in 1823, the first modern Carnival parade took place in Cologne, Germany. The upper Rhineland is mostly Protestant, as is most of Northern Germany and Northern Europe. Carneval, (Fasching or Fastnacht in Germany) mixed pagan traditions with Christian traditions. Pre-Lenten celebrations featured parades, costumes and masks to endure Lent's withdrawal from worldly pleasures. Other areas developed their own traditions. In the United Kingdom, West Indian immigrants brought with them the traditions of Caribbean Carnival, however the Carnivals now celebrated at Notting Hill, London; Leeds, Yorkshire, and other places became divorced from their religious origin and became secular events that take place in the summer months.  Interpretations of Carnival present it as a social institution that offers an alternative to the seriousness of daily life beyond a simple respite,Bakhtin, Mikhail. 1984. Rabelais and his world.

Some Belgian cities hold Carnivals during Lent. One of the best-known is [[Stavelot]], where the ''Carnival de la Laetare'' takes place on [[Laetare Sunday]], the fourth Sunday of Lent. The participants include the ''Blancs-Moussis'', who dress in white, carry long red noses and parade through town attacking bystanders with [[confetti]] and dried [[pig bladder]]s. The town of [[Halle, Belgium#Events|Halle]] also celebrates on Laetare Sunday. Belgium's oldest parade is the [[Carnival Parade of Maaseik]], also held on Laetare Sunday, which originated in 1865.  ====Bosnia and Herzegovina==== In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the city of [[Ljubuški]] holds a traditional Carnival ({{lang-bs|Karneval}}). Ljubuški is a member of the [[Federation of European Carnival Cities]] (FECC).  ====Croatia==== The most famous Croatian Carnival (Croatian: "karneval", also called "maškare") is the [[Rijeka Carnival]], during which the mayor of [[Rijeka]] hands over the keys to the city to the Carnival master ("meštar od karnevala"). The festival includes several events, culminating on the final Sunday in a masked procession. (A similar procession for children takes place on the previous day.) [[File:Međimurski fašnjak 2011.- Kvitrovečki maškori.JPG|left|220px|thumb|"Carnival of [[Međimurje]]", northern Croatia (2011)]]  Many towns in Croatia's [[Kvarner]] region (and in other parts of the country) observe the Carnival period, incorporating local traditions and celebrating local culture. Just before the end of Carnival, every Kvarner town burns a [[effigy|man-like doll]] called a "Jure Piškanac", who is blamed for all the strife of the previous year. The [[Zvončari]], or bell-ringers, wear bells and large head regalia representing their areas of origin (for example, those from Halubje wear regalia in the shape of animal heads). The traditional Carnival food is [[fritule]], a pastry. This festival can also be called Poklade.  Masks are worn to many of the festivities, including concerts and parties. Children and teachers are commonly allowed to wear masks to school for a day, and also wear masks at school dances or while trick-or-treating. Carnivals also take place in summer. One of the most famous is the Senj Summer Carnival – first celebrated in 1968. The towns of [[Cres]], Pag, Novi Vinodolski and Fužine also organise Summer Carnivals.  ====Cyprus==== Carnival has been celebrated for centuries. The tradition was likely established under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule around the 16th century. It may have been influenced by Greek traditions, such as festivities for deities such as [[Dionysus]]. The celebration originally involved dressing in costumes and holding masked balls or visiting friends. In the twentieth century it became an organized event held during the 10 days preceding Lent (according to the [[Greek Orthodox]] calendar). The festival is celebrated almost exclusively in the city of [[Limassol]].  Three main parades take place during Carnival. The first is held on the first day, during which the "Carnival King" (either a person in costume or an [[effigy]]) rides through the city on his carriage. The second is held on the first Sunday of the festival and the participants are mainly children. The third and largest takes place on the last day of Carnival and involves hundreds of people walking in costume along the town's longest avenue. The latter two parades are open to anyone who wishes to participate.  ====Czech Republic==== [[File:Masopust masks in Milevsku (2013) 63.JPG|thumb|Masopust masks in Czech Republic, 2013]] In the Czech Republic, the Masopust Festival takes place from [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (''Den tří králů'') through Ash Wednesday (''Popeleční středa''). The word ''masopust'' translates literally from old Czech to mean "meat fast" and the festival often includes a pork feast. The tradition is most common in [[Moravia]] but also occurs in [[Bohemia]]. While practices vary, masks and costumes are present everywhere.  ====Denmark and Norway==== {{main|Fastelavn}} Carnival in Denmark is called ''Fastelavn'', and is held on the Sunday or Monday before Ash Wednesday. The holiday is sometimes described as a Nordic [[Halloween]], with children dressing in costume and gathering treats for the ''Fastelavn'' feast. One popular custom is the ''fastelavnsris'', a [[switch (corporal punishment)|switch]] that children use to [[flagellation|flog]] their parents to wake them up on Fastelavns Sunday.  In Norway, students having seen celebrations in [[:fr:Bals du Carnival de Paris|Paris]] introduced Carnival processions, masked balls and Carnival balls to Christiana in the 1840s and 1850s. From 1863, the artist federation kunstnerforeningen held annual Carnival balls in the old [[Freemasons]] lodge, which inspired [[Johan Svendsen]]s compositions "Norsk Kunstnerkarneval" and "Karneval in Paris". The following year, Svendsens Festpolonaise was written for the opening procession. [[Edvard Grieg]] attended and wrote "aus dem Karneval" (folkelivsbilleder Op. 19). Since 1988, the student organization [[:no:Tårnseilerne|Tårnseilerne]] has produced annual masquerade balls in Oslo, with masks, costumes and processions after attending an opera performance. The Carnival season also includes Fastelavens søndag (with cream buns) and fastelavensris with decorated branches.  ====England==== {{Main|Shrove Tuesday}} In England, the season immediately before Lent was called Shrovetide. A time for [[Confession (religion)|confessing sins]] (''shriving''), it had fewer festivities than the Continental Carnivals. Today, [[Shrove Tuesday]] is celebrated as [[Pancake Day]], but little else of the Lent-related Shrovetide survived the 16th-century [[English Reformation]]. Possibly the only Shrovetide Carnival in the United Kingdom is celebrated in [[Cowes]] and [[East Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].  ====France==== Some major Carnivals of mainland France are the [[Nice Carnival]], the Dunkirk Carnival and the Limoux Carnival. The [[Nice]] Carnival was held as far back as 1294, and annually attracts over a million visitors during the two weeks preceding Lent.  Since 1604 a characteristic [[Carnival of Limoux|masked Carnival]] is celebrated in [[Limoux]].  The [[Dunkirk]] Carnival is among the greatest and most exuberant carnivals celebrated in Europe. Its traditions date back to the 17th century and are based on the 'vischerbende' as fishermen went from one café to another accompanied by their relatives and friends just before departing to Icelandic fishing grounds.  In [[French West Indies]], it occurs between the Sunday of Epiphany and Ash Wednesday;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guadeloupe-guide.net/guadeloupe-evenements-us.php|title=Guadeloupe Guide - Events in Guadeloupe - French West Indies|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref> this dates back to the arrival of French colonists in the islands.  ====Germany, Switzerland, and Austria==== {{main|Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|l1=Karneval in Germany and Austria|Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht|l2=Fastnacht or Fasnacht in Germany, Switzerland, Alsace and Austria}}  =====Germany===== The Karneval, Fasching, or Fastnacht season in the German-speaking world officially begins on 11/11 of any given year at 11:11 AM and ends just before midnight on Ash Wednesday the following year after the Monday's ''Rosenmontag Parade''.

This time is also called the "Fifth Season". Shrove Tuesday is celebrated in some cities, but Germany has no special name for that day.  Parties feature self-made and more fanciful costumes and occasional masks. The parties become more exuberant as the weeks progress and peak after New Year, in January and February. The final Tuesday features all-night parties, dancing, hugging and kissing. Some parties are for all, some for women only and some for children. [[Kreppel]], or donuts, are the traditional Fasching food and are baked or fried.  In Germany, the ''Rheinische Fasching'' and the ''Schwäbische Fastnacht ''are distinct.  ====="Rheinische" Carnival (Fasching)===== The "Rheinische" Carnival is held in the west of Germany, mainly in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia or Nordrhein-Westfalen, Rhineland Palatinate or Rheinland-Pfalz, but also in Hessen [including Oberhessen], Bavaria and other states. Some cities are more famous for celebrations such as parades and costume balls. Köln or [[Cologne Carnival]], as well as Mainz and Düsseldorf are the largest and most famous. Other cities have their own, often less well-known celebrations, parades and parties such as Worms am Rhein, Speyer, Kaiserslautern, Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen, Stuttgart, Augsburg and München [Munich] Nürnberg. On Carnival Thursday (called "Old Women Day" or "The Women's Day") in commemoration of an 1824 revolt by washer-women, women storm city halls, cut men's ties, and are allowed to kiss any passing man.  [[File:VSAN TT 2014 Sa17.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Reitenderle, der Grundholde, Hudelmale, Schnarragagges; popular Fasnet characters from [[Kisslegg]] im Allgäu, [[Swabia]].]] The Fasching parades and floats make fun of individual politicians and other public figures. Many speeches do the same.  ====="Swabian-Alemannic" Carnival (''Schwäbische Fastnacht'')===== The "Swabian-Alemannic" Carnival, known as ''Schwäbische Fastnacht'', takes place in Baden and Schwaben ([[Swabia]], Southwestern Germany), the [[Allgäu]], Elsass (i.e. [[Alsace]]) and [[Vorarlberg]] (Western Austria). During the pagan era it represented the time of year when the reign of the grim winter spirits is over and these spirits are hunted and expelled.  It then adapted to Catholicism. The first official record of "Karneval, Fasching or Fastnacht" in Germany dates to 1296.  =====Swiss Fasnacht===== [[File:Monstercorso 2009.JPG|thumb|right|200px|From the ''Monstercorso'' on [[Fat Tuesday|''Güdisdienstag's'']] evening in [[Lucerne]] (2009)]] In Switzerland ''Fasnacht'' takes place in the Catholic [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of Switzerland, e.g. in [[Lucerne#events|Lucerne]] (''Lozärner Fasnacht''), but also in Protestant [[Carnival of Basel|Basel]]. However the ''Basler Fasnacht'' begins on the Monday ''after'' Ash Wednesday. Both began in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Smaller Fasnacht festivities take place across German Switzerland, e.g. in [[Bernese Fassnacht (Carnival)|Bern]], [[Olten]], or in the eastern part (Zurich, St. Gallen, Appenzell).  ====Greece==== [[File:Kingcarnival.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The float of the King Carnival parading in Patras, Greece]] In Greece Carnival is also known as the ''Apokriés'' (Greek: Αποκριές, "saying goodbye to meat"), or the season of the "Opening of the [[Triodion]]", so named after the liturgical book used by the church from then until [[Holy Week]]. One of the season's high points is [[Tsiknopempti]], when celebrants enjoy [[roast beef]] dinners; the ritual is repeated the following Sunday. The following week, the last before Lent, is called ''Tyrinē'' (Greek: Τυρινή, "cheese [week]") because meat is forbidden, although dairy products are not. Lent begins on "[[Clean Monday]]", the day after "Cheese Sunday". Throughout the Carnival season, people disguise themselves as ''maskarádes'' ("masqueraders") and engage in pranks and revelry.  [[Patras]] holds the largest annual Carnival in Greece; the famous [[Patras Carnival]] is a three-day spectacle replete with concerts, ''[[Masquerade ball|balles masqués]]'', parading troupes, a [[treasure hunt]] and many events for children. The grand parade of masked troupes and floats is held at noon on ''Tyrine'' Sunday, and culminates in the ceremonial burning of the effigy of King Carnival at the Patras harbour.  Other regions host festivities of smaller extent, focused on the reenactment of traditional carnevalic customs, such as [[Tyrnavos]] ([[Thessaly]]), [[Kozani]] ([[West Macedonia]]), [[Rethymno]] ([[Crete]]) and in [[Xanthi]] ([[East Macedonia and Thrace]]). [[Tyrnavos]] holds an annual Phallus festival, a traditional "phallkloric" event<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,553070,00.html ''The Annual Phallus Festival in Greece''], ''Der Spiegel'', English edition, 3 June 2008, Retrieved on 15 December 2008</ref> in which giant, gaudily painted effigies of [[phallus]]es made of [[papier maché]] are paraded, and which women are asked to touch or kiss. Their reward for so doing is a shot of the famous local [[tsipouro]] alcohol spirit. Every year, from 1 to 8 January, mostly in regions of Western Macedonia, Carnival fiestas and festivals erupt. The best known is the Kastorian Carnival or "Ragoutsaria" (Gr. ''"Ραγκουτσάρια"'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanea.gr/default.asp?pid=28&ct=18&artid=4548248&enthDate=27112009 |title=TA NEA On-line – Τριήμερο γλεντιού στα Ραγκουτσάρια |publisher=Tanea.gr |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref> [tags: Kastoria, Kastorian Carnival, Ragoutsaria, Ραγκουτσαρια, Καστοριά]. It takes place from 6 to 8 January with mass participation serenaded by brass bands, pipises, Macedonian and grand casa drums. It is an ancient celebration of nature's rebirth (fiestas for Dionysus (Dionysia) and Kronos (Saturnalia)), which ends the third day in a dance in the medieval square Ntoltso where the bands play at the same time.  ====Hungary==== [[File:Busójárás (Mohács), 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Busójárás]] in Hungary]] In [[Mohács]], Hungary, the [[Busójárás]] is a celebration held at the end of the Carnival season. It involves locals dressing in woolly costumes, with scary masks and noise-makers. They perform a burial ritual to symbolise the end of winter and spike [[doughnuts]] on weapons to symbolise the defeat of [[Ottomans]].  ====Italy==== {{main|Carnival in Italy}} [[File:Venice Carnival (2010).jpg|thumb|200px|This Venetian tradition is most famous for its [[Venetian mask|distinctive masks]]]]  [[File:Borghetto Battle of Oranges - Battaglia delle Arance 2007 - Ivrea.jpg|thumbnail|200px|The ''[[Battle of the Oranges]]'' at carnival of [[Ivrea]]]] The most famous Carnivals of Italy are held in [[Venice]], [[Viareggio]] and [[Ivrea]].  The [[Carnival of Venice|Carnival in Venice]] was first recorded in 1268. Its subversive nature is reflected in Italy's many laws over the centuries attempting to restrict celebrations and the wearing of [[mask]]s. Carnival celebrations in Venice were halted after the city fell under Austrian control in 1798, but were revived in the late 20th century.  The month-long [[Carnival of Viareggio]] is characterized mainly by its parade of floats and masks [[caricature|caricaturing]] popular figures. In 2001, the town built a new "Carnival citadel" dedicated to Carnival preparations and entertainment.  The Carnival of [[Ivrea]] is famous for its ''[[Battle of the Oranges]]'' fought with fruit between the people on foot and the troops of the tyrant on carts, to remember the wars of the Middle Ages.  In the most part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Archdiocese]] of [[Milan]], the Carnival lasts four more days, ending on the Saturday after Ash Wednesday, because of the [[Ambrosian rite]].  ====Lithuania==== {{main|Užgavėnės}} Užgavėnės is a Lithuanian festival that takes place on Ash Wednesday. Its name in English means "the time before Lent". The celebration corresponds to Carnival holiday traditions.  Užgavėnės begins on the night before Ash Wednesday, when an [[effigy]] of winter (usually named Morė) is burnt. A major element symbolizes the defeat of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a staged battle between Lašininis ("porky") personifying winter and Kanapinis ("hempen man") personifying spring. Devils, witches, goats, the grim reaper and other joyful and frightening characters appear in costumes during the celebrations.  Eating pancakes is an important part of the celebration.  ====Luxembourg==== In [[Luxembourg]], the pre-Lenten holiday season is known as ''Fuesend''. Throughout the Grand-Duchy, parades and parties are held.  [[Pétange]] is the home of the Grand-Duchy's largest pre-Lenten Karneval celebration. Annually hosting a calvalcade with roughly 1200 participants and thousand of celebrants, the official name is Karneval Gemeng Péiteng or Kagepe (the initials in [[Luxembourgish]] are pronounced Ka, Ge and Pe).  The town of [[Remich]] holds a three-day-long celebration, notable for two special events in addition to its parades. The first is the Stréimännchen, which is the burning of a male effigy from the Remich Bridge that crosses the [[Moselle River]] separating the Grand Duchy from [[Germany]]. The Stréimännchen symbolizes the burning away of winter. The other special event at the Remich Fuesend celebrations is the Buergbrennen or [[bonfire]] that closes the celebration.  Like Remich, the town of [[Esch-sur-Alzette]] holds a three-day celebration. Other major Fuesend parades in Luxembourg are held in the towns of [[Diekirch]] and [[Differdange]].  ====Malta==== [[File:Carnival in Valletta - Trucks in Street of Valletta.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Carnival procession in Valletta on Malta]]  {{Main|Maltese Carnival}} Carnival in Malta (Maltese: ''il-Karnival ta' Malta'') was introduced to the islands by [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Piero de Ponte]] in 1535. It is held during the week leading up to Ash Wednesday, and typically includes masked balls, fancy dress and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical [[float (parade)|floats]] presided over by King Carnival (Maltese: ''ir-Re tal-Karnival''), marching bands and costumed revellers.  The largest celebration takes place in and around the capital city of [[Valletta]] and [[Floriana]]; several more "spontaneous" Carnivals take place in more remote areas. The [[Nadur Carnival]] is notable for its darker themes. In 2005, the Nadur Carnival hosted the largest-ever gathering of international Carnival organizers for the [[Federation of European Carnival Cities|FECC]]'s global summit.  Traditional dances include the ''parata'', a lighthearted re-enactment of the 1565 victory of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights]] over the [[Saracens|Turks]], and an 18th-century court dance known as ''il-Maltija''. Carnival food includes ''perlini'' (multi-coloured, sugar-coated almonds) and the ''prinjolata'', which is a towering assembly of sponge cake, biscuits, almonds and citrus fruits, topped with cream and pine nuts.  ====Netherlands==== {{Main|Carnival in the Netherlands}} [[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 066.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[The Fight Between Carnival and Lent]]'', [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] 1559, [[Den Bosch]]]] [[Carnival in the Netherlands]] is called ''Carnaval'', ''Vastenavond'' or ''Vastelaovend(j)'', and is most celebrated in traditionally Catholic regions, mainly the southern provinces [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. Dutch Carnaval is officially celebrated on the Sunday through Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday. Although traditions vary from town to town, some common characteristics of Dutch Carnaval include a parade, a "prince" plus cortège ("[[Jester]]/adjutant and Council of 11"), a [[Wedding#Peasant Wedding|Peasant Wedding]] (''boerenbruiloft''), and eating herring (''haring happen'') on Ash Wednesday.  Two main variants can be distinguished: the ''[[Rhineland]] Carnaval'' (locally: ''Vastelaovend'') found in the province of Limburg, and the ''[[Burgundian Netherlands|Bourgondische]] Carnaval'' (locally: ''Karneval'') found mainly in [[North Brabant]]. [[Maastricht]], Limburg's capital, holds a street Carnaval that features elaborate costumes resembling [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] influences.  The first known documentation dates from the late 8th century ([[Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum]]), but Carnaval was already mentioned during the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 and by [[Caesarius of Arles]] (470-542) around 500 CE. In the Netherlands itself the first documentation is found in 1383 in [[Den Bosch]], the oldest-known images of Dutch Carnaval festivities date from 1485, also in [['s-Hertogenbosch]].  Normal daily life comes to a stop for about a week in the southern part of the Netherlands during the carnival, with roads temporary blocked and many local businesses closed for the week as a result of employees who are en masse taking the days off during and the day after the carnival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fenvlaanderen.be/carnaval/wat-carnaval|title=Wat is carnaval? - Fen Vlaanderen|work=fenvlaanderen.be}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.ziggo.nl/leowethly/Carnaval/geschiedenis.htm|title=Geschiedenis van het carnavalsfeest|work=ziggo.nl}}</ref>  ====Poland==== The Polish Carnival Season includes [[Fat Thursday]] (Polish: ''Tłusty Czwartek''), when ''[[pączki]]'' ([[doughnuts]]) are eaten, and ''Śledzik'' ([[Shrove Tuesday]]) or Herring Day. The Tuesday before the start of Lent is also often called ''Ostatki'' (literally "leftovers"), meaning the last day to party before the Lenten season.  The traditional way to celebrate Carnival is the ''[[kulig]]'', a horse-drawn sleigh ride through the snow-covered countryside. In modern times, Carnival is increasingly seen as an excuse for intensive partying and has become more commercialized with stores offering Carnival-season sales.  ====Portugal==== [[File:Carnaval de Sesimbra 2007 24.JPG|thumb|right|Sesimbra Carnival, Portugal]] Carnival in Portugal is celebrated throughout the country, most famously in [[Ovar]], [[Sesimbra]], [[Madeira]], [[Loulé]], [[Nazaré (Portugal)|Nazaré]], and [[Torres Vedras]]. The Carnivals in [[Podence (Macedo de Cavaleiros)|Podence]] and [[Lazarim]] incorporate pagan traditions such as the [[careto]], while the Torres Vedras celebration is probably the most typical.  Although Portugal introduced Christianity and the customs related to Catholic practice to Brazil, the country has begun to adopt some aspects of Brazilian-style Carnival celebrations, in particular those of Rio de Janeiro with sumptuous parades, samba and other musical elements.  ===== Lazarim ===== [[File:Carnaval_de_Lazarim_02.jpg|thumb|Carnival at Lazarim]] In [[Lazarim]], a civil parish in the municipality of [[Lamego]], celebrations follow the pagan tradition of Roman Saturnalias. It celebrates by burning colorful effigies and dressing in home-made costumes. Locally-made wooden masks are worn. The masks are effigies of men and women with horns, but both roles are performed by men. They are distinguished by their clothes, which caricature attributes of both men and women.  The Lazarim Carnival cycle encompasses two periods, the first starting on the fifth Sunday before Fat Sunday. Masked figures and people wearing large sculpted heads walk through the town. The locals feast on meats, above all pork. The second cycle, held on Sundays preceding Ash Wednesday, incorporates the tradition of the Compadres and Comadres, with men and women displaying light-hearted authority over the other.  Over the five weeks, men prepare large masked heads and women raise funds to pay for two [[mannequins]] that will be sacrificed in a public bonfire. This is a key event and is unique to Portugal. During the bonfire, a girl reads the Compadre's will and a boy reads the Comadre's will. The executors of the will are named, a [[donkey]] is symbolically distributed to both female and male "heirs", and then the final reckoning in which the Entrudo, or Carnival doll, is burned.  =====Azores===== On the islands of the Azores local clubs and Carnival groups create colorful and creative costumes that jab at politics or culture.  On [[São Miguel Island]], Carnival features street vendors selling fried dough, called a [[Malassada]]. The festival on the biggest island starts off with a [[black tie]] grand ball, followed by Latin music at Coliseu Micaelense. A children's parade fills the streets of Ponta Delgada with children from each school district in costume. A massive parade continues past midnight, ending in [[fireworks]].  The event includes theatre performances and dances. In the "Danças de Entrudo" hundreds of people follow the dancers around the island. Throughout the show the dancers, act out scenes from daily life. The "Dances de Carnival" are [[allegorical]] and comedic tales acted out in the streets. The largest is in "[[Angra do Heroísmo]]", with more than 30 groups performing. More Portuguese-language theatrical performances occur there than anywhere else.  Festivities end on Ash Wednesday, when locals sit down for the "Batatada" or potato feast, in which the main dish is salted cod with potatoes, eggs, mint, bread and wine. Residents then return to the streets for the burning of the "Carnival clown", ending the season.  =====Madeira===== [[File:Carnival in Funchal.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A dancer in the [[Carnival of Madeira]], on the island's capital [[Funchal]]]] {{Main|Carnival of Madeira}}  On the Island of [[Madeira]], [[Funchal]], the island's capital, wakes up on the Friday before Ash Wednesday to the sound of brass bands and Carnival parades throughout downtown. Festivities continue with concerts and shows in the Praça do Município for five consecutive days. The main Carnival street parade takes place on Saturday evening with thousands of samba dancers filling the streets. The traditional street event takes place on Tuesday, featuring daring caricatures.  Arguably, Brazil's Carnival could be traced to the period of the [[Age of Discovery#Portuguese exploration|Portuguese Age of Discoveries]] when their [[caravels]] passed regularly through Madeira, a territory that emphatically celebrated Carnival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?id_news=759044|title=Carnaval da Madeira poderá ter influenciado festividades no Brasil|work=sapo.pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/cultura/2015-02-08-Historiador-diz-que-Carnaval-da-Madeira-pode-ter-influenciado-festividades-no-Brasil-|title=SIC Notícias - Cultura|work=SIC Notícias}}</ref>  ===== Other regions ===== In Estarreja, in the Central region of Portugal, the town's first references to Carnival were in the 14th century, with "Flower Battles", richly decorated floats that paraded through the streets. At the beginning of the twentieth century, these festivities ended with the deaths of its main promoters only to reappear again in the 1960s to become one of many important Carnival festivals in Portugal.  In the Northern region of Podence, children appear from Sunday to Tuesday with tin masks and colorful multilayered costumes made from red, green and yellow wool. In the Central Portugal towns of Nelas and Canas de Senhorim, Carnival is an important tourist event. Nelas and Canas de Senhorim host four festive parades that offer colorful and creative costumes: Bairro da Igreja and Cimo do Povo in Nelas and do Paço and do Rossio in Canas de Senhorim. [[File:Ovar Portugal Carnival.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ovar]] Carnival, Portugal]] Carnival in the town [[Ovar]] near Porto began in 1952, it is the region's largest festivity. It is known for its creative designs, displayed in the Carnival Parade. Its Carnival parade features troupes with themed costumes and music, ranging from the traditional to pop culture.  In Lisbon, Carnival offers parades, dances and festivities featuring stars from Portugal and Brazil. The Loures Carnival celebrates the country's folk traditions, including the "enterro do bacalhau" or burial of the [[cod]], which marks the end of Carnival and the festivities.  North of Lisbon is the famous Torres Vedras Carnival, described as the "most Portuguese in Portugal." The celebration highlight is a parade of creatively decorated streetcars that satirize society and politics.  Other Central Portugal towns, such as Fatima and Leiria, offer colorful, family-friendly celebrations. In these towns everyone dresses up as if it were [[Halloween]]. Children and adults wear masks.  In the [[Algarve]] region, several resort towns offer Carnival parades. Besides the themed floats and cars, the festivities include "samba" groups, bands, dances and music.  ====Republic of Macedonia==== The most popular Carnivals are in [[Vevčani]] and [[Strumica]].  [[The Vevčani Carnival]] ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Вевчански Kарневал, translated ''Vevchanski Karneval'') has been held for over 1,400 years, and takes place on 13 and 14 January (New Year's Eve and New Year's Day by the old calendar). The village becomes a live theatre where costumed actors improvise on the streets in roles such as the traditional "August the Stupid."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=403 |title=Vevcani Carnival |publisher=Macedonia.co.uk |accessdate=12 February 2011}}</ref>  The Strumica Carnival ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Струмички Карневал, translated ''Strumichki Karneval'') has been held since at least 1670, when the Turkish author Evlija Chelebija wrote while staying there, "I came into a town located in the foothills of a high hillock and what I saw that night was masked people running house–to–house, with laughter, scream and song." The Carnival took an organized form in 1991; in 1994, Strumica became a member of [[Federation of European Carnival Cities|FECC]] and in 1998 hosted the XVIII International Congress of Carnival Cities. The Strumica Carnival opens on a Saturday night at a masked ball where the Prince and Princess are chosen; the main Carnival night is on Tuesday, when masked participants (including groups from abroad) compete in various subjects. As of 2000, the Festival of Caricatures and Aphorisms has been held as part of Strumica's Carnival celebrations.  ====Russia==== {{Main|Maslenitsa}} [[File:Shrovetide. Kustodiev.jpg|thumb|left|Boris Kustodiev's painting of Maslenitsa]] [[Maslenitsa]] ({{lang|ru|''Масленица''}}, also called ''Pancake Week'' or "Cheese Week") is a Russian folk holiday that incorporates some pagan traditions. It is celebrated during the last week before Lent. The essential element is [[bliny]], Russian pancakes, popularly taken to symbolize the sun. Round and golden, they are made from the rich foods allowed that week by the Orthodox traditions: butter, eggs, and milk (in the tradition of Orthodox lent, the consumption of meat ceases one week before that of milk and eggs).  Maslenitsa also includes [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]]s, snowball fights, sledding, swinging on swings and sleigh rides. The mascot is a brightly dressed straw effigy of ''Lady Maslenitsa'', formerly known as [[kostroma (tradition)|Kostroma]]. The celebration culminates on Sunday evening, when ''Lady Maslenitsa'' is stripped of her finery and put to the flames of a [[bonfire]].  ====Slovakia==== In Slovakia, the [[Fašiangy]] (''fašiang'', ''fašangy'') takes place from [[Three Kings Day]] (''Traja králi'') until the midnight before Ash Wednesday (''Škaredá streda'' or ''Popolcová streda''). At the midnight marking the end of fašiangy, a symbolic burial ceremony for the [[contrabass]] is performed, because music ceases for [[Lent]].  ====Slovenia==== The Slovenian countryside displays a variety of disguised groups and individual characters among which the most popular and characteristic is the Kurent (plural: ''Kurenti''), a monstrous and demon-like, but fluffy figure. The most significant festival is held in [[Ptuj]] (see: [[Kurentovanje]]). Its special feature are the Kurents themselves, magical creatures from another world, who visit major events throughout the country, trying to banish the winter and announce spring's arrival, fertility, and new life with noise and dancing. The origin of the Kurent is a mystery, and not much is known of the times, beliefs, or purposes connected with its first appearance. The origin of the name itself is obscure.  The [[Cerknica]] Carnival is heralded by a figure called "Poganjič" carrying a whip. In the procession, organised by the "Pust society", a monstrous witch named Uršula is driven from Mt. Slivnica, to be burned at the stake on Ash Wednesday. Unique to this region is a group of [[dormice]], driven by the Devil and a huge fire-breathing dragon. [[Cerkno]] and its surrounding area are known for the ''Laufarji'', Carnival figures with artistically carved wooden masks.  The ''Maškare'' from [[Dobrepolje]] used to represent a triple character: the beautiful, the ugly (among which the most important represented by an old man, an old woman, a hunchback, and a ''Kurent'') and the noble (imitating the urban elite).  The major part of the population, especially the young and children, dress up in ordinary non-ethnic costumes, going to school, work and organized events, where prizes are given for the best and most original costumes. Costumed children sometimes go from house to house asking for treats.  ====Spain==== [[File:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes 005.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''[[The Burial of the Sardine]]'', Francisco Goya, c. 1812]] Arguably the most famous Carnivals in Spain are [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz]], [[Las Palmas]], [[Sitges]], [[Vilanova i la Geltrú]], [[Tarragona]], [[Águilas]], [[Solsona, Lleida|Solsona]], [[Cádiz]], [[Badajoz]], [[Bielsa]] (an ancestral Carnival celebration), [[Plan]], [[San Juan de Plan]], [[Laza, Spain|Laza]], Verín, Viana and [[Xinzo de Limia]].  =====Andalusia===== {{Main|Carnival of Cádiz}} [[File:Carnavaldecadiz.jpg|thumb|right|A choir singing in the Carnival of [[Cádiz]]]]  In [[Cádiz]] the costumes worn are often related to recent news, such as the [[H5N1|bird flu]] epidemic in 2006, during which many people were disguised as chickens. The feeling of this Carnival is the sharp criticism, the funny play on words and the imagination in the costumes, more than the glamorous dressings. It is traditional to paint the face with lipstick as a humble substitute of a mask.  The most famous groups are the [[chirigota]]s, choirs and [[comparsa]]s. The chirigotas are well known witty, satiric popular groups who sing about politics, new times and household topics, wearing the same costume, which they prepare for the whole year. The Choirs (''coros'') are wider groups that go on open carts through the streets singing with an orchestra of guitars and lutes. Their signature piece is the "Carnival Tango", alternating comical and serious repertory. The comparsas are the serious counterpart of the chirigota in Cádiz, and the poetic lyrics and the criticism are their main ingredients. They have a more elaborated [[polyphony]] that is easily recognizable by the typical [[countertenor]] voice.  =====Canary Islands===== {{See also|Carnival of Las Palmas|Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife}}[[File:Contestant Angeles Hernández Paez performs during the Tenerife Carnival Queen 2009 contest in Santa Cruz de Tenerife.jpg|thumb|Carnival Queen of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] 2009]]  The [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz]] Carnival is, with the Carnival of Cadiz, the most important festival for Spanish tourism and Spain's largest Carnival.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jorge |url=http://fiestas.edreams.es/Carnival/el-Carnival-de-tenerife/ |title=Fiestas de España.

Water color painting by Brad Erickson.]] In Catalonia people dress in masks and costume (often in themed groups) and organize a week-long series of parties, pranks, outlandish activities such as bed races, street dramas satirizing public figures and raucous processions to welcome the arrival of Sa Majestat el Rei Carnestoltes (His Majesty King Carnival), known by various titles, including ''el Rei dels poca-soltes'' (King of the Crackpots), ''Princep etern de Cornudella'' (Eternal Prince of Cuckoldry), ''Duc de ximples i corrumputs'' (Duke of Fools and the Corrupt), ''Marquès de la bona mamella'' (Marquis of the lovely breast), ''Comte de tots els barruts'' (Count of the Insolent), ''Baró de les Calaverades'' (Baron of Nocturnal Debaucheries), and ''Senyor de l'alt Plàtan florit, dels barraquers i gamberrades i artista d'honor dalt del llit'' (Lord of the Tall Banana in Bloom, of the Voyeurs and Punks and the Artist of Honor upon the Bed).<ref>Erickson, Brad. 2008.

Festivities are held in the open air, beginning with a ''cercavila'', a ritual procession throughout the town to call everyone to attend. ''Rues'' of masked revelers dance alongside. On Thursday ''Dijous Gras'' (Fat Thursday) is celebrated, also called 'omelette day' (el ''dia de la truita''), ''[[coca (pastry)|coques]]'' (''de llardons, butifarra d'ou, butifarra'') and [[omelettes]] are eaten. The festivities end on Ash Wednesday with elaborate funeral rituals marking the death of King Carnival, who is typically burned on a [[pyre]] in what is called the burial of the [[sardine]] (''enterrament de la sardina''), or, in Vilanova, as  ''l'enterro''.<ref name="Erickson, Brad 2008">Erickson, Brad. 2008.

The women protect their faces with ''Mantons de Manila'' (Manila shawls) but eye-patches and slings for broken arms are common the following week. Vilanovins organize an elaborate ritual for the arrival of King Carnival called ''l'Arrivo'' that changes every year. It includes a raucous procession of floats and dancers lampooning current events or public figures and a bitingly satiric sermon (''el sermo'') delivered by the King himself. On ''Dijous Gras,'' Vilanovin children are excused from school to participate in the ''Merengada,'' a day-long scene of eating and fighting with sticky, sweet meringue.

In the funeral house, the body of the King is surrounded by an honor guard and weeping concubines, crying over the loss of sexual pleasure brought about by his death. The King's body is carried to the ''Plaça de la Vila'' where a satiric eulogy is delivered while the townspeople eat salty grilled sardines with bread and wine, suggesting the symbolic [[cannibalism]] of the communion ritual. Finally, amid rockets and explosions, the King's body is burned in a massive pyre.<ref name="Erickson, Brad 2008"/><ref name="Garcia, Xavier 1972"/>  [[File:PloranyeresambSMRC.jpg|thumb|"Ploranyeres" weep for the death of His Majesty and the loss of pleasure.]]  [[File:Rucs de Solsona.jpg|thumb|right|Donkeys of Solsona, hung in the tower bell.]] Carnaval de Solsona takes place in [[Solsona, Lleida]]. It is one of the longest; free events in the streets, and nightly concerts run for more than a week. The Carnival is known for a legend that explains how a donkey was hung at the tower bell − because the animal wanted to eat grass that grew on the top of the tower. To celebrate this legend, locals hang a stuffed donkey at the tower that "pisses" above the excited crowd using a water pump. This event is the most important and takes place on Saturday night. For this reason, the inhabitants are called "matarrucs" ("donkey killers").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onsortir.cat/contents/1027/so/612.jpg|title=OnSortir|work=onsortir.cat}}</ref>  Another characteristic of the Carnival is its giants.

These groups of friends create and personalize a uniformed suit to wear during the festivities  In [[Sitges]] special feasts include ''xatonades'' (''[[xató]]'' is a traditional local salad of the Penedès coast) served with omelettes. Two important moments are the ''Rua de la Disbauxa'' (Debauchery Parade) on Sunday night and the ''Rua de l'Extermini'' (Extermination Parade) on Tuesday night. Around 40 floats draw more than 2,500 participants.  [[Tarragona]] has one of the region's most complete ritual sequences. The events start with the building of a huge barrel and ends with its burning with the effigies of the King and Queen. On Saturday, the main parade takes place with masked groups, zoomorphic figures, music and percussion bands, and groups with [[fireworks]] (the devils, the dragon, the ox, the female dragon). Carnival groups stand out for their clothes full of elegance, showing brilliant examples of fabric crafts, at the Saturday and Sunday parades. About 5,000 people are members of the parade groups.  ===North America===  ====Caribbean==== {{Main|Caribbean Carnival}} Most [[Caribbean]] islands celebrate Carnival. The largest and most well-known is in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The [[Dominican Republic]], [[Guyana]], [[Antigua]], [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Cuba]], [[Curaçao]], [[Barbados]], [[Dominica]], [[Haiti]], [[Grenada]], Guadeloupe, [[Jamaica]], [[Saba]], [[Sint Eustatius]] (Statia), [[Sint Maarten]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Kitts]], [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] and the [[Grenadines]] hold lengthy carnival seasons and large celebrations.  Carnival is an important cultural event in the [[Dutch Antilles]]. Festivities include "jump-up" parades with beautifully colored costumes, floats, and live bands as well as [[beauty contests]] and other competitions. Celebrations include a middle-of-the-night [[j'ouvert]] (juvé) parade that ends at sunrise with the burning of a straw King Momo, cleansing sins and bad luck. On Statia he is called Prince Stupid.  Carnival has been celebrated in Cuba since the 18th century. Participants don costumes from the island's cultural and ethnic variety. After [[Fidel Castro|Fidel Castro's]] [[Cuban Revolution|Communist Revolution]], Carnival's religious overtones were suppressed. The events remained, albeit frowned upon by the state. Carnival celebrations have been in decline throughout Cuba since then.  =====Aruba===== Carnival means weeks of events that bring colourfully decorated floats, contagiously throbbing music, luxuriously costumed groups of celebrants of all ages, King and Queen elections, electrifying jump-ups and torchlight parades, the Jouvert morning: the Children's Parades and finally the Grand Parade. Aruba's biggest celebration is a month-long affair consisting of festive "jump-ups" (street parades), spectacular parades and creative contests. Music and flamboyant costumes play a central role, from the Queen elections to the Grand Parade. Street parades continue in various districts throughout the month, with brass band, [[steel drum]] and [[roadmarch]] tunes. On the evening before Lent, Carnival ends with the symbolic burning of King Momo.  =====Antigua===== {{Main|Antigua Carnival}} The Antiguan Carnival is held from the end of July to the first Tuesday in August. The most important day is that of the j'ouvert (or juvé), in which brass and steel drum bands perform. Barbuda's Carnival, held in June, is known as Caribana. The Antiguan and Barbudan Carnivals replaced the Old Time Christmas Festival in 1957, with hopes of inspiring tourism.  =====Barbados===== {{Main|Crop over}} Carnival is known as Crop Over and is Barbados's biggest festival. Its early beginnings were on the [[sugar cane]] [[plantations]] during the colonial period. Crop over began in 1688, and featured singing, dancing and accompaniment by [[shak-shak]], [[banjo]], [[triangle]], [[fiddle]], guitar, bottles filled with water and bones. Other traditions included climbing a greased pole, feasting and drinking competitions. Originally signaling the end of the yearly cane harvest, it evolved into a national festival. In the late 20th century, Crop Over began to closely mirror the Trinidad Carnival. Beginning in June, Crop Over runs until the first Monday in August when it culminates in the finale, The Grand Kadooment.  Carnival time for many islanders is one big party. Craft markets, food tents/stalls, street parties and cavalcades fill every week.  A major feature is the [[calypso music|calypso]] competition. Calypso music, originating in Trinidad, uses syncopated rhythm and topical lyrics. It offers a medium in which to satirise local politics, amidst the general bacchanal. Calypso tents, also originating in Trinidad, feature cadres of musicians who perform biting social commentaries, political exposés or rousing exhortations to "wuk dah waistline" and "roll dat bumper".  The groups compete for the Calypso Monarch Award, while the air is redolent with the smells of [[Barbadian cuisine|Bajan]] cooking during the Bridgetown Market Street Fair. The Cohobblopot Festival blends dance, drama and music with the crowning of the King and Queen of costume bands. Every evening the "Pic-o-de-Crop" Show is performed after the King of Calypso is finally crowned. The climax of the festival is Kadooment Day celebrated with a national holiday when costume bands fill the streets with pulsating Barbadian rhythms and fireworks.  =====Belize===== [[San Pedro Town|San Pedro]] is one of [[Belize|Belize's]] few cities to observe Carnaval before Lent. Elsewhere Carnaval (sometimes referred to as Carnival) often occurs in September. The Fiesta de Carnaval is often the most popular celebration, usually held over three days prior to Ash Wednesday, but the festivities often extend to the full week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://belizeanminds.blogspot.ca/2013/09/history-of-carnivals-in-belize-review.html|title=Belizean Minds|work=belizeanminds.blogspot.ca}}</ref> This festival "always includes music, dancing, costumes and parades".<ref>Samuel Brown, J.; Vorhees, M. (2013). ''Belize. Lonely Planet Publishing.''</ref>  [[Comparsa]]s are held throughout the week, consisting of large groups "of dancers dancing and traveling on the streets, followed by a Carrosa (carriage) where the musicians play. The Comparsa is a development of African processions where groups of devotees follow a given saint or deity during a particular religious celebration".<ref>[[Comparsa]]</ref> One of the most popular comparsas of Fiesta de Carnaval is the male group comparsa, usually composed of notable men from the community who dress up in outlandish costumes or cross-dress and dance to compete for money and prizes.<ref name="goambergriscaye.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.goambergriscaye.com/fest.html|title=Ambergris Caye, Belize, Festivals|work=goambergriscaye.com}}</ref> Other popular activities include body painting and flour fighting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/belize/the-northern-cayes/ambergris-caye-and-san-pedro/events/local-festivals-culture/fiesta-de-carnaval|title=Fiesta de Carnaval|author=Lonely Planet|work=Lonely Planet}}</ref><ref name="joseluiszapata.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.joseluiszapata.com/2012/02/carnaval-de-san-pedro-belize/|title=Carnaval de San Pedro, Belize|work=joseluiszapata.com}}</ref> "On the last day of Carnival painters flood the street to paint each other.

Notable events leading up to Carnival include the Opening of Carnival celebrations, the Calypso Monarch music competition, the Queen of Carnival Beauty Pageant and [[bouyon music]] bands. Celebrations last for the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday.  =====Dominican Republic===== {{main|Dominican Carnival}} Dominican Carnival is celebrated in most cities and towns in the main streets during February. Among its main characteristics are its flashy costumes and loud music. The one held in [[La Vega (city)|La Vega]], which is one of the biggest in the country, and the National parade in [[Santo Domingo]] was where the first Carnival of the Americas was held.  Carvnival masks are elaborate and colorful. The costumes used on the parades are satires of the Devil and are called "Diablos Cojuelos". They dance, and run to the rhythm of [[Merengue music|Merengue]] mixed with techno, hip-hop, and [[reggaeton]]. Additional [[allegorical]] characters represent Dominican traditions such as "Roba la Gallina", and "Califé".  One of the most international parades is in [[San Pedro de Macorís]]. It exhibits the "Guloyas" parade of costumed groups dancing in the streets. Revelers flee from the "Diablos Cojuelos" who try to hit them with "Vejigas".  The timing of the festivals has grown apart from its original religious synchronization with the period of Lent. Due to National Independence Day on [[Dominican Republic#Independence|27th of February]] and the birthday of [[Juan Pablo Duarte|its founding father]] on the 26th of January, the Carnival celebrations fill February regardless of the Lenten calendar.  =====Haiti===== {{Main|Haitian Carnival}}  Carnival in [[Haiti]] started in 1804 in the capital [[Port-au-Prince]] after the [[Haitian Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]]. The Port-au-Prince Carnival is one of the largest in North America. It is known as Kanaval in the [[Creole language]]. It starts in January, known as "Pre-Kanaval", while the main carnival activities begin in February. In July 2012, Haiti had another carnival called Kanaval de Fleur. Beautiful costumes, floats, Rara parades,<ref>{{cite web|title=Rara Festivals in Haiti and its Diaspora|url=http://rara.wesleyan.edu/|publisher=Wesleyan University|accessdate=5 November 2012}}</ref> masks, foods, and popular [[rasin]] music (like Boukman Eksperyans, Foula Vodoule, Tokay, Boukan Ginen, Eritaj, etc.) and [[Compas|kompa]] bands (such as T-Vice, Djakout No. 1, [[Sweet Micky]], Kreyòl{{nbsp}}La, D.P.

Carnival finishes on Ash Wednesday, followed by [[rara]], another parading musical tradition known mainly in Haiti and in the Dominican Republic. This festival emphasises religion. Songs are composed each year and bands play bamboo tubes (vaksin) and homemade horns (konèt). Rara is also performed in Prospect and Central Parks in summertime New York.<ref>{{cite book|last=McAlister|first=Elizabeth|title=Rara!

It is a cultural import from Trinidad & Tobago. The celebration starts with the opening of mas camp launch.{{Clarify|date = March 2015}} Preliminaries are followed up with a Beach Jouvert, Bacchanal Jouvert and end with a Road March.

Tobago's celebration culminates on Monday and Tuesday on a much smaller scale in Scarborough. Carnival combines costumes, dance, music, competitions, rum and partying (fete-ing). Music styles include Soca, Calypso and [[Rapso]] and more recently [[Chutney-soca]].  The annual Carnival [[Steel Pan|steel pan]] competition known as the National Panorama competition holds the finals on the Saturday before the main event. Pan players compete in categories such as "Conventional Steel Band" or "Single Pan Band" by performing renditions of the year's calypsos.  "Dimanche Gras" takes place on the Sunday night before Ash Wednesday. Here the [[Calypso Monarch]] is chosen (after competition) and prize money and a vehicle awarded. The King and Queen of the bands are crowned, where each band parades costumes for two days and submits a king and queen, from which an overall winner is chosen. These usually involve huge, complex, beautiful well-crafted costumes, that includes 'wire-bending'.  J'ouvert, or "Dirty Mas", takes place before dawn on the Monday (known as Carnival Monday) before Ash Wednesday. It means ""opening of the day". Revelers dress in costumes embodying puns on current affairs, especially political and social events. "Clean Mud" (clay mud), oil paint and body paint are familiar during J'ouvert. A common character is "Jab-jabs" (devils, blue, black or red) complete with pitchfork, pointed horns and tails. A King and Queen of J'ouvert are chosen, based on their witty political/social messages.  [[File:Carnival Costume in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|The Carnival King costume for a particular band]] Carnival Monday involves the parade of the mas bands. Revelers wear only parts of their costumes, more for fun than display or competition. Monday Night Mas is popular in most towns and especially the capital, where smaller bands compete. There is also the "Bomb Competition" which is a smaller-scaled judging of steel bands.  Carnival Tuesday hosts the main events. Full costume is worn, complete with make-up and body paint/adornment. Usually "Mas Boots" that complement the costumes are worn. Each band has their costume presentation based on a particular theme, and contains various sections (some consisting of thousands of revelers) that reflect these themes. The street parade and band costume competition take place. The mas bands eventually converge on the Queen's Park Savannah to pass on "The Stage" for judging. The singer of the most played song is crowned Road March King or Queen earning prize money and usually a vehicle.  This parading and revelry goes on until Tuesday midnight. Ash Wednesday itself, while not an official holiday, sends flocks to local beaches. The most popular are [[Maracas Beach]] and [[Manzanilla Beach, Trinidad and Tobago|Manzanilla Beach]], where huge beach parties take place on Ash Wednesday.  ====Guatemala==== The most famous Carnival celebration in Guatemala is in [[Mazatenango]]. During February, Mazatenango is famous for its eight-day Carnival Feast. Days of food, music, parades and games fill the streets of the department of [[Suchitepéquez]]. As one Guatemalan website states, "To mention the Carnival of Mazatenango is to bring to mind moments of a happy and cordial party. In the eight days of this celebration's duration the local residents have kept alive the traditions of the Department."  ====Honduras==== In [[La Ceiba]] in Honduras, Carnival is held on the fourth Saturday of every May to commemorate [[Isidore the Laborer|San Isidro]]. It is the largest Carnival celebration in Central America.  ====Nicaragua==== On the Caribbean coast of [[Bluefields]], [[Nicaragua]], Carnival is better known as Palo de Mayo (or Mayo Ya!) and is celebrated every day of May.  In [[Managua]], it is celebrated for 2 days. There it is named ''"Alegria por la vida"'' translated to ''"Joy for Life"'' and features a different theme each year. Another festival in Managua is called " Santo Domingo de Guzman" and lasts ten days.  ====Mexico==== {{main|Carnival in Mexico}} In Mexico, Carnival is celebrated in about 225 cities and towns. The largest is in [[Mazatlán]] and the [[Veracruz, Veracruz|city of Veracruz]] with others in Baja California and Yucatán. The larger city Carnivals employ costumes, elected queens and parades with floats, but Carnival celebrations in smaller and rural areas vary widely depending on the level of European influence during Mexico's colonial period. The largest of these is in [[Huejotzingo]], [[Puebla]] where most townspeople take part in mock combat with rifles shooting blanks, roughly based on the [[Battle of Puebla]]. Other important states with local traditions include [[Morelos]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Chiapas]].  ====Panama==== Traditionally beginning on Friday and ending on the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, "los Carnavales", as Panamanians refer to the days of Carnival, are celebrated across the country. Carnival Week is especially popular because of the opulent [[Las Tablas, Los Santos|Las Tablas]] Carnival as well as the Carnival celebrations in [[Panama City]] and almost all of the [[Azuero Peninsula]]. The Panamanian Carnival is also popular because of the concerts in the most visited areas.  ====Bahamas==== In an effort to capitalize on Carnival's popularity, the [[Bahamas]] announced the first Bahamas Junkanoo Carnival to commence in May 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=//http://www.bahamas.co.uk/about/junkanoo/bahamas-junkanoo-carnival | title=Bahamas Junkanoo Carnival}}</ref>  ====Canada==== [[Caribana]], held in Toronto on the first weekend of August, has its origins in Caribbean Carnival traditions. Due to the more comfortable weather, [[Caribana]] is held in the summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caribana.com/index.html |title=The Online Guide to Toronto's Summer Carnival |publisher=Caribana.Com |date=15 August 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref> Attendance at the parade typically exceeds one million.  The [[Quebec Winter Carnival]] is the biggest winter-themed Carnival in the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} It depends on snowfall and very cold weather, to keep snowy [[ski]] trails in good condition and [[ice sculpture]]s frozen. Again, weather pushes this to the last days of January and first days of February.  In the Ottawa-Gatineau region, [[Winterlude]] takes place during the first 4 weeks of February.  ====United States==== {{main|Mardi Gras in the United States|Mardi Gras}} [[File:KdEtat07WheelOfTortureCondi.jpg|thumb|"Wheel of Torture" float, satirizing TV show "Wheel of Fortune" and US government use of torture.

It is called the [[Labor Day Carnival]], West Indian Day Parade or West Indian Day Carnival, and was founded by immigrants from Trinidad. That country has one of the largest Caribbean Carnivals. In the mid twentieth century, West Indians moved the event from the beginning of Lent to the Labor Day weekend. Carnival is one of the largest parades and street festivals in New York, with over one million attending. The parade, which consists of steel bands, floats, elaborate Carnival costumes and sound trucks, proceeds along Brooklyn's Eastern Parkway in the [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] neighborhood.  Starting in 2013, the Slovenian-American community located in the St. Clair-Superior neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio began hosting a local version of [[Kurentovanje]], the Carnival event held in the city of Ptuj, [[Carnival#Slovenia|Slovenia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clevelandkurentovanje.com/|title=Cleveland Kurentovanje|work=Cleveland Kurentovanje}}</ref> The event is conducted on the Saturday prior to Ash Wednesday.  =====Louisiana===== {{Main|New Orleans Mardi Gras}} [[File:StAnne06Marigny29.jpg|thumbnail|right|Revelers on [[Frenchmen Street]], 2006]] The most widely-known, most elaborate and most popular US events are in New Orleans, while other South Louisiana cities such as Lake Charles, [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Mamou, Louisiana|Mamou]], [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]], and [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]], all of which were under French control at one time or another, also hold Carnival celebrations.

A truck with giant speakers and a platform, where musicians play songs of local genres such as [[Axé music]], [[Samba-reggae]] and [[Arrocha]], drives through town with a crowd following while dancing and singing. It was originally staged by two Salvador musicians, Dodo & Osmar, in the 1950s. After the [[Salvador, Bahia#Carnival.2FCarnaval|Salvador Carnival]], [[Porto Seguro]] continues the celebration.  Three circuits make up the festival. Campo Grande is the longest and most traditional. Barra-Ondina is the most famous on the seaside of Barra Beach and Ondina Beach and Pelourinho.<ref>[http://www.carnaval.salvador.ba.gov.br/2013/capa/pagina.php?id=61] {{wayback|url=http://www.carnaval.salvador.ba.gov.br/2013/capa/pagina.php?id=61 |date=20130606070943 |df=y }}</ref>  International singers like [[David Guetta]], [[Will.I.Am]], [[Psy (entertainer)|Psy]] and Bob Sinclair performed in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/bahia/carnaval/2013/noticia/2013/02/psy-claudia-leitte-e-sabrina-sato-dancam-no-fim-do-circuito-dodo.html|title=G1 - Psy, Claudia Leitte e Sabrina Sato dançam juntos em Salvador - notícias em Carnaval 2013 na Bahia|work=Carnaval 2013 na Bahia}}</ref> [[Ivete Sangalo]], [[Claudia Leitte]], [[Daniela Mercury]], [[Margareth Menezes]], [[Chiclete com Banana]] and [[Banda Eva]] are some traditional attractions.

It has managed to reinterpret traditions that belonged to Colombia's African and [[Amerindian]] cultures. Documentary evidence shows that Carnival existed in Colombia in the 18th century and had already been a cause for concern for colonial authorities, who censored the celebrations, especially in the main political centres such as [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Bogotá]] and [[Popayán]].  The Carnival continued its evolution in small/unimportant towns out of view of the rulers. The result was the uninterrupted celebration of Carnival festivals in [[Barranquilla]] (see [[Barranquilla's Carnival]]) now recognized as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. The Barranquilla Carnival includes several parades on Friday and Saturday nights beginning on 11 January and ending with a six-day non-stop festival, beginning the Wednesday prior to Ash Wednesday and ending Tuesday midnight. Other celebrations occur in villages along the lower [[Magdalena River]] in northern Colombia, and in [[Pasto]], [[Nariño]] (see [[Blacks and Whites' Carnival]]) in the south of the country. In the early 20th century, attempts to introduce Carnival in Bogotá were rejected by the government. The [[Bogotá Carnival]] was renewed in the 21st century.  ====Ecuador==== [[File:Comparsa latacungueña desfilando.jpg|thumb|Party in [[Latacunga]] city]] In Ecuador, the celebrations began before the arrival of Catholicism. The Huarangas Indians (from the Chimbos nation) used to celebrate the second moon of the year with a festival at which they threw flour, flowers and perfumed water. This pagan tradition merged with the Catholic celebration of Carnival.  A common feature of Ecuadorian Carnival is the ''diablitos'' (little devils) who play with water. As with snowball fights, the practice of throwing or dumping water on unsuspecting victims is revered by children and teenagers although feared by some adults. Throwing water balloons, sometimes even eggs and flour both to friends and strangers is fun, but can also upset the uninformed.  Although the government as well as school authorities forbid such games, they are widely practiced. Historians tell of a Bishop in 1867 who threatened [[excommunication]] for the [[sin]] of playing Carnival games.  Festivals differ across the country. Locals wear disguises with colorful masks and dance. Usually, the celebrations begin with the election of ''Taita Carnival'' (Father Carnival) who heads the festivities and leads the parades in each city.  The most famed Carnival festivities are in [[Guaranda]] (Bolivar province) and [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]] (Tungurahua province). In Ambato, the festivities are called Fiesta de las Flores y las Frutas (Festival of the Flowers and Fruits). Other cities have revived Carnival traditions with colorful parades, such as in [[Azogues]] (Cañar Province). In Azogues and the Southern [[Andes]] in general, ''Taita Carnival'' is always an indigenous [[Cañari]]. Recently a celebration has gained prominence in the northern part of the Sierra in the [[Chota Valley]] in [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]] which is a zone of a strong [[Afro-Ecuadorian people|afro-Ecuadorian]] population and so the Carnival is celebrated with [[Bomba (Ecuador)|bomba del chota]] music.  [[Latacunga]] celebrates Carnival of three manners:<ref>{{cite web|title=carnival Latacunga|url=http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101464647/-1/Celebraci%C3%B3n_y_fiesta__en_La_Laguna.html#.Vj0nsdIrLcc|accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref> Carnival with water where people play with water, Religious Carnival where people make religious festivity and Carnival Parade in the city in which people march on the Latacunga streets wearing mask while they dance with music band.  ====French Guiana==== The Carnival of [[French Guiana]] has roots in [[Creole peoples|Creole]] culture. Everyone participates – mainland French, Brazilians (Guiana has a frontier with Brazil) and Chinese as well as Creoles.  Its duration is variable, determined by movable religious festivals: Carnival begins at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and ends on Ash Wednesday, and so typically lasts through most of January and February. During this period, from Friday evening until Monday morning the entire country throbs to the rhythm of masked balls and street parades.  Friday afternoons are for eating ''galette des rois'' (the cake of kings) and drinking champagne. The cake may be flavoured with [[frangipani]], [[guava]], or [[coconut]].  On Sunday afternoons major parades fill the streets of [[Cayenne]], [[Kourou]] and Saint-Laurent du Maroni. Competing groups prepare for months. Dressed to follow the year's agreed theme, they march with Carnival floats, drums and brass bands.  Brazilian groups are appreciated for their elaborate feathered and sequined costumes. However, they are not eligible for competition since the costumes do not change over time.  Mythical characters appear regularly in the parades: * ''Karolin −'' a small person dressed in a magpie tail and top hat, riding on a shrew. * ''Les Nèg'marrons'' −'' g''roups of men dressed in red loincloths, bearing ripe tomatoes in their mouths while their bodies are smeared with grease or molasses. They deliberately try to come in contact with spectators, soiling their clothes. * ''Les makoumés'' −'' ''Cross-dressing men  (out of the Carnival context, ''makoumé'' is a pejorative term for a [[homosexual]]). * ''Soussouris'' (the bat)'' −'' a character dressed in a winged [[leotard]] from head to foot, usually black in colour. Traditionally malevolent, this character is liable to chase spectators and "sting" them.  [[File:Toulou.jpg|thumb|right|Four touloulous]] A uniquely Creole tradition is the touloulous. These women wear decorative gowns, gloves, masks and headdresses that cover them completely, making them unrecognisable, even to the colour of their skin. On Friday and Saturday nights of Carnival, touloulou balls are held in so-called ''universities''; in reality, large dance halls that open only at Carnival time. Touloulous get in free, and are even given condoms in the interest of the sexual health of the community. Men attend the balls, but they pay admittance and are not disguised. The touloulous pick their dance partners, who may not refuse. The setup is designed to make it easy for a woman to create a temporary liaison with a man in total anonymity. Undisguised women are not welcomed. By tradition, if such a woman gets up to dance, the orchestra stops playing. Alcohol is served at bars – the disguised women whisper to the men "touloulou thirsty", at which a round of drinks is expected, to be drunk through a straw protect their anonymity.  In more modern times, Guyanais men have attempted to turn the tables by staging ''soirées tololo'', in which it's the men who, in disguise, seek partners from undisguised women bystanders.  The final four days of Carnival follow a rigid schedule, and no work is done: * Sunday'' −'' The Grand Parade, in which the groups compete. * Monday'' −'' Marriage burlesque, with men dressed as brides and women as grooms. * Tuesday'' −'' Red Devil Day in which everyone wears red or black. * (Ash) Wednesday'' −'' Dress is black and white only, for the grand ceremony of burning the effigy of Vaval, King Carnival.  ====Peru==== [[File:Carnaval de juliaca.jpg|thumb|200 px|Morenada dance, in the Carnival of the Juliaca city – Perú.]]  =====Cajamarca===== The town of Cajamarca is considered the capital of Carnival in [[Peru]]. Local residents of all ages dance around the ''unhsa'', or ''yunsa'', a tree adorned with ribbons, balloons, toys, fruits, bottles of liquor and other prizes.  At a certain point the ''Mayordomo'' (governor of the feast) walks into the circle. The governor chooses a partner to go to the ''unsha'', which they attempt to cut down by striking it three times with a [[machete]]. The machete is passed from couple to couple as each strikes the tree three times. When the unsha finally falls, the crowd rushes to grab the prizes.  The person who successfully brings down the unsha becomes the following year's governor.  =====Violence=====  {{confusing|section|date=September 2015}} The Peruvian Carnival consists mostly of violent games that last all February, extending to early March if Ash Wednesday falls in March, but rarely ending when it falls in February.<ref name="http://blogs.elcomercio.pe/huellasdigitales/2010/02/de-cuando-el-Carnival-era-en-t.html">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.elcomercio.pe/huellasdigitales/2010/02/de-cuando-el-Carnival-era-en-t.html |title=De cuando el Carnival duraba tres días – Huellas digitales &#124; Blogs &#124; El Comercio Perú |publisher=Blogs.elcomercio.pe |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}</ref> Quoting the [[Lima]] police chief, "The Carnival is associated with criminal actions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.24horas.com.pe/nacionales/1171893096.php |title=Panamericana – Mercedes Aráoz: Captura de José E.

Traditionally, Peruvian Andean festivities were held on this period every year because it is the rainy season. It was already violent during the 19th century,<ref>[http://www.editoraperu.com.pe/edc/02/02/08/cul4.htm] {{wayback|url=http://www.editoraperu.com.pe/edc/02/02/08/cul4.htm |date=20050110092925 |df=y }}</ref> but the government limited the practice. During the early 20th century it consisted partying and parading, while in the second half of the 20th century it acquired violent characteristics that continued. It was banned, first from the streets in 1958 and altogether in 1959 by the [[Prado]] government.<ref name="http://blogs.elcomercio.pe/huellasdigitales/2010/02/de-cuando-el-Carnival-era-en-t.html"/> It consisted basically of water battles in a traditional way,{{Clarify|date = March 2015}} while in later years it included playing with dirty water, mud, oil and colorants -and also including fighting and sometimes [[looting]] private property and [[sexual assaults]] on women. It has become an excuse for criminal gangs to rob people while pretending to celebrate. As of 2010, it had become so violent that the government imposed penalties of up to eight years in prison<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/noticia/408740/no-violencia-Carnivales-penaran-hasta-anos-carcel-quienes-causen-lesiones-graves |title=No a violencia por Carnivales: penarán hasta con 8 años de cárcel a quienes causen lesiones graves &#124; El Comercio Perú |publisher=Elcomercio.pe |accessdate=12 February 2011}}</ref> for violence during the games (the games themselves are not forbidden, but using violence during the games or coercing others to participate is).<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://peru21.pe/noticia/407870/Carnivales-cinco-mil-policias-reforzaran-seguridad-lima |title=Carnivales en Lima: unos cinco mil policías reforzarán la seguridad&#124; Perú21 |publisher=Peru21.pe |accessdate=12 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larepublica.pe/sociedad/26/01/2009/en-proximos-Carnivales-policias-vestidos-de-civiles-evitaran-violencia |title=En proximos Carnivales policias vestidos de civiles evitaran violencia |publisher=LaRepublica.pe |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.24horas.com.pe/nacionales/1170518585.php |title=Panamericana – Mercedes Aráoz: Captura de José E.

Celebrations in [[Montevideo]] are the largest. The festival is performed in the European parade style with elements from [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Angola]]n [[Benguela]] cultures imported with slaves in colonial times. The main attractions of Uruguayan Carnival include two colorful parades called ''Desfile de Carnaval'' (Carnival Parade) and ''Desfile de Llamadas'' (Calls Parade, a [[candombe]]-summoning parade).<ref>[http://www.uruguaynow.com/montevideo-Carnival.php Carnival is Coming (UruguayNow)]</ref>  During the celebration, theaters called ''tablados'' are built in many places throughout the cities, especially in Montevideo. Traditionally formed by men and now starting to be open to women, the different Carnival groups ([[Murga]]s, Lubolos or Parodistas) perform a kind of popular opera at the ''tablados'', singing and dancing songs that generally relate to the social and political situation. The 'Calls' groups, basically formed by drummers playing the tamboril, perform [[candombe]] rhythmic figures. Revelers wear their festival clothing. Each group has its own theme. Women wearing elegant, bright dresses are called [[Vedette (entertainer)|vedettes]] and provide a sensual touch to parades.  European [[archetypes]] ([[Pierrot]], [[Harlequin]] and [[Columbina]]) merge with African ancestral elements (the [[Matriarch|Old Mother]] or ''Mama Vieja'', the [[Medicine Man]] or ''Gramillero'' and the [[magician (paranormal)|Magician]] or ''Escobero'') in the festival.  ====Venezuela==== Carnival in Venezuela covers 2 days, 40 days before Easter. It is a time when youth in many rural towns have water fights (including the use of water balloons and water guns). Any pedestrian risks a soaking. Coastal towns and provinces celebrate Carnival more fervently than elsewhere in the country. Venezuelans regard Carnival about the same way they regard Christmas and Semana Santa (Holy Week; the week before Easter Sunday) when they take the opportunity to visit their families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeanchoice.com/venezuela/Carnival.asp |title=Carnival in Venezuela |publisher=CaribbeanChoice |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref>  ==See also== * [[Culture of Popular Laughter]] * [[Basler Fasnacht]] * [[Carny]] * [[Cologne Carnival]] * [[Careto]] * [[Fair]] * [[Federation of European Carnival Cities]] * [[Mardi Gras]] * [[Mardi Gras in Mobile]] * [[Sitalsasthi Carnival]] * [[Feast of Fools]] * [[Adloyada]]  ==Notes== {{reflist|33em}}  ==References== *[[Giampaolo di Cocco]] (2007) ''Alle origini del Carnevale: Mysteria isiaci e miti cattolici'' (Florence: Pontecorboli) *Valantasis, Richard (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-N6u74StgmUC& ''Religions of late antiquity in practice''] *McGowan, Chris and Pessanha, Ricardo.
