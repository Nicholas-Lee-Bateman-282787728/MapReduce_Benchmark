     Ohio University, also known as OU, is a major U.S. public research university located primarily on a  campus in Athens, Ohio, United States.  As one of America's oldest universities, Ohio University was chartered on February 18, 1804,Act of February 18, 1804, 2 v. L.O. p. 193.  Printed in full in  and opened for students in 1809.  Retyped & graphics rescanned by   , the Athens campus had approximately 23,300  individual students; the other five campuses had approximately 10,000  combined; and eLearning had approximately 5900 individual students.   In total, 39,201 individuals were enrolled in classes equivalent to 30,878 full time equivalent attendance. The university maintains a selective admission rate with further admission requirements for its schools. The Heritage College of Medicine maintains its separate select admissions criteria. Ohio University offers more than 250 areas of undergraduate study. On the graduate level, the university grants master's degrees in many of its major academic divisions, and doctoral degrees in selected departments. Ohio University is fully accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching classifies Ohio as a Research University (high research activity) under the Basic Classification category. Ohio's athletic teams are called the Bobcats and compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as members of the Mid-American Conference.  Ohio football has participated in nine bowl games through the 2015 season, while the men's basketball team has made 13 appearances in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship.   George Washington stated "the settlement of southeastern Ohio was not accidental, but the result of the careful deliberation of wise, prudent, and patriotic men."  The Confederation Congress, which operated under the Articles of Confederation, did not work with an executor or cabinet.  Executive roles transacted from committees of Congress or appointed persons.  The Ordinance of 1787 made Ohio University the first ever to be chartered through acts of Congress, with the very purpose of expanding education, particularly for servicemen and families.   President Thomas Jefferson's policy initiatives included a westward expansion of the new nation, with the addition of several territories to U.S. statehood. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 called for a public university as part of the settlement and eventual statehood of the Ohio Territory: "Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged." This epithet is engraved on the university's main college gateway.  In 1797, people from the first settlement of Marietta traveled upstream via the Hocking River to establish a location for the school, founding Athens due to its location directly between the original capital of Chillicothe and Marietta.  In 1802 approval was granted by the territorial government for the establishment of the American Western University, but that school was not operated under that name. Ohio University was formally established on February 18, 1804, as its charter was certified by the General Assembly of the new state. Its establishment came 11 months after Ohio was admitted to the Union. The first three students enrolled in 1809. The university graduated two students with bachelor's degrees in 1815.  The university was not gifted by the stalwart Republicans with lands and monies for the agricultural and manufacturing colleges as part of the Morrill Act of 1862. The 20th century brought unprecedented growth in student enrollment, academic offerings, and research facilities.  Between 1955 to 1970, the university realized a tripling of undergraduate enrollment (from 7,000 to 20,000) in the post-World War II expansion of college education.  University Presidents Baker and Alden served as the catalysts for such dramatic changes.  During this era, the university's campus tripled in size, with the construction of 25 new dormitories located on two new residential college greens, radio and television stations, new research and classroom facilities, and the construction of a major 13,000-seat sports arena (Convocation Center). In 1964, U.S. President Johnson publicly announced his Great Society initiative for the first time on the College Green, bringing Ohio U into homes across America and garnering news in all continents. Nearly a half century later, President Obama addressed a large university crowd, at the same location, in October 2013. In 1975, Ohio established its medical school, known as the Ohio University Heritage College of Medicine. Heritage is the only medical college in the state to award the D.O. degree. In 2011, the college received the largest private donation ever to be given to a medical college in the U.S. Ohio was classified Tier 1 University by U.S. News ranking of "Best American Colleges" at that time, and named by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a Doctoral/High Research Activity institution to reflect its growing number of graduate programs. Ohio's libraries contain more than 3 million bound volumes.Ohio University Libraries â€“ Just the Facts  Ohio's main campus is located in Athens on the Hocking River.  New England and Early Americana Federalist themes are prevalent in its architecture. Development of the campus began in 1812 with the erection of the university's remaining central building, Manasseh Cutler Hall, a designated and registered national landmark.  The Ohio originate architectural style is evident in the campus' oldest buildings located around the College Green, and since reflected throughout the entire campus. Sometimes cited as a 'public ivy' and one of the most beautiful residential campuses in America, the university has also adopted modern elements into its campus without displacing these early American period structures. The historic climate of campus and its early colonial roots prompted Time Magazine to describe the university as "Harvard on the Hocking", a reference which has grown in popularity over the years.  The College Green is the central quadrangle lawn and location of significant campus buildings:  Manasseh Cutler Hall, the Office of the President; Wilson Hall, the College of Arts and Sciences; McGuffey Hall, named for William McGuffey; and the College Gateway.  These three original primary structures are featured elements of the official current university logo. The College Green has changed little in the past two centuries, which contributes to the university's colonial appearance.  The green is based upon the classic layout of traditional English and New England towns and similar to university quadrangles. The College Green features Galbreath Chapel, the spire of which topped with a brass weather vane, is modeled after that of the portico of Nash's All Souls Church in London. Other buildings on the College Green include Chubb Hall, home to Undergraduate Admissions as well as the Offices of the Bursar and Registrar; Ellis Hall, home to the departments of English, Classics and World Religions, and Philosophy; Templeton-Blackburn Memorial Auditorium; as well as Bryan Hall, an upperclassman residence hall.  The College Green is framed by two main university gateways. Alumni Gateway, built in 1915, features verses well-known to the university community which may be read upon entering and leaving campus.  The words over the gateway are borrowed from the Latin phrase inscribed over a gateway to the University of Padua, Italy, and was dedicated at the beginning of the 20th century upon the 100th anniversary of the university's first graduating class. The newer College Gate, built in the 1960s, features words taken from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 regarding public education and its founding as one of America's first public universities. The bronze university seal, embedded at the college gate, maintains the tradition that freshman must avoid stepping upon it or risk bad fortune. The nearby chimes from the Cutler bell-tower's cupola ring out on the hour and sound the university Alma Mater at noon, which can be heard throughout the surrounding town and valley, as they have since 1820. The city of Athens, well integrated with the university, has remained adaptive to the original architecture of the community, and is well known for its streets made of red Athens Brick which augment those found on campus. There are two residence halls on the College Green.  The John Calhoun Baker University Center, which opened in January 2007, is named after John Calhoun Baker, the 14th President of Ohio. The facility replaced the original Baker Center located on East Union Street across from College Green and serves as the hub of campus activity. The $65 million student center is operated by the Division of Student Affairs and serves students, faculty, administrators, visitors and Athens community members.  Electronic maps and virtual university e-tours, available at center information desks, direct visitors across campus.  The five-story facility has been praised The Association of College Unions International for its extraordinary visual appeal and blending with the campus' historic overall classic theme. The building features Federal architecture, subtle stonework, and large windows that admit a great deal of natural light and afford expansive views of campus. In contrast to the exterior's red brick and white columns, the interior has a more contemporary style with high domed ceilings, ergonomic furniture and a color scheme of sage, plum and mocha. Terrazzo mosaics of aspects of the earth's globe are embedded in the floor of the main entrance to the building, which features an elegant rotunda with curved monumental staircase and large free-form chandelier which illuminates it. An unusual acoustical quality of the building is the fact that any individual standing at the center of the inlaid globes on the floor of the entering rotunda, when speaking, produces a unique reverberating echo, similar to same effact created at the center of the United States Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. Another unique feature is the fountain escalator system, the only escalator in southeast Ohio, intersecting the huge atrium and connecting College Green and West Green. An outdoor second floor, featuring terraced patio dining, presides over a picturesque natural pond as well as a partial view of Peden Stadium and Byrd Arena. Baker Center also contains a large food court called West 82; a fine dining restaurant called Latitude 39; a Grand Ballroom; a shop called Bobcat Depot that sells apparel, computers, and accessories; a theater; study areas; computer labs; administrative offices; and numerous conference rooms. The Front Room, a large coffee house named after a former popular university rathskeller, features a stage, artwork and a community fireplace. It serves Starbucks products and university bakery items and is housed on the fourth floor, which opens onto its own terrace as well as onto the intersection of Park Place and Court Streets, making it a hot spot for students between classes.  Other amenities include a United States Post Office and the Trisolini Art Gallery, named after a prominent Italian-American fine arts faculty member.  Vernon R. Alden Library serves the Athens campus as the central library facility and seats 3,000 people. The collection of the Ohio library contains over 2.3 million units of microfilm material, 13,500 periodical subscriptions and 3 million printed volumes, making it one of the 100 largest libraries in the United States. The university maintains a complex system of archives in its libraries.  A university archives center displays books and collections important to the university's two century history; along with a rare original hand scripted Gutenberg Bible.  The Learning Commons, located on the building's second floor, is open 24 hours, 5 days a week allowing students to meet and use parts of the facility. Laptops and other accessories are available through technology services at the reference desk. The library is organized by the Library of Congress system and no longer by the Dewey Decimal system. Outside Alden Library and directly behind Cutler Hall is Wolfe Garden, a small outside enclave in the shape of the State of Ohio, and features native Ohio trees and plants, providing a contemplative respite for reading and thinking. The oldest green, there are twelve residence halls on East Green.  This area of the university includes three of the steepest walkways at the hilly Athens campus:  Morton Hill, the Bryan Hall terrace and staircase, and Jefferson Hill.  Each walkway is well-lit, and affords East Green residents easy access to classrooms if they are willing to walk or bicycle. The East Green's Scott Quad, as lore maintains, is a residence hall that provides for a successful relationship to those who kiss beneath its gateway arch. South Green includes areas near Emeriti Park, and extends along the Hocking River valley. There are twenty-four residence halls on South Green, following the addition of four new residence halls in the summer of 2015.https://www.ohio.edu/housing/rs/halls/view_profile.php?hall=HDNE The South Green is home to several facilities, including:  The Charles J. Ping Center is one of the largest recreational facilities in the nation. Covering  on three floors, Ping houses a , double-sided climbing wall, five basketball/volleyball courts, two multipurpose gymnasiums, an elevated four-lane indoor running track, eight racquetball courts and an enclosed glass fitness area. Ping Center also provides free weight and cardio rooms, aerobics and fitness classes, combative sports, dance, meeting rooms and personal training. The recreation center also houses club sports and intramural sports.  Construction began in 1994 and it opened in January 1996. Ping was named in honor of the 18th president of Ohio University, Charles J. Ping. Ping is also one of the largest student employers on campus, allowing for the facility to be one of the few campus rec centers that is almost solely student run. West Green includes buildings around the western part of the Athens campus.  The Ohio Athletic Mall spans the western portion of the campus, near the end of the Athens bike path at the Union street crossing.  The mall features lacrosse, baseball, track, field and related athletic venues. Along the surrounding the Hocking River, are a series of sakura trees planted to commemorate the university's historic partnership with Chubu University. Japanese Students sponsor an annual "Sakura Festival"  each year, a cultural event celebrating the visually dramatic blossoming of the cherry trees and their evening lightings. Anchoring West Green quadrangle is the Stocker Center, which houses Russ College of Engineering.  There are eight residence halls on the West Green.  The West Green also includes: Ohio has been cited for academic quality and value by publications Fortune, U.S. News and World Report, BusinessWeek, Forbes, America's 100 Best College Buys, Princeton Review's Best Colleges, and Peterson's Guide to Competitive Colleges. The John Templeton Foundation has also recognized Ohio University as one of the top character-building institutions in the country.  The Chronicle of Higher Education has recognized the university as one of the top producers of U.S. Fulbright scholars by type of institution, with the highest number of recipients in the state as well as the Mid-American Conference in 2011-12.  Its total number of Fulbright winners frequently ranks the university first in the state and places the university in the company of Boston College, Princeton University, and UCLA. Ohio University was recognized by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs as a top producer of 2014-2015 Fulbright U.S. Students. Ohio pursues an enrollment process with selective admissions criteria, and a current admission rate of 69% of applicants.  Total surveyed student demographic: African-Americans account for 5%; (1,061); Asian Americans 1.3% (270); Caucasians 84.6% (17,926); Hispanic 1.9% (411); International 6.8% (1,437); and Native American and American Indian 0.4% (77).

The total university student enrollment is in excess of 39,000, encompassing its main campus in Athens and regional campuses. Students are organized into several colleges according to their interests.  The academic organization of students includes the following areas of specialization.  The College of Arts and Sciences continues to provide the first degrees offered by the university, the B.A. and B.S., and is the largest college on the Athens campus with 18 departments and a variety of interdisciplinary programs, research centers, and institutes. The foundational instruction for the university, delivered through the general education and liberal arts curriculum, is centered in its departments. The college provides the primary instruction for approximately one-third of the majors on campus. At the graduate level, the college offers a variety of masters programs, and eight departments offer doctoral degrees. A range of scholarly pursuits, funded research projects, and creative activities are undertaken by the college's students, staff, and faculty. Incoming students with an ACT of 25 or higher may apply for The Scholars Program in Arts and Sciences. This integrated learning experience allows selected first-year scholars a jump-start towards their academic goals by offering an intensive year-long interaction with highly regarded faculty. Juniors or seniors who maintain at least a 3.5 GPA may be eligible to graduate with "departmental honors." The opportunity to create a research project and/or write a thesis is provided by many departments in the College of Arts and Sciences for highly motivated students. Some students elect to finish two majors or two degrees for optimum use of their undergraduate years, while others add value by completing a minor and/or certificate program from the many offered.  A full language curriculum features programs in Spanish, French, Russian, Italian, German, Latin and Swahili. The College of Business was established in 1927.  It offers nine different majors and a general business minor for students with non-business majors. Following University-wide restructuring in 2010, it includes the Department of Sports Administration, which offers students an undergraduate degree in Sport Management and three graduate programs. Despite University measures to increase enrollment, the college is smaller than other national business schools, and all business classes are taught by professors instead of graduate students. The college also offers an MBA program for Indian students in Christ University Bangalore.  The college requires students take four classes in a 'cluster' format, or simultaneous sequencing. In the cluster, students are teamed up and complete research projects. The students then receive a grade in all four of their classes on the project. This program is an opportunity for students of different majors to interact and is considered a good illustration of how situations are often structured in the business world.College of Business â€“ Cluster Classes  The School of Accountancy is nationally recognized. The school promotes the Business Activity Model in its intermediate classes that has proven beneficial. Designed to mimic the experiences of an auditor, accounting students often credit the model with preparing them for internships. One of the authors of business activity model, Connie Esmond-Kiger, was named Director of the School of Accountancy in 2007. She is also the adviser for Ohio's chapter of Beta Alpha Psi, the financial majors fraternity. Ohio's chapter maintains Superior status and has won national awards.Chapter Honors and Awards The Schey Sales Centre was initiated in 1997 by the Ohio Board of Trustees and offers a professional sales certificate to students.Producers sold on university's Sales Centre This certificate is open to any Ohio student, and requires students to complete 28 credit hours of sales classes as well as complete a 300-hour sales internship. Three entities oversee the program: the Professional Sales Advisory Board (PSAB), which is composed of sales professionals who give back to the program with money or advice on the industry changes; the support staff, which includes professors at Ohio University who advise the students in the program; and lastly, a group of students who run the program and they are referred to as The Candidate Advisory Council, which was created in 2004. The centre hosts a sales symposium each spring quarter where professional speakers address market changes, sales strategies and profit. Additionally, sales students took home first place at the National Collegiate Sales Competition in 2009.  There are 16 active student organizations functioning within the college. Chapters of three national business fraternities, the Christian Business Leadership organization, and societies or fraternities for almost every major mark these.College of Business â€“ Student Clubs and Organizations  Copeland Hall, seat of the college, maintains six computer labs and two study lounges with computers, as well as many conference rooms and small group rooms. The college's Student Equity Management Group, started in 2003, uses $1 million from the University to invest. Unlike many other schools, Ohio's group is open to all undergraduate students and is completely student run. The group's portfolio has increased by 51.29%, since its inception, beating the S&P 500 by 42.61%.Students prove they are ready for Equity Careers  The Candidate Advisory Council is a student-centered organization is run by the students and entirely self-funded. They pay for their classes, professors, events and resources. The university does not assist with any of the financial responsibility. Money is collected from companies who invest in the program solely to recruit the 200+ students working towards a sales certificate. Ohio University Scripps College of Communication comprises five schools and one research lab (see 'Research Centers'): The E.W. Scripps School of Journalism, the J. W. McClure School of Information and Telecommunication Systems, the School of Communication Studies, the School of Media Arts and Studies (formerly the School of Telecommunications), the School of Visual Communication, and the Game Research and Immersive Design (GRID) Lab.
