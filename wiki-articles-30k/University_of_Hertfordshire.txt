In accordance with tradition, Hertfordshire's academic dress consists of a gown, a cap and a hood. The black gown and square cap familiar to all readers of the Beano had evolved into their present form in England by the end of the Reformation. The hood, which is now the distinctive mark of a university-level qualification, is a medieval in origin, and was originally functional.Christianson and Piggott, Academic Dress in the University of Hertfordshire, ISBN 978-1-898543-01-5; 2ed ISBN 1-905313-39-X The ceremonial mace was produced in 1999 by craftsman Martyn Pugh, a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, member of the British Jewellers Association and a Founder Member of the Association of British Designer Silversmiths. Its design supposedly symbolises the University's origins, expertise and associations. Its shape is inspired by the shape of an aeroplane wing symbolising the university's origin in the aviation industry. The head of the mace is engraved with zodiac symbols representing the university's contribution to astronomy and also contains the DNA double helix representing the biological sciences and microprocessor chips representing information and communications technology.Martyn Pugh, Furniture - at Commission a Craftsman The University's coat of arms was granted in 1992. The shield is charged with an oak tree taken from the coat of arms of the former Hatfield Rural District, the constellation Perseus (containing the binary star Algol) and a representation of the letter "H" recalling the emblem of the former Hatfield Polytechnic. The crest, a Phoenix rising from an astral crown, represents the University's evolution from a technical college training apprentices for the aviation industry. The two harts supporting the shield represent the county of Hertfordshire, with the covered cups referring to A.S. Butler, who donated the land upon which the original campus was built. A scroll bears the motto Seek Knowledge Throughout Life.Myth, Mystery and Materiality Futures, Winter 2010, p. 9 The standard University logo comprises the University name and the UH symbol in a horizontal panel.

The University of Hertfordshire was awarded Entrepreneurial University of the Year 2010 by the Times Higher Education. In September 2015, it has been revealed by Complete University Guide that University of Hertfordshire has the lowest recorded ‘student-relevant’ crimes in the East of England.  It is the fourth year the university has had the lowest rate of recorded crime in the East of England. The last Quality Assurance Agency institutional audit for the University was in March 2009. The outcome was that 'confidence can reasonably be placed in the soundness of the institution's present and likely future management of the academic standards of the awards that it offers'. According to the complaint statistics, from the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, the university issued 69 completion of procedures letters in relation to student complaints, in 2013. This is below the band medium of 81, possibly suggesting greater student satisfaction when compared to university's of a similar size.http://www.oiahe.org.uk/media/93652/university_of_hertfordshire_2013_annual_letter.pdf The OIA received 22 complaints in 2013. This is above the band medium of 18.5, possibly suggesting that more students are dissatisfied with the outcome of internal complaints procedure's, compared to university's of a similar size. The university has also never been named in an OIA annual report for a shortfall in practice, or a failure to comply with a recommendation set by the Adjudicator. The University has three research institutes: Health and Human Sciences Research Institute; Science and Technology Research Institute; Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities Research Institute. Also an expanding research profile with key strengths in areas of nursing, psychology, history, philosophy, physics and computer science. Over 650 research students at the University enjoy benefits such as the Doctoral College which helps with all key milestones of the research degree process for students and their supervisors. It also provides research training for students and staff The University's research impact for history when compared to all UK universities was rated the best and its quality of history research topped all other University Alliance Group universities. The University also did particularly well in Nursing which achieved 82% 3 and 4 star ratings and Philosophy which made a huge leap from 35% of its research being awarded 3 and 4 star ratings in 2008 to 66% in 2015. Over 650 research students at the University enjoy benefits such as the Doctoral College which helps with all key milestones of the research degree process for students and their supervisors. It also provides research training for students and staff. Hertfordshire archives it research through University of Hertfordshire Research Archive (UHRA), a showcase of the research produced by the University of Hertfordshire. Research in UHRA can be viewed and downloaded freely by researchers and students all over the world. In recognition of development activities related to research careers and the position of researchers at the University, the European Commission awarded University of Hertfordshire the right to use the HR Excellence in Research logo in spring 2010. The logo demonstrates that the working conditions and career opportunities of research staff at University of Hertfordshire comply with recommendations given by the European Commission in The European Charter for Researchers and The Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The Charter & Code aim to give equal rights and obligations to individual researchers throughout Europe, therefore improving mobility and working conditions as well as reinforcing research and development across Europe. The award represents independent acknowledgement of the policies, working practices and processes in place to ensure researchers at Hertfordshire are equipped to start their research effectively, work in a supportive and stimulating environment, and access the training and development they need to be successful in their work and career. Over 55 per cent of the University’s research has been rated ‘world leading’ and ‘internationally excellent’ in the UK Government’s 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) announced last 18 December 2014. Fifty seven percent of the University's research submissions achieved a 4 or 3 star rating. This is an increase of 11% when compared to the results of assessment in 2008. In 2014, it claimed the top impact for History for the results of REF, indicating that all of its submission in History is deemed 'outstanding'. The University of Hertfordshire houses art collection, the Bayfordbury Observatory, Crush Radio, Kaspar, Park and Ride among its facilities. In an interview with the Times Higher Education, Andrew May, the Director of Estates, Hospitality and Contract Services at the University of Hertfordshire has asserted that what the University aims to do was to utilise the estates strategy as the delivery vehicle for driving corporate and cultural change. In 1992, it established University of Hertfordshire Press,  whose first publication was a book celebrating the institution’s change in status from polytechnic to university.  The University of Hertfordshire holds over 450 artworks in its art collection. The ethos of the UH Art Collection is to present modern and contemporary art in places where people study, work and visit. This reflects the University of Hertfordshire’s determination to provide not only an attractive education setting but also one which will inform, enlighten and enhance the life of its students, staff and the local community. The UH Art Collection was established in 1952, as part of Hertfordshire Country Council's commitment to the post-war programme. The collection has a diverse portfolio including photography, textile, ceramics, sculpture, mixed media and works by Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Andy Goldsworthy, Alan Davie, and Diane MacLean. Situated approximately  from the main campus in Hatfield, Bayfordbury Observatory is one of the astronomical teaching observatories in the United Kingdom. The observatory has formed an integral part of the University of Hertfordshire's astronomy-related degree programmes since it opened in 1970 and is used by students from the first week of their degree through to their final year, when it can also be used for their final year projects. The Bayfordbury observatory also houses a flight simulator, wind tunnels and a simulated intensive care unit, and is regarded as one of the best teaching observatories in the UK. The seven optical telescopes at Bayfordbury campus allow students to observe detailed images of objects in space. They can be equipped with a variety of research-grade CCD cameras, high resolution spectrographs or high frame-rate video cameras. Moreover, the five newest telescopes are also able to be operated remotely, and students and staff can request observations via the internet and have images taken automatically when the weather allows. The 4.5-metre radio telescope and 3-dish 115-metre baseline interferometer allow a completely different view of the universe. These are connected to 21&nbsp;cm line receivers, to detect the neutral hydrogen in the galaxy and extragalactic radio sources. Crush Radio (formally known as Campus Radio Hatfield [CRH] CRUSH and more recently, Crush 1278) is the student radio station of the University of Hertfordshire. Crush is run by students of the university along with amateurs from around the surrounding areas. Crush was the first campus radio, often called student radio, station in the UK. Crush was founded in 1960 under the name of CRH (Campus Radio Hatfield). After starting as a, so called, "pirate radio station" CRH was turned into a University Society of the University of Hertfordshire and was renamed Crush 1278 for it broadcast on 1278AM frequency. As Crush became more accessible, via the internet, the name was changed again to Crush Radio. In 2009 Crush as a society merged with the other media societies of the Students union and the University of Hertfordshire as one media society, though Crush still uses its own website and broadcasts over 1278AM frequency, however it stopped broadcasting on 1278AM after the move in September 2009, but restarted commencing February 2011. Crush Radio has been broadcasting since 1960. It broadcasts on AM frequency (1278) and also streams online. Kaspar, a social robot, has been designed by the University of Hertfordshire's Adaptive Systems Research Group (ASRG). The Kaspar project began in 2005, drawing upon previous researches to develop a social robot for engaging autistic children in a variety of play scenarios.The aim was to research whether interacting and communicating with Kaspar would help children with autism interact and communicate more easily with people. This is important because there is mounting evidence that early intervention for children with autism may change the child's development trajectory. Kaspar is a research tool with programmed responses adapted to be used by an autistic child in a safe, non-judgemental environment. The Kaspar research has shown that robots may provide a safe and predictable tool for children with autism, that enables the children to learn social interaction and communication skills, addressing specific therapeutic and educational objectives (for example, being able to engage in direct eye-contact or shared eye-gaze), in an enjoyable play context. Hertfordshire operates a regular shuttle bus service, Park and Ride, which connects 800 parking spaces at Angerland Common with its College Lane and de Havilland Campus facilities. The scheme started in 2006, when it is initially provided the 700-car facility at Angerland Common, off South Way, Hatfield, in a bid to get cars off surrounding roads. Since 2006, University plans on opening a second venue, with 150 spaces, at the south side car park at Stanborough Lakes in Welwyn Garden City.   Uno (formerly UniversityBus) is a bus service operated by the University of Hertfordshire, serving members of the general public, and also its own students and staff, at a discounted rate. In 1992, the University of Hertfordshire wanted to create and provide a bus service to and from the University. Uno, previously known as UniversityBus, was created to provide student transport to the University from local areas; improve east-west travel across the county of Hertfordshire; and, to create new links between Hertfordshire and North London. UniversityBus became Uno in 2005, a bus service not only for University staff and students but also the entire Hertfordshire community. The name ‘Uno’ stems from the University’s desire for this bus service to become everyone’s number one choice for travel. It provides student transport to the expanding university from local areas as well as improving east-west travel across Hertfordshire and has opened up new links from North London. Services have expanded rapidly as the University has closed outlying sites at Watford and Hertford and developed the new de Havilland Campus on the site of the former Hatfield Aerodrome. Other developments on this site, including business premises for companies such as Veolia, DHL and T-mobile have also provided passengers. Uno also operate urban bus networks in St Albans and Northampton, as well as a network of routes between Milton Keynes, Bedford and Flitwick for Cranfield University. During term time, Uno bus runs every 7–8 minutes. It is located off Junction 2 of the A1(M) on Southway (A1001), the parking area is only 5 minutes from the M25 and 10 minutes from the M1. One major complaint from its students is that one has to pay the exact amount of the fare since no change is given.  The main source of nightlife is the Forum, which offers live entertainment and club facilities for the region of Hertfordshire. With a total capacity of 2,000, the Forum houses three entertainment spaces, a restaurant, a café, multiple bars and onsite parking. The 'local pub' on campus, the revamped Ele house, holds seats, big screen TVs, and pool tables providing a convenient location to socialise. Hertfordshire Students' Union (HSU) is the Students' Union of the University of Hertfordshire. The Students’ Union Social Centre was opened in 1977. The Hatfield Technical College’s management encouraged the establishment of a Student Representative Council (SRC) in 1982, to create a sense of unity and expand the social activities of its day students. The SRC was affiliated to the National Union of Students but initially restricted itself largely to social activities. After 1988 it began to campaign on issues such as improvements to the canteen, lifting the ban on religious or political activity within the then Hatfield Polytechnic, and for a formal students’ union. The sectarian ban was finally lifted in 1992 and a Union granted in 1995. However, the canteen continued to be an issue throughout the 2000s. The Students' Union at the University of Hertfordshire represents all students in the university by organising campus activities and running different clubs and societies, from sports to entertainment. University of Hertfordshire has a rich history in public events, lectures, and seminars that dates back to its antecedent institution, Hatfield Technical College. Often, several notable figures, authors, researchers, inventors, and leaders would take to the stage of Weston Auditorium before an audience (made of staff, students, and the general public). With its technical facilities and 450 seating capacity, the auditorium stages performing arts events throughout the year, including film, music, theatre and dance. The The essence of the University of Hertfordshire's public events is to be a ‘good neighbour’ to those living and working in Hertfordshire. We aim to be seen as a valued resource for local people and organisations; to be at the heart of key local strategic partnerships; and to engage with and be valued by all parts of our community. In September 2015, in a bid to share ideas with the public and gain new perspectives, academics from University of Hertfordshire have collaborated with Café Scientifique, a grassroots public science initiative currently running in more than 40 towns across the United Kingdom and cities in other countries. At least twelve cafés outside the UK are organised by the British Council alone. Similar but independent events have also sprung up in many cities using variations of the "Café Scientifique" or "Science Café" monikers. The event was held at Red Lion, a pub at Hatfield. The university holds a number of formal links with top-ranking institutions from around the world to share teaching and research and facilitate staff and student exchanges. Aside from its international partners, the University has also strong regional agenda and a number of partner institutions in the region: Elstree University Technical College a new university technical college located in Borehamwood; The Watford UTC, a 14-19 University Technical College for the Watford area.Watford Observer, http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/11396051.parking_concerns_could_put_the_breaks_on_watford_university_technical_college/ The UTC specialises in Event Management and Computer Sciences. Hertfordshire has more than 5,200 international students and a global network of more than 160,000 alumni.
