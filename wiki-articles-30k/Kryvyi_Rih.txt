 Kryvyi Rih or Krivoi Rog ( ;Oxford Dictionaries. "Kryvyi Rih". Oxford University Press, 2013. Accessed 27 August 2013.  , Crooked Horn) is a city in the Dnipropetrovsk region of Ukraine; it is the 8th most populous city in the country. It lies within a large urban area, administratively incorporated with Kryvyi Rih Municipality as a city of region significance. It also serves as the administrative center of the district although it is not part of it. The city extends for 126&nbsp;km from north to south. Standing on the Saksahan and Inhulets river, Kryvyi Rih has been a major settlement for most of its history, going back to its founding as a postal city in 1775 by the Cossacks. A military settlement until 1860, it formed part of Kherson, although it was incorporated during the 20th century with areas of Yekaterinoslav. The township began to expand "at an astonishing rate" at the beginning of the 1880s. Kryvyi Rih's urbanization was unplanned; French and English investment arrived due to a boom in metallurgy, iron mining and investigation of rich deposits of iron ore. The building of the Yekateryninska Railway in 1884 - built for transportation of ore to the Donbas - transformed Kryvyi Rih into a major industrial town that culminated in city status in 1919. Nationalization and investment spurred by Soviet authorities led to extensive growth. In 1934 Kryvorizhstal was built, the first of more than 500 factories. The city also gave rise to the foundation of Kryvyi Rih National University. Financially, the city's growth after the Nazi occupation increased due to economic reforms. Also, investment spurred by Ukrainian Independence, market economy and the 2014 revolution led to extensive regeneration, particularly in the city centre.  Kryvyi Rih is arguably the main steel-industry city of Eastern Europe, being a large globally important centre of the iron-ore mining and metallurgy region - the Kryvbas. Its oblast economy is the third-largest in Ukraine. Богатые и бедные регионы Украины: таблица. Vedomosti  The city was founded in the 18th century by Zaporozhian Cossacks. Kryvyi Rih in Ukrainian literally means Crooked Horn. According to local legend, the city was founded by a crooked (Ukrainian slang for one-eyed) Cossack named Rih. However, records pre-dating the existence of the city refer to the area by the same name, due to the shape of the landmass formed by the merging of the river Saksahan into the Inhulets. Ingulets Palanka (Zaporizhian Sich administrative division) was established in 1734, and a list of villages and winterings from that time mentions Kryvyi Rih. In 1770 the camp of Zaporizhian Sich was founded,В. Ізмайлов.

On May 8, 1775, after the end of the Russian-Turkish War, Russian authorities opened a postal station and track which linked Kremenchuk, Kinburn foreland and Ochakov, all locations of the Imperial Russian Army. The station was tended by 5 cossacks. Kryvyi Rih entered the 1800s as a village,Перелік (Списку) казенних селищ Херсонського й Олександрійського повітів, які у 1816 - 1817 р.р. були звернені у військові поселення the largest industrial enterprises of the town being 3 water mills.

In 1880, with 5 million francs of capital, Paul founded the "French Society of Kryvyi Rih Ores". In 1882 16.4 thousand tons of ore were extracted from the outskirts by 150 workers. A centre of capitalism, the region was the greatest area of ore extraction in Russia, and the first underground mine of the basin began to function in 1886. A new branch of industry - metallurgy - was founded in 1892, when the first blast furnace of Hdantsivka Ironworks was started. center Olexander Paul studied in detail the iron ore and proved its commercial value Ore quarry in 1899 Joltaia Reka Iron Mining Company share, 1899 Poshtovaya Street about 1900 Krivoy Rog Mutual Credit Society Region map in 1914 The export of ore in Silesia soon began. 5 schoolsДіловий і комерційний Кривий Ріг. 1914 р and an aerial cableway were created in the town, and the development of the city attracted new people looking for a quick profit.Гірничо-заводський листок №4,1902р The supply of mined ore far exceeded the demand, and so many mines completely suspended their work, while others had to reduce their workers and output by more than half. Workers did not have proper conditions, social security, or contracts, and they were prone to combinations of lung cancer, tuberculosis and asthma. Thousands of people who worked in the mines and the factories were left without employment. At the same time, the city began to develop the ideas of socialism and democracy. However, there were also several terrorist attacks and strikes, and 1905 brought anti-Jewish pogroms and repressions. The First World War interrupted access to the export markets, and a lot of workers were called to the front. The city survived Soldier and Worker's Deputies in 1917.

It was founded by Uyezd as part of the Yekaterinoslav Governorate. It included 30 volosts. In late 1919, it was briefly ruled by the Volunteer Army. On January 17, 1920 the Red Army finally took Kryvyi Rih. City's population totaled 22,571.

Being evacuated from 20 September 1941 to August 1944, the Government, factories and Kryvyi Rih Institute worked in Nizhny Tagil. Germans immediately began to build up local government, installing executives, gendarmerie and police forces. Ukrainian national liberation movement in Krivoy Rog was organized by marching groups OUN. The answer came in the ethnic cleansing of Ukrainians as well as large-scale holocaust. On October 13, 1941 700 people were executed, from October 1941 to April 1942 - 6293 persons, in August 1943 - 13 people.
