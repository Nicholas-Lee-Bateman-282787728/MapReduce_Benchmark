He achieved this feat at the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics, becoming the most successful athlete there.  This makes him one of only three Olympians to win four gold medals during the same Winter Games. He repeated this medal haul at the Biathlon World Championships 2005 in Hochfilzen, Austria and at the Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

This was the second time that Norway had won a title in this event, with the other being at the 2002 Winter Olympics (also anchored by Bjørndalen). With this victory he became the second most decorated Winter Olympian of all time and one of only two athletes to win 11 medals at the Winter Olympics. With his gold medal in 10&nbsp;km sprint at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, he tied fellow Norwegian Bjørn Dæhlie for most Winter Olympic medals, with 12 in total.  As of February 19, 2014, Bjørndalen has won eight Olympic gold medals, four silver and a bronze.  He has also won 19 World Championship gold medals, 12 silver and nine bronze (more than anybody in biathlon history), along with a record 95 World Cup victories in biathlon and 1 World Cup victory in cross-country skiing, 175 podium finishes in biathlon individual races and 3 in cross-country skiing.

Bjørndalen lay in third place in the standings going into the last three races of the season in Holmenkollen, with Poirée in first, and Fischer in second. However, Bjørndalen won all three races, giving him six victories in the last eight races, and clinching the crystal globe.

This put his career victories at the ski events to five, having won once both in 2003 (pursuit) and in 2004 (sprint). Bjørndalen made a perfect start to the season, winning all of the first five races in Östersund and Hochfilzen.  In the fifth race of the season, the pursuit race in Hochfilzen, he won with one of his largest margins ever, more than 2 minutes.  On 30 December 2006 Bjørndalen took part in the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen in the Veltins Arena. In front of about 51,000 people he won it for fourth time in a row.

In Ruhpolding he led his team-mates to victory in the relay event. He won the two following individual competitions.  After competing in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships Sapporo 2007, he missed several Biathlon World Cup events; after missing eight competitions altogether Bjørndalen finished second in the overall standings, after German Michael Greis.

He missed the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen, focusing on training instead. After the break, he returned with victories in both the sprint and pursuit events in Ruhpolding and a third place in the mass start in Oberhof. At the Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, during the men's 12.5&nbsp;km pursuit, Bjørndalen with at least 15 other competitors accidentally skied the wrong way at the start of the first lap due to the bad marking. Just after leaving the start, the athletes skied over a bridge instead of skiing beside it, which was the right way. A jury meeting decided to give all these athletes a one-minute time penalty, following a complaint from the Russian team. However, another complaint by seven other member states led to the Appeal Jury reverting to the original result. Along with Bjørndalen's first ever 20&nbsp;km individual World Championship title, he won four out of six possible gold medals (10&nbsp;km sprint, 12.5&nbsp;km pursuit, 20&nbsp;km individual and the 4 × 7.5&nbsp;km relay). After the World Championships Bjørndalen came second in the sprint in Vancouver, he took over the world cup overall lead.
