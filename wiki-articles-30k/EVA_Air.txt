     EVA Airways Corporation (pronounced "E-V-A Air(lines)"; ) () is a Taiwanese international airline based at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport near Taipei, Taiwan, operating passenger and dedicated cargo services to over 40 international destinations in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America."Taiwan's EVA Air to launch charter flights to Saipan". AFX News Limited. 2007-03-22. Retrieved 2008-09-07  EVA Air is largely privately owned and flies a fully international route network.Thomas, Geoffrey. EVA Air: The Stealth Airline. Air Transport World, June 2003, p. 52-54. It is the second largest Taiwanese airline. EVA Air is headquartered in Luzhu, Taoyuan City, Taiwan. Since its founding in 1989 as an affiliate of shipping conglomerate Evergreen Group,Ionides, Nicholas. Evergreen Optimism: EVA Air. Airline Business, May 2002, Vol. 18 Issue 5, p. 76-78. EVA Air has expanded to include air cargo, airline catering, ground handling, and aviation engineering services. Its cargo arm, EVA Air Cargo, links with the Evergreen worldwide shipping network on sea and land. Its domestic and regional subsidiary, UNI Air, operates a medium and short-haul network to destinations in Taiwan, Macau and China with its main hub in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. As of January 2015, EVA Air is the 3rd safest airline in the world, with no hull losses, accidents, or fatalities since its establishment. EVA Air operates a mixed fleet of Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas aircraft, with Airbus A330, Boeing 747, Airbus A321, MD 90, and Boeing 777 airliners primarily used on passenger routes, along with Boeing 747 and MD-11 freighters used on cargo routes. The airline was one of the first carriers to introduce the Premium Economy class (called Elite class in EVA Air), which it debuted in 1991. Elite class is onboard Boeing 777 and selected Boeing 747 aircraft. In September 1988, during the 20th anniversary celebration of Evergreen Marine Corporation’s founding, company chairman Chang Yung-fa announced his company’s intentions to establish Taiwan’s first private international airline. The opportunity to create a major Taiwanese airline had just arisen following a decision by the Taiwanese government to liberalise the country’s air transportation system. Government requirements still mandated global experience and financial capital requirements for any company seeking permission to initiate international airline service from Taiwan.‘’Lloyd’s List,” Evergreen: Evergreen Ambitions Reach for the Skies, August 1994, p. 24–26. Upon recipient of regulatory approval, EVA Airways Corporation was formally established in March 1989. The airline was originally to be called Evergreen Airways, however this was deemed too similar to the unrelated Evergreen International cargo airline. In October 1989, the newly formed EVA Airways Corporation placed a US$3.6 billion order for 26 aircraft from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, including Boeing 747-400 and MD-11 airliners. Operations began on 1 July 1991 with a small fleet of EVA Air Boeing 767-300ER aircraft featuring business and economy class seating.Edwards, Graham, and Endres, Gunter. Jane's Airline Recognition Guide. Smithsonian Collins, 1996, p. 180. ISBN 0-06-113729-4 Initial destinations from Taipei were Bangkok, Seoul, Jakarta, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. By the end of the year, the EVA Air network had expanded to include additional cities in East Asia and its first European destination, Vienna. First year revenues reached US$40 million. In 1992, EVA Air received the first of its Boeing 747-400 aircraft on order, and launched its premium economy class, "Economy Deluxe", on its 747 transpacific flights to Los Angeles, beginning in December of that year. EVA Air's premium economy cabin, one of the first in the airline industry, featured a wider 2-4-2 abreast configuration, legrests, individual seatback video, and enhanced meal services. EVA Air's Economy Deluxe cabin (later renamed "Evergreen Deluxe" and "Elite Class") proved popular with the traveling public. For international services, EVA Air's 747s were configured with 104 premium economy seats as part of a 370-seat, four-class cabin, in addition to first, business and economy classes. In 1993, EVA Air added flights to Seattle, New York, Bangkok and Vienna with the Boeing 747-400. By 1994, EVA Air was providing regular service to 22 destinations worldwide, and carrying over 3 million passengers annually. In 1995, the airline posted its first profit on revenues of US$1.05 billion, one year ahead of schedule. Internationally, EVA Air's rapid expansion and increased passenger volume was boosted by its safety record, in contrast to its primary competitor, China Airlines.Sicherheitsbilanz 2006 (Safety record 2006) Aero International, March 2007, p. 93 In addition to receiving IOSA (IATA Operational Safety Audit) certification, EVA Air in 1997 achieved simultaneous official ISO 9002 certification in the areas of Passenger, Cargo, and Maintenance Services. Dedicated EVA Air Cargo operations began in April 1995, with the first weekly McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter flights to Taipei, Singapore, Penang, San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. EVA Air Cargo's fleet was expanded to five freighters by the end of the year. Previously, EVA Air Cargo operations mainly relied on passenger aircraft cargo space. In the mid–1990s, EVA Air expanded into the domestic Taiwan market by acquiring shares in Makung International Airlines, followed by Great China Airlines and Taiwan Airways. On 1 July 1998, all three carriers, as well as EVA's existing domestic operations, merged under the UNI Air title. UNI Air became EVA Air's domestic intra-Taiwanese subsidiary, operating shorthaul flights out of its base in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's southern port and second-largest city. In 2000, EVA Air embarked on its first major long-haul fleet renewal. The airline became one of the launch customers for the Boeing 777-300ER, ordering four aircraft plus eight options. At the same time, the airline placed three orders for the Boeing 777-200LR. In January 2001, EVA Air ordered its first Airbus aircraft, the A330-200. The Boeing 777 aircraft were intended for United States and European services, while the Airbus A330 aircraft were intended for regional Asian routes. In 2001, EVA Air began listing public stock offerings on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Initially, one percent of the company's shares was offered over-the-counter, with one-quarter held by parent company Evergreen Marine Corporation and EVA Air employees, respectively. In 2002, EVA Air underwent internal corporate reforms, with staff reductions and streamlined management. This culminated a process which had begun in 1997, when the Asian financial crisis began affecting profitability. The 2002–2003 SARS contagion also affected passenger traffic for medium-haul flights in Southeast Asia, while long-haul flights to North America, Japan, and Europe were less affected. In 2004, EVA Air converted its remaining eight options for Boeing 777-300ERs into firm orders. The first Boeing 777-300ER entered service as EVA Air's new flagship aircraft in July 2005. With the arrival of its new Boeing 777s, EVA Air launched a comprehensive revamp of its cabins, introducing lie-flat seats in its new Premium Laurel business class cabin, and upgrading its premium economy product to the new Elite Class cabin.EVA to unveil new Boeing 777. Travel Weekly, Issue 1789, 30 November 2005, p 61–61. The airline's A330s were introduced with two-class Premium Laurel and Economy cabins. In December 2005, EVA Air and its associated divisions had 5,098 employees, and the airline's network spanned 40 passenger destinations worldwide, with additional cargo destinations. In 2007, EVA Air announced a nonstop Taipei to New York (John F. Kennedy International Airport) service, to be operated with its new long-range Boeing 777-300ERs. At the same time, the airline withdrew passenger service from Taipei to Paris. On 31 October 2008, EVA Air announced a resumption of Taipei to Paris service with thrice-weekly passenger flights beginning 21 January 2009. In 2008, the airline also announced the suspension of services to Auckland. The carrier also prepared to increase direct flights to China, after initiating weekly charter flights in July 2008 following changes to the Three Links travel agreements.  For the 2007–2008 period, EVA Air coped with a 34% surge in fuel prices, which contributed to a US$61.2 million 2007 loss.World Airline Report. Air Transport World, July 2008, p. 70 In August 2008, EVA Air reported a second quarterly loss due to increased fuel costs. In response, the airline implemented cost-saving measures, including flight schedule reductions and fee increases. In early 2008, EVA Air's business office in El Segundo, California, announced a major staff reduction, with over half the staff advised that they would no longer be employed by May 2008. Functions performed by those local staff were shifted to Taiwan by half, such as the reservation center. EVA Air carried 6.2 million passengers in 2007, and employed 4,800 staff members as of April 2008. The carrier returned to profitability in the first quarter of 2009, with a US$5.9 million net gain. In August 2010, EVA Air was named one of the top 10 international airlines in Travel+Leisure's World's Best Awards. In 2010, EVA Air released a newsflash about their service to Toronto, which began on 29 March 2010. In November 2010, EVA Air began nonstop flights connecting the inner-city Taipei Songshan and Tokyo Haneda airports. In 2010, Chang Kuo-wei, son of Chang Yung-fa, returned to serve as EVA Air's president, and the carrier recorded increased sales and yearly profits. In early 2011, the carrier announced that it had applied for airline alliance membership with Star Alliance, and later that year clarified that it was in talks to join either Oneworld or Star Alliance by 2013. In June 2011, the carrier began nonstop flights from Taipei to Guam, and in October 2011 the carrier announced nonstop service from New York (JFK) to Taipei. On 27 March 2012, EVA Air announced that it would join Star Alliance in 2013. On 24 September 2012 EVA Air signed a partnership with Amadeus IT Group Altéa suite for its Altéa Revenue Management system.  On 18 June 2013, EVA Air became a full member of Star Alliance.  In October 2014, EVA AIR announced to expand its North American network by adding new routes to Houston in 2015 and Chicago in 2016, alone with expanding 55 flights per week to 63 flights per week to North America. The Houston route launch will be complimented by the introduction of the seventh and last Hello Kitty jet, Kikilala-themed "Shining Star" Boeing 777-300ER. In October 2015, EVA AIR announced its intent to purchase up to 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and two additional 777-300ER (Extended Range) jetliners from Boeing. EVA Airways will join the 787-10 launch customer team. In November 2015, Eva Air unrevealed a new livery on their 22nd 777 along with new boarding music and improved service onboard. In January 2016, Evergreen Group chairman Chang Yung-fa passed away, leaving the company to his son from the second marriage, Chang Kuo-Wei.  As of 2011, EVA Air's corporate leadership is headed by Chairman Lin Bou-shiu and President Chang Kuo-wei. EVA Air's president plays a primary role in managing EVA's business operations. Other members of EVA Air's board manage support and service services of the company, including its catering and maintenance divisions. Related areas outside EVA Air's direct management include UNI Holidays, Evergreen's Evasión travel service and Evergreen Laurel Hotels.Bender, Andrew, Grundvig, Julie, and Kelly, Robert.

EVA Air is largely privately owned. Primary shareholders are Evergreen Marine Corporation (20%), Evergreen founder Chang Yung-fa (15%), and Evergreen International Corporation (11%). Foreign investors and individual stockholders combined hold 28% of EVA Air shares.  EVA Air has differentiated its onboard service by using Taiwanese (Hokkien), Mandarin, Hakka, English, and other languages for its in-flight cabin announcements. The order of Hokkien and Mandarin has varied since the carrier's launch. EVA Air has also used Taiwanese folk songs in its boarding music, including an orchestral form of "Longing for Spring Wind" performed by the Evergreen Group's Evergreen Symphony Orchestra. The carrier's aircraft and employee color scheme has at times been interpreted by observers as support for the Pan-Green Coalition of Taiwanese politics, mainly due to Evergreen founder Chang Yung-fa's political views in the 2000 presidential election, but this association changed following Chang's support of the Pan-Blue Coalition in the 2004 presidential election. The carrier has further abstained from displaying official markings of Taiwan on its aircraft, and received expedited approval of international landing rights as a result. The name "EVA" was taken from two letters of "Evergreen" and the first letter of "Airways." The name "EVA" is always spelled in capital letters. The airline uses the logo of its parent company, using green with an orange trim."Corporate Image." Eva Air. 1997-04-22. Retrieved on 2009-09-29. The standard EVA Air livery utilizes dark green, signifying durability, and orange, representing technological innovation. The tail globe logo is intended to represent stability and reliability, and its positioning on the tail, with one corner off the edge, represents service innovation. The EVA Air livery was updated in 2002, adding a larger typeface and the use of green covering the aircraft below the window line. The tail design and logo remained unchanged. Since 2003, EVA Air has adopted its current uniform, featuring dark green dresses with cropped jackets. Chief pursers are distinguished by orange highlights, gold bands, and orange stripes; flight attendants feature green trim and white stripes. The current uniform replaced the former green-and-orange necktie ensembles used in EVA Air's first twelve years. EVA Air has used different slogans throughout its operational history. The first slogan appeared on English advertising in the United States,EVA Air advertisements, Newsweek (1992), and National Geographic (1996) while the 1996 and 2003 versions were introduced internationally in both English and Mandarin. In 2005, a second "Sharing the world" slogan was introduced to complement the arrival of the airline's Boeing 777s. EVA Air slogans have been as follows:  Founded concurrently with the passenger operations of EVA Air, EVA Air Cargo operates facilities in Europe, Asia, and North America. Its cargo operations have diversified to include transportation of high-tech equipment and special care items such as museum artworkEVA air moves masterpieces from France to Taiwan exhibit. World Trade, 2002-01-01 and live zoological specimens. EVA Air has stated its goal of achieving a 50/50 split in revenues between its passenger and cargo operations. The airline's cargo operations are mainly operated via a fleet of Boeing 747-400, MD-11 dedicated freighters, Boeing 747-400 Combi aircraft, and additional belly cargo space on passenger aircraft. Following the establishment of its A330 fleet and the introduction of Boeing 777 long-haul aircraft, the airline converted some of its older Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft to freighters to meet cargo market demands. EVA Air Cargo established its European Cargo Center in Brussels in 2003EVA Air opens EVA Air Cargo Center Europe in Brussels. Air Transport World, 2003-10-01 and opened its Southern China Cargo Center in Hong Kong in 2006. As of 2007, EVA Air Cargo has 43 weekly cargo flights to London, Vienna, Brussels and US destinations including Los Angeles, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Chicago, Atlanta and New York. The carrier also has code-shares with international airlines including Air Nippon (a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways), British Airways World Cargo, Austrian Airlines and Lufthansa Cargo. In recent years, the airline has focused its North American cargo operations solely on point-to-point routes. By 2004, EVA Air Cargo ranked among the world's top 10 largest air freight companies. Industry publication Air Cargo World ranked EVA Air Cargo 6th out of 50 in its 2008 Air Cargo Excellence Survey, a measure of cargo service customer service and performance. In 2008, EVA Air handled the transport of two Chinese pandas, donated as a gift to the Taipei Zoo.   EVA Air service divisions further include pilot and cabin attendant training facilities, along with its Evergreen Sky Catering and Evergreen Airline Services ground support divisions. EVA Air has partnered with General Electric since 1998 to operate the Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation (EGAT), a heavy maintenance and aircraft overhaul service.The world's largest air freighter. (747 Large Cargo Freighter, Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corp.) Logistics Today, October 2006. Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation provides safety, repair, and refit services for EVA Air, other airlines' aircraft, and has handled the modification of four Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter aircraft for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner program. Eva Air's financial results are shown below:   Most EVA Air flights originate out of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, its main hub near Taipei, Taiwan. At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air's flight operations are concentrated in Terminal 2. Additionally, EVA Air and its domestic subsidiary UNI Air operate numerous flights out of Kaohsiung International Airport. A focus city for EVA Air outside Taiwan is Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, with westerly connections to all its European destinations except for Paris. Through the mid-2000s, EVA Air's route network was affected by the political status of Taiwan, which has historically limited access for Taiwanese airlines to Europe and certain Asian countries. Because Taiwanese carriers did not have direct access to China, EVA Air has used Hong Kong and Macau as interline destinations. EVA Air operated regular charter flights to China in 2008. The airline began regularly scheduled, direct cross-strait operations in December 2008, following the restoration of direct travel links. EVA air currently plans to expand its North America network. Houston route was open in June 2015, while Chicago route will be open around 2016. Washington Dulles is currently being evaluated, with it being rumored it will be opened in 2017. Rumors have also stated that the airline may commence flights to San Jose as well at an unconfirmed date. EVA currently plans to increase North American flights from 58 flights to 77 flights a week. EVA also plans to launch service to Delhi around late 2016 or early 2017. EVA air will be launching service to Istanbul and Cebu in 2016, along with the expansion of its service to Ho Chi Minh, Manila, Bangkok, Hanoi, Houston, New York JFK, Fukuoka, and Sapporo Chitose. EVA Air has existing codeshare agreements with over a dozen carriers, which include the following:Bangkok Airways inks code share deal with EVA Air  The EVA Air fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of January 2016):    In October 2005, EVA Air launched a campaign with Japanese company Sanrio to create the "Hello Kitty Jet," featuring the popular Japanese character. Using the airline's A330-200, the exterior adopted a livery of Hello Kitty characters. A year later, the airline launched a second Hello Kitty Jet. The aircraft featured a Hello Kitty motif on exterior and interior fittings and features. Both planes were used to serve Japanese destinations, and from mid–July 2007, also Taipei-Hong Kong routes. The original Hello Kitty livery was retired in 2009, but in 2011 EVA Air announced its return in redesigned form to mark the carrier's 20th anniversary and renew interest in Japanese tourism. For this occasion, EVA Air had ordered brand-new Airbus A330-300s to be painted in an all-new Hello Kitty livery. After the introduction of the "refreshed" Hello Kitty Livery on three EVA Air A330's, EVA Air decided to introduce two additional Hello Kitty A330 jets, launched in May and June 2012. The fourth and fifth Hello Kitty jets are known as "Hello Kitty Speed Puff" and "Hello Kitty Happy Music" respectively. In 2013, the carrier rolled out its sixth Hello Kitty jet "Hand in Hand", this time on a Boeing 777-300ER. The plane featured all the main characters from the Sanrio family. In 2015, the seventh and final Hello Kitty jet, Kikilala-themed "Shining Star" Boeing 777-300ER, rolled out.  In July 2006, EVA Air's third new Boeing 777-300ER was Boeing's center stage at the 2006 Farnborough Airshow in a static display. The aircraft, with its special 777-300ER "Rainbow" livery, was leased by Boeing for a week to be presented at the show. The first three EVA Air Boeing 777 aircraft featured this livery, which were repainted in 2013 (B-16701 in Star Alliance livery, B-16702 in regular livery, B-16703 in Hello Kitty "Hand in Hand" livery). For the 2010 Taipei International Flora Exposition, EVA Air debuted a floral-inspired design for its A330-200 aircraft, highlighting the carrier's official sponsorship of the event; the "Flora Expo cabin concept" introduced interior products such as in-flight meals with a flower motif. EVA Air's long-haul fleet is based on the Boeing 777-300ER, with the carrier's initial order for 15 all delivered by 2011. In 2006, the airline decided against its existing three Boeing 777-200LR orders (stating that with the 777-300ERs it has sufficient passenger capacity), and the 777-200LR orders were converted into 777-300ER orders.  In late 2010, EVA Air indicated it planned to lease three A330-300 aircraft for Asian routes in 2011. In mid-2011, EVA Air announced plans to acquire further 777-300ERs to complete the replacement of its 747-400 aircraft on Europe and U.S. routes, along with A321 series narrow-body jets to replace its MD-90 fleet. On 8 May 2012, EVA Air signed orders with Boeing for 3 additional 777-300ERs, and also announced its lease of 4 more 777-300ERs from GECAS.  Due to falling of freight demands, the airline restructured its cargo fleet by retiring the MD-11s. The last 747 combi flight was conducted on January 5, 2015 as BR868 from Hong Kong to Taipei, ending its 22-year service. After the release of Airbus A330neo, Eva air puts its A330 renewal plans on hold. Eva air also considers ordering more A321 (either the CEO variant or the NEO variant), and possibly order the 777Fs to replace the existing fleet of 747-400Fs and the already phased out MD-11Fs. The carrier plans to operate up to 100 aircraft. At the Paris Airshow 2015, Eva Air announced its Intention to purchase 5 777F and 4 A330-300. EVA Air confirmed the order of up to 24 Boeing 787-10 and two additional Boeing 777-300ER.They also announced the additional lease of 787 aircraft from ALC. EVA announced in late 2015 that it will be retiring all their A330-200 aircraft by the end of 2016, replacing them with the newly ordered A330-300. At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air has introduced the EVA Air Check-in Kiosks at T2, counters 6A, allowing passengers to check in and print their boarding passes electronically, since December 2009. The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles. Previously, if passengers were to check in for an EVA Air flight, they would have to go to an airline representative at the counters. EVA Air offers three classes of service on its long-haul flights: "Royal Laurel"/"Premium Laurel" (business), "Elite Class" (premium economy) and Economy Class. All cabins feature satellite phones, audio video on demand (AVOD) entertainment,Chandler, Jerry (2007-08-27). "More ‘Triple-Sevens’ do transpacific duties – EVA Air’s entry". Cheapflights.com.

Domestic and short-haul international services flown by EVA Air and UNI Air MD-90 aircraft also feature a short-haul business class. In the latter half of 2007, EVA Air's Boeing 747-400 fleet was upgraded to feature the airline's latest seating classes; the addition of Premium Laurel class on the Boeing 747-400 succeeded the previous "Super First" and "Super Business" cabins. In early 2012, EVA Air officials unveiled a redesigned "Royal Laurel" business class, including 180-degree, fully flat seats in reverse herringbone layout, which was first introduced on Boeing 777-300ER services in June 2012 between Taipei and New York. EVA Air currently has five classes, which are listed below.

As of 21 January 2014, EVA Air is ranked number 3 in safety after Qantas and Cathay Pacific out of more than 800 individual airlines by Aero International, a German monthly devoted to civil aviation.  At JACDEC Airline Safety Ranking 2015, EVA Air was ranked 3rd place (out of 60 major airlines). On May 30, 2012, EVA Air Cargo Flight BR661 (Boeing 747-400F) clipped the tail of American Eagle Flight 4265. The regional jet had arrived from Springfield, Mo., and was taxiing toward a gate at Terminal 3. The accident occurred around 1 p.m. CT. The incident occurred as the American Eagle jet was pulling into Gate G20. Damage to the two aircraft appeared to be minor and both returned to service after repair. On May 26, 2015, EVA Air flight BR12 (Boeing 777-300ER B-16718) from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to Los Angeles landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport at 15:40 (3:40 pm). It departed from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 18:57 (6:57 pm) Taiwan time with 305 passengers, 3 pilots and 15 flight attendants on board. Approximately 20 minutes before the flight landed, the FAA received a telephone call that the flight was the target of a security threat. As soon as the aircraft landed, authorities took it to a secure area in a cargo bay. FBI agents, the Los Angeles Police Bomb Squad and other officials continued their investigation. After a thorough investigation, the FBI, Los Angeles Police Department Bomb Squad and airport officials have confirmed that the security threat against EVA Air BR12 flight from Taipei to Los Angeles was a false alarm. Passengers began getting off of the aircraft for security screenings at 17:15 (5:15 pm PDT) and, now, authorities have released the Boeing 777-300ER back to EVA Air to resume operations. The aircraft was initially scheduled to operate as EVA flight BR11 scheduled to depart from Los Angeles to Taipei at 17:15 (5:15 pm PDT). EVA used another from a later flight to use on flight BR11 due to the time needed for though security checks. EVA BR11 was delayed by 2 hours 15 minutes and took off at 19:30 (7:30 pm PDT) with 298 passengers on board. On January 17, 2016, EVA Air flight BR11 (Boeing 777-300ER B-16719) from Los Angeles International Airport to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport made an emergency landing at CTS airport (Sapporo). The flight diverted due to a medical emergency onboard. The flight took off a hour later and arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 12:05 AM CST, almost 3 hours passed its scheduled arrival time 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Operating Revenue (NT$ Million) 102,192 107,110 110,747 116,921 - Net profit (NT$ Million) - Number of passengers carried (m) 7.5 8.0 8.9 10.0 Passenger load factor (%) 78 79.3 79.6 78.1 80.8 Cargo carried (000s tonnes) 793 741 713 680 622 Number of aircraft (at year end) 59 60 62 67 65 Number of employees (at year end) 5,807 6,429 7,077 7,750 References  Aircraft  In Service  Orders  Options  Passengers  Notes J K Y  Total Airbus A321-200 19 5 — 8 — 176 184 Operated by EVA Air and Uni Air.
