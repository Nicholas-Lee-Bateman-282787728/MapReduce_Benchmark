  Robert's Rules of Order is the short title of a book, written by Henry Martyn Robert, that is intended to be a guide for conducting meetings and making decisions as a group. Originally published in 1876, it has been revised regularly through the years, including two major revisions, by Robert and his successors based on feedback from users. The most recent version is the 11th Edition published in 2011 under the name Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (abbreviated RONR). This book has details on the types of groups that use it, the ways that decisions could be made, and the various situations in which decisions are made. Several resources, including an official concise guide and information on the official website, have been released by Robert's successors to help the many different organizations and groups that use the book.  The first edition of the book, whose full title was Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies, was published in February 1876 by then U.S. Army Major Henry Martyn Robert (1837–1923) with the short title Robert's Rules of Order placed on its cover. The procedures prescribed by the book were loosely modeled after those used in the United States House of Representatives, with such adaptations as Robert saw fit for use in ordinary societies. Although he was in the military, the rules in his book were not based on military rules. The author's interest in parliamentary procedure began in 1863 when he was chosen to preside over a church meeting and, although he accepted the task, felt that he did not have the necessary knowledge of proper procedure. In his later work as an active member of several organizations, Robert discovered that members from different areas of the country had very different views regarding what the proper parliamentary rules were, and these conflicting views hampered the organizations in their work. He eventually became convinced of the need for a new manual on the subject, one which would enable many organizations to adopt the same set of rules.  The following three tables list the official versions of the body of work known as "Robert's Rules of Order" developed by Henry M. Robert and maintained by his successors. The formal titles of the books appear above the editions they refer to (also see List of books with Robert's Rules in the title). Each successive edition was intended to supersede the previous editions. Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies (cover short title: Robert's Rules of Order) Robert's Rules of Order Revised Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised Henry M. Robert himself published the first four editions before his death in 1923, the last being the thoroughly revised and expanded Fourth Edition published as Robert's Rules of Order Revised in May 1915. By this time Robert had long been retired from the Army with the rank of brigadier general. The revisions were based on the feedback from hundreds of letters that Robert had received through the years. In addition, to explain the rules in Robert's Rules of Order Revised (abbreviated ROR), Robert published an introductory book for beginners titled Parliamentary Practice: An Introduction to Parliamentary Law in 1921 and a full book of explanations titled Parliamentary Law in 1923. Through a family trust, and later through the Robert's Rules Association (which is made up of descendants of Henry M. Robert), several subsequent editions of Robert's Rules of Order have been published, including another major revision of the work. The Seventh Edition, published in February 1970 on the 94th anniversary of the publication of the First Edition, was the first under the title Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR). The subsequent editions were based on additional feedback from users, including feedback received by electronic means in recent years. These later editions included material from Robert's Parliamentary Practice and Parliamentary Law. The current edition of the series became effective on September 23, 2011 under the title Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, Eleventh Edition. Announcement by Henry M. Robert, III, at the 2011 convention of the National Association of Parliamentarians®. This edition states that it: The authorship team of the current Eleventh Edition consists of a grandson of General Robert, an attorney, a lobbyist and legislative analyst, a mathematics professor, and a copy editor, all of them being experienced parliamentarians. More than five and a half million copies have been printed (which is a total of all editions). Henry M. Robert III, grandson of the original author and Trustee for the Robert's Rules Association, had acknowledged that "there has been controversy among parliamentarians concerning the length of Robert's Rules in its various editions and the complexity of the rules it describes." As a result, a supplemental book was developed. In 2005, a shorter reference guide, Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief (abbreviated RONRIB), was published by the same authorship team and publisher as the Tenth Edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR) and was made to be in accord with that edition of RONR.  A second edition of this shorter guide was published in 2011 to conform with the current Eleventh Edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised. The In Brief book is the only authorized concise guide for Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised and is intended as an introductory book for those unfamiliar with parliamentary procedure. The authors say, "In only twenty minutes, the average reader can learn the bare essentials, and with about an hour's reading can cover all the basics." It is meant to be an introductory supplement to the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised and is not suitable for adoption as a parliamentary authority in itself. Since the copyrights for several of the original editions (1915 or earlier) have expired, numerous other books and manuals have been published incorporating "Robert's Rules of Order" as part of their titles, with some of them based on those earlier editions (see List of books with Robert's Rules in the title). The existence of multiple editions and other variations, all published as "Robert's Rules of Order", can sometimes cause confusion, as the various publications may differ in some details. If an organization has adopted "Robert's Rules of Order", the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised is automatically its reference authority unless another version was adopted explicitly. The most recent edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (i.e. the 11th edition published in 2011) is the only current official version of the body of work known as "Robert's Rules of Order". Generally, Robert's Rules of Order is a guide for conducting meetings and making decisions as a group. The purpose of the book is "to enable assemblies of any size, with due regard for every member's opinion, to arrive at the general will on the maximum number of questions of varying complexity in a minimum amount of time and under all kinds of internal climate ranging from total harmony to hardened or impassioned division of opinion." The book is designed for use in ordinary societies rather than legislative assemblies, and it is the most commonly adopted parliamentary authority among societies in the United States. It is also recognized as "the most widely used reference for meeting procedure and business rules in the English-speaking world." The book states that it is "a codification of the present-day general parliamentary law". "General parliamentary law" refers to the common rules and customs for conducting business in organizations and assemblies. It does not refer to statutory legal requirements nor to common-law precedent derived from court judgments. In other words, the book is about procedures for meetings and not about what is "legal" (i.e. it is not a law book). As a reference, it is designed to answer, as nearly as possible, any question of parliamentary procedure that may arise. The Eleventh Edition contains 669 pages of text, and all of its original content was included because it "has at some time come up as a question of procedure somewhere". The completeness of the book was made so that organizations would not have to write extensive rules for themselves. In addition, members of different organizations could refer to the same book of rules. If an assembly or society has adopted a book of rules (such as Robert's Rules of Order) for conducting its meetings, it is still free to adopt its own rules which supersede any rules in the adopted book with which they conflict. The only limitations might come from the rules in a parent organization or from national, state, or local law. Otherwise, the rules in the book are binding on the society. If an assembly has not formally adopted a particular manual as its parliamentary authority, the provisions of any manual can be cited as "persuasive" in such a situation.: "Although it is unwise for an assembly or a society to attempt to function without formally adopted rules of order, a recognized parliamentary manual may be cited under such conditions as persuasive." The contents of the current (11th) edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), published in 2011, include details on the types of groups that use the book, the ways that decisions could be made, and the various situations in which decisions are made. The Introduction in the book provides a history of parliamentary procedure and includes the background and history of Robert's Rules of Order. Rules in the book are based on the rights of the majority, of the minority (especially a strong minority that is greater than one third), of individual members, of absentees, and of all these together. Some fundamental principles upon which the book is based include: one question at a time; one person, one vote; and a vote being limited to members present. A group that uses the book is called a deliberative assembly. The types of deliberative assemblies are a mass meeting, a local assembly of an organized society (local club or local branch), a convention, a legislative body, and a board. An organization may have rules which could include a corporate charter, a constitution or bylaws, rules of order (special rules of order and parliamentary authority), standing rules, and customs. To conduct business, groups have meetings or sessions that may be separated by more than or be within a quarterly time interval. The types of meetings are a regular meeting, a special meeting, an adjourned meeting, an annual meeting, an executive session, a public session, and electronic meetings. A member of a deliberative assembly has the right to attend meetings, make motions, speak in debate, and vote. The process of making a decision is done through a motion, which is a proposal to do something. The formal steps in handling a motion are the making of a motion, having a second, stating the motion, having debate on the motion, putting the motion to a vote, and announcing the results of the vote. Action could be taken informally without going through these steps by using unanimous consent. When making a choice, the basic principle of decision is majority vote. In situations when more than majority vote is required, the requirement could include a two-thirds vote, previous notice, or a vote of a majority of the entire membership. The book provides details about main motions including the motion to [[Ratification|ratify]]. In addition, the book [[list of motions|lists]] other motions and provides details (including explanations, forms, and examples) on these motions which include:  * [[Subsidiary motion|Subsidiary Motions]] - [[Postpone indefinitely|Postpone Indefinitely]], [[Amend (motion)|Amend]], [[Commit (motion)|Commit or Refer]], [[Postpone to a certain time|Postpone to a Certain Time]], [[Limit or extend limits of debate|Limit or Extend Limits of Debate]], [[Previous question|Previous Question]], and [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|Lay on the Table]] * [[Privileged motion|Privileged Motions]] - [[Call for the orders of the day|Call for the Orders of the Day]], [[Raise a question of privilege|Raise a Question of Privilege]], [[Recess (motion)|Recess]], [[Adjournment|Adjourn]], and [[Adjournment|Fix the Time to Which to Adjourn]] * [[Incidental motion|Incidental Motions]] - [[Point of order|Point of Order]], [[Appeal (motion)|Appeal]], [[Suspension of the rules|Suspend the Rules]], [[Objection to the consideration of a question|Objection to the Consideration of a Question]], [[Division of a question|Division of a Question]], [[Consideration by paragraph or seriatim|Consideration by Paragraph or Seriatim]], [[Motions relating to methods of voting and the polls|Motions Relating to Methods of Voting and the Polls]], [[Motions relating to nominations|Motions Relating to Nominations]], [[Request to be excused from a duty|Request to Be Excused from a Duty]], and [[Requests and inquiries|Requests and Inquiries]] ([[Parliamentary inquiry|Parliamentary Inquiry]], [[Request for information (parliamentary procedure)|Request for Information]], [[Request for permission to withdraw or modify a motion|Request for Permission (or Leave) to Withdraw or Modify a Motion]], [[Request to read papers|Request to Read Papers]], and [[Request for any other privilege|Request for Any Other Privilege]]) * [[Motion that brings a question again before the assembly|Motions That Bring A Question Again Before An Assembly]] - [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|Take from the Table]], [[Repeal|Rescind/Amend Something Previously Adopted]], [[Discharge a committee|Discharge a Committee]], and [[Reconsideration of a motion|Reconsider]] Details for each motion include its purpose, when it could be made, if it is debatable, if it is amendable, the vote required for adoption, and if it could be reconsidered. The "order of precedence", or rank, of the motions is also described in detail.  === Various topics === The second half of the book covers various topics in detail. Brief summaries of these topics are as follows:  Depending on the situation, motions could be [[Renewal (parliamentary procedure)|renewed]], or made again. On the other hand, members should not use legitimate motions for [[Dilatory motions and tactics|dilatory]] and improper purposes to waste time.  A [[quorum]], or minimum number of members, is required to be present at a meeting in order to validly conduct business. The business that is to come up in a meeting could be listed in an [[order of business]] or an [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]].  Each member could get a chance to speak through [[Recognition (parliamentary procedure)|assignment of the floor]] and [[Debate (parliamentary procedure)|debate]]. Debate may be limited in the number of speeches and time and should be respectful to others at all times. Voting takes place to decide the course of action and it could be done in a multitude of ways, such as [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|voice vote, standing vote, and ballot vote]].  Officers in an organization could be elected through the process of [[nomination]]s and [[election]]s. Each organization decides for itself which officers to have, but the minimum officers in a deliberative assembly are a presiding officer (usually "[[President (corporate title)|president]]" or "[[chairman]]") and a [[secretary]]. The secretary keeps the [[minutes]], or the official records of the proceedings, for each meeting. As part of their duties, the officers may have reports to give, such as a financial report given by the [[treasurer]]. In addition, an organization may have a [[Board of directors|board]] to handle business on behalf of the organization. Officers and boards only have such authority and powers that are given to them in the governing documents of the organization. There may also be [[committee]]s that are formed to assist the organization. The boards and committees may have reports to give as well.  People may gather in [[mass meeting]]s for a specific purpose or cause. One such purpose of the mass meetings could be for the intent of organizing a permanent society.  Each organization has its basic rules contained in its [[By-law|bylaws]]. The bylaws could describe the name of the organization and its purpose, the requirements to be a member or an officer, how meetings are scheduled, if there are boards or committees (or both), its [[parliamentary authority]], and how to amend the bylaws.  Representatives from constituent groups may gather as [[delegate]]s in [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]] to conduct business on behalf of the organization. Conventions may consist of several meetings and may last for several days or more on an annual basis or other such infrequent interval.  If members do not act according to the organization's rules, they could be subject to [[disciplinary procedures]]. Such action could range from [[censure]] to the extreme of expulsion from the organization. Officers could be disciplined by removal from office.  === Charts, tables, and lists === The tinted pages (pages marked by a gray band along the outer edge) in the rear of the book contain the following charts, tables, and lists: (1) Chart for Determining When Each Subsidiary or Privileged Motion Is In Order, (2) Table of Rules Relating to Motions, (3) Sample Forms Used in Making Motions, (4) and (5) Motions and Parliamentary Steps, (6) Motions Which Require a Two-Thirds Vote, (7) Motions Whose Reconsideration Is Prohibited Or Limited, and (8) Table of Rules for Counting Election Ballots.<ref>{{Harvnb|Robert|2011|pp = xxi-xxii}}</ref>  == Additional information related to current edition == In addition to containing a summary of basic points from the current (11th) edition of ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' (RONR), the following contents are unique to the current (2nd) edition of ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief'' (RONRIB)'':'' an example of an agenda, additional sample dialogues, frequently asked questions, an example of a call of a meeting, an example of a memorandum listing the [[order of business]], and the following tables: (A) Handling Motions as Chair, (B) When Chair Stands and Sits, (C) Conducting a Meeting as Chair, (D) Table of Rules Relating to Motions, and (E) Words to Use as a Member.<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = vii|edition = 2nd|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  The Robert's Rules Association has also made the Eleventh Edition available in CD-ROM format (designed for installation on Windows PCs) through American Legal Publishing.

Such a rule is not allowed unless the organization specifically provides for it in its bylaws.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 429}}</ref>  === Other parliamentary authorities === Parliamentarians have estimated that about 85 to 95 percent of organizations in the United States use ''Robert's Rules of Order''.<ref name=":13" /><ref name=":14" /><ref>{{Cite book|title = Notes and Comments on Robert's Rules|last = Slaughter|first = Jim|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-8093-3215-1|location = Carbondale and Edwardsville|pages = 160|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5THFbCnDdbIC&pg=PA160|last2 = Ragsdale|first2 = Gaut|last3 = Ericson|first3 = Jon L.|edition = Fourth}}</ref> The remaining percentage of organizations use other books on meeting procedures. Notable examples of such books include ''[[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]]'', ''[[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure]]'', and ''[[Riddick's Rules of Procedure]]'' (also see [[parliamentary authority]]).<ref name=":13" /> These books along with ''Robert's Rules of Order'' share the general idea of rule of the majority with respect for the minority. A difference may be a "simplification" of the rules. Henry M. Robert III responded to the simplification by saying the following:<ref name=":3" />  {{Quote|text = In an effort to make parliamentary procedure more widely accessible, known, and employed, the approach of “simplification” unfortunately resurrects the very problem that Robert's Rules first emerged to solve. When there are large gaps in the rules, one or more of three major problems occur: much time is spent in debating what the rules are or should be, the chair unilaterally imposes a result, or the majority imposes a result that frequently disregards the rights of the minority. When virtually everyone agrees, an assembly may be able to get by without resort to elaborate rules. When there is serious division, however, it is in human nature that each side will attempt to construe any ambiguity in the rules in such a way as to foster its substantive objectives. The ideal is that the rules applicable to a contentious subject are so clear that the contending sides cannot plausibly differently interpret them to their own advantage. Only then does parliamentary law fully play its role as the neutral arbiter that channels disputes into productive debate over substance, instead of time-wasting and manipulative maneuvering over procedure.|sign = |source = }}Also in response to the simplification was the publication of a supplemental guide to the official book (see [[Robert's Rules of Order#"In Brief" version|"In Brief" version]]).  === Consensus decision-making === In modern parliamentary procedure, the usual practice is having a proposal first, then discussion on this proposal with any modifications to it, and finally a vote on it, with majority vote deciding the issue if there are any disagreements. An alternative to this process is [[consensus decision-making]]. In this alternative, discussion of potential proposals is held first, followed by the framing of a proposal, and then modifying it until the group reaches a consensus, when there is no longer any disagreement.  As a response to this alternative, the authors of ''Robert's Rules of Order'' stated their belief in using debate and majority vote as part of the process in making decisions for the group.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = l}}: "Robert saw, on the other hand, that the evolution of majority vote in tandem with lucid and clarifying debate—resulting in a decision representing the view of the deliberate majority—far more clearly ferrets out and demonstrates the will of an assembly."</ref>  == References ==  === Primary Sources === {{Refbegin}} *{{cite book|first=Henry M. |last=Robert|authorlink=Henry Martyn Robert|title=Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|edition= 11th |publisher=Da Capo Press|location= Philadelphia, PA|date= 2011|ref= harv |display-authors=etal}} ISBN 978-0-306-82021-2 (hardcover), ISBN 978-0-306-82020-5 (paperback), ISBN 978-0-306-82022-9 (leatherbound) *{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com|title = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site (Home)|date =2011 |accessdate = |website =The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site |publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.}} {{Refend}}  === Citations === {{Reflist|2}}  ==External links== {{Wikisource}} * [http://www.robertsrules.com/ The Official Robert's Rules Of Order Web Site (robertsrules.com)] Site maintained by the Robert's Rules Association  === Preview (limited pages) of current editions === * Preview ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' (RONR, 11th ed., 2011) through [https://books.google.com/books?id=O8zExFMa0SkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Google Books] * Preview ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief'' (RONRIB, 2nd ed., 2011) through [https://books.google.com/books?id=mPD0eDQ6ZOAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Google Books]  ===Sites providing full text of older editions (from public domain)=== The following sites are not maintained by the Robert's Rules Association and have no relation to the Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site: * [http://www.robertsrules.org/rror--00.htm robertsrules.org] Full text of 1915 (4th) ed.
