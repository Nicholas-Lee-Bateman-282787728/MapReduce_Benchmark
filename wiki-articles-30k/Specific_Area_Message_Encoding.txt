 Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) is the protocol used to encode the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) in the U.S. and Weatheradio Canada in Canada. It is also used to set off receivers in Mexico City and surrounding areas as part of Mexico's Seismic Alert System (SASMEX) and Seismic Alert Radio System (SARMEX). From the 1960s to the 1980s, a special feature of the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) system was the transmission of a single 1050&nbsp;Hz attention tone prior to the broadcast of any message alerting the general public of significant weather events. This became known as the Warning Alarm Tone (WAT). Although it served NWR well, there were many drawbacks. Without staff at media facilities to manually evaluate the need to rebroadcast an NWR message using the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS), automatic rebroadcasting of all messages preceded by just the WAT was unacceptable and impractical. Even if stations and others with the need were willing to allow for this type of automatic capture, assuming the events for activation were critical, there was no way for automated equipment at the station to know when the message was complete and restore it back to normal operation. SAME had its beginnings in the early 1980s when NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) began experimenting with system using analog tones in a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) format to transmit data with radio broadcasts. In 1985, the NWS forecast offices began experimenting with placing special digital codes at the beginning and end of every message concerning life- or property-threatening weather conditions targeting a specific area. The intent of what became SAME was to ultimately transmit a code with the initial broadcast of all NWR messages.  The NWS started implementing SAME on the full NWR system in 1998. In 2003, NOAA established a SAME technology standard for weather radio receivers. However, the roll-out moved slowly until 1995, when the U.S. Government provided the budget needed to develop the SAME technology across the entire radio network.  Nationwide implementation occurred in 1997, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the SAME standard as part of its new Emergency Alert System (EAS). The SAME technique was later adopted by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1997NOAA Weather Radio - Watches, Warnings and Tones/Alarms&nbsp;– National Weather Service in Philadelphia/Mount Holly (accessed October 1, 2009) for use in the EAS as well as by Environment Canada [ ]&nbsp;– The Green Lane: (Backgrounder)&nbsp;– Weatheradio Network (accessed Dec. 5, 2011) for its Weatheradio Canada service in 2004. Much like the original EBS dual-tone , this produces a distinct sound (the ) which is easily recognized by most individuals due to its use in weekly and monthly broadcast tests, as well as weather alert messages. During the said events, viewers and/or listeners will hear these digital codes in the form of buzzes, chirps, & clicking sounds (or what broadcast engineers affectionately call "duck farts")http://www.wsab.org/eas/eas_meeting_minutes_jan06.html just before the attention signal is sent out and at the conclusion of the voice message.WRSAME&nbsp;– Weather Radio Specific Area Message Encoder&nbsp;– Metro Skywarn (accessed August 20, 2009) In the SAME system, messages are constructed in four parts, the first and last of which are digital and the middle two are audio. The digital sections of a SAME message are AFSK data burst, with each individual bit lasting 1920&nbsp;μs (1.92&nbsp;ms) each, giving a bit rate of 520&nbsp;bits per second.  A mark bit is four complete cycles of a sine wave, translating to a mark frequency of 2083&nbsp;Hz, and a space bit is three complete sine wave cycles, making the space frequency 1562.5&nbsp;Hz. The data is encoded in 7-bit ASCII but uses all 8-bits, with no parity bit and no stop bit ("8-N-0"). The least-significant bit of each byte is transmitted first, including the preamble. Since there is no error correction, the digital part of a SAME message is transmitted three times, so that decoders can pick "best two out of three" for each byte, thereby eliminating most errors which can cause an activation to fail. However, consumer weather radio receivers often activate (unmute the audio) after hearing only one out of the three headers (with a significant delay). The text of the header code is a fixed format: ZCZC-ORG-EEE-PSSCCC+TTTT-JJJHHMM-LLLLLLLL-  This is broken down as follows:  1.  A preamble of binary 10101011 (0xAB in hex) repeated sixteen times, used for "receiver calibration" (i.e., [[Synchronization in telecommunications|clock synchronization]]), then the letters <code>ZCZC</code> as an attention to the decoder (a message activation method inherited from [[Navtex|NAVTEX]]).  2.  ''ORG'' — Originator code; programmed per unit when put into operation<ref>47CFR11.31(d)</ref>  *PEP – Primary Entry Point Station **President or other authorized national officials *CIV – Civil authorities **i.e. Governor, state/local emergency management, local police/fire officials *WXR – [[National Weather Service]] (or [[Environment Canada]].) **Any weather-related alert * EAS – EAS Participant ** Broadcasters. Generally only used with test messages. * EAN – Emergency Action Notification Network ** Used to send Emergency Action Notifications.  3.  ''EEE'' — Event code; programmed at time of event  4.  ''PSSCCC'' — Location codes (up to 31 location codes per message), each beginning with a dash character; programmed at time of event  *In the United States, the first digit (''P'') is zero if the entire county or area is included in the warning, otherwise, it is a non-zero number depending on the location of the emergency.<ref>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title47-vol1/xml/CFR-2010-title47-vol1-sec11-31.xml</ref> *In the United States, the remaining five digits are the [[FIPS state code]] (''SS'') and [[FIPS county code]] (''CCC''). The entire state may be specified by using county number 000 (''three zeros''). *In Canada, all six digits specify the Canadian Location Code, which corresponds to a specific [[forecast region]] as used by the [[Meteorological Service of Canada]]. All forecast region numbers are six digits with the first digit always zero.  5.  ''TTTT'' — Purge time of the alert event (from exact time of issue)  *In the format ''hhmm'', using 15 minute increments up to one hour, using 30 minute increments up to six hours, and using hourly increments beyond six hours.  Weekly and monthly tests sometimes have a 12 hour or greater purge time to assure users have an ample opportunity to verify reception of the test event messages; however; 15 minutes is more common, especially on NOAA Weather Radio's tests. *For short term events (like a tornado) this value could be set to 0000 (''four zeros''), which will purge the warning immediately after the message has been received.  However, this is not typical, and FCC guidelines suggest a minimum of 15 minutes purge time. *'''The purge time is not intended to coincide with the actual end of the event'''.  Longer events that may not end for days (like hurricanes) may have a purge time of only a few hours.  That an event message has been purged does not indicate or imply that the threat has passed.  6.  ''JJJHHMM'' — Exact time of issue, in [[UTC]], (''without [[time zone]] adjustments'').  *''JJJ'' is the [[Ordinal date]] (''day'') of the year, with leading zeros *''HHMM'' is the hours and minutes (24-hour format), in [[UTC]], with leading zeros  7.  ''LLLLLLLL'' — Eight-character station callsign identification, with "/" used instead of&nbsp;"–" (such as the first eight letters of a cable headend's location, <code>WABC/FM</code> for [[WABC-FM]], or <code>KLOX/NWS</code> for a [[NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards|weather radio]] station programmed from Los Angeles).  Each field of the header code is terminated by a dash character, including the station ID at the end; individual ''PSCCC'' location numbers are also separated by dashes, with a plus (+) separating the last location from the purge time that follows it.  ==Full message format== An EAS message contains these elements, in this transmitted sequence:  #'''Header.''' #'''Attention signal''' — Sent if any message is included (normally sent with all messages except RWT on broadcast radio/TV); must be at least eight seconds long.  (On Weatheradio in Canada the 1050&nbsp;Hz tone is only used with three event codes: RMT, SVR & TOR.) #*Single {{Audio|1050Hz Tone.ogg|1050 Hz}} audio tone for Weatheradio. #*Combined {{Audio|Emergency Alert System Attention Signal 20s.ogg|853 and 960 Hz}} tones for broadcast radio/TV. #'''Message''' — Audio, video image or video text. #'''Tail''' — (Preamble) <code>NNNN</code> (EOM).  There is one second of blank audio between each section, and before and after each message. For those used to packet communications systems where each packet has a checksum, note that there is no checksum used in the message format. Each message is supposed to be transmitted 3 times, and the receiver is obliged to implement columnar parity correction.  The combined tones date back to 1976{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} when they were made part of the [[Emergency Broadcast System]], the EAS' predecessor.  ==Event codes== There are roughly 80 different event codes that are used in EAS. These codes are defined federally by the FCC for use in the EAS system and publicly by the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] (CEA) standard<ref name="CEA">Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) Technology Standard [http://www.ce.org/Standards/Standard-Listings/R3-Audio-Systems/CEA-2009-B-(ANSI).aspx "CEA-2009-B (ANSI)"], November 2010, accessed January 11, 2014.</ref> for SAME protocol weather radio receiver decoder units.  All but the first six of these used to be optional and could be programmed into encoder/decoder units at the request of the broadcaster. However, a July 12, 2007 memo by the FCC now requires mandatory participation in state and local level EAS by broadcasters. Furthermore, the creation and evolution of a voluntary standard by the CEA in December 2003 has provided participating manufacturers of weather radio receivers a single definitive reference to use when designing and programming receivers. In addition, some receiver manufacturers have added an additional layer as to whether or not an event code can be user-suppressed (e.g., a Hurricane Warning in a Midwest US State) or will never be allowed to be suppressed (e.g., nuclear power plant warning).  :'''Key for event code tables''' :{| class="wikitable" ! colspan=2 | USA type key ! colspan=2 | CAN/MEX type key ! colspan=2 | Event level key |- | M || Mandatory code | AB || Administrative bulletin | style="background-color: #90FF90;" | ADV || Advisory |- | O1 || Original optional code | CI || Currently implemented | style="background-color: #FFFF90;" | WCH || Watch |- | O2 || 2002 optional code<ref name="FCC">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-02-64A1.pdf</ref><ref>http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=75127c72007aa6a3f1ce8fda8cb814e2&rgn=div5&view=text&node=47:1.0.1.1.11&idno=47#47:1.0.1.1.11.2.239.1</ref> | RT || Required test | style="background-color: #FF9090;" | WRN || Warning |- | NI || Not implemented | FI || For future implementation | style="background-color: white;" | TEST || Test |- |    || | TS || Testing for Implementation | || |}  :'''Event codes in use:'''  :The following event codes have been implemented by agencies in the United States and/or Canada, and CIRES A.C. in Mexico.  :{| class="wikitable sortable" border="1" cellpadding="2" style="text-align: center" ! scope="col" width="40" | Event Code ! scope="col" width="40" | U.S. Type ! scope="col" width="40" | CAN.

On a more specialized receiver, a user has the option to eliminate any SAME alert codes that may not apply to their area such as a "[[Special marine warning|Special Marine Warning]]" or a "[[Coastal flood warning|Coastal Flood Warning]]". Once the SAME header is sent by NOAA/NWS and if it matches the desired code(s), the receivers then decode the event, scroll it on their display screens, and sound an alarm.  Receivers receive on one of the following National Weather Service network frequencies (in MHz): 162.400, 162.425, 162.450, 162.475, 162.500, 162.525, and 162.550.  The signals are typically receivable up to 50 miles from the transmitters.<ref>''NWR Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME)'', http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/nwrsame.htm</ref>  ==SAME in popular culture==  {{Original research|section|date=April 2015}}  *The SAME EOM (end of message) tone was heard in the [[movie trailer]] for ''[[Knowing (movie)|Knowing]]'' and in the series ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'' where its familiar emergency use and its increasing [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] create a sense of [[foreshadowing|foreboding]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2330985241/ ''Knowing'' Movie Trailer #2]&nbsp;– ''[[Internet Movie Database]]'' (accessed July 8, 2009)</ref> It was used in the movie trailer for ''[[Olympus Has Fallen]]'' and ''[[The Purge (film series)|The Purge]]''.  ==See also== *[[Common Alerting Protocol]] (CAP)&nbsp;– A SAME-compatible digital format for multi-system warning coordination.  ==Notes== {{notelist-ua}}  ==References== {{reflist|30em}}  *{{Citation  |last= National Weather Service  |title= NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) All Hazards Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME)  |url= http://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/sym/pd01017012curr.pdf  |publisher= National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration  |series= National Weather Service Instruction  |volume= 10-1712  |date= February 12, 2007  |doi=}}  ==External links== *[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/info/nwrsame.html NOAA Weatheradio SAME page] *[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/Maps/ NOAA Weatherradio SAME coverage maps] *[http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=919D7DE9-1 Environment Canada SAME page] *[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=208b070ea2092734ded791d18197a4dc;rgn=div5;view=text;node=47%3A1.0.1.1.11;idno=47;cc=ecfr Title 47, Sec. 11.31 et seq., Code of Federal Regulations, EAS Protocol (implementing SAME)]  [[Category:Encodings]] [[Category:Emergency Alert System]] [[Category:NOAA Weather Radio]]
