   Robert Laurence "Bob" Barr, Jr. (born November 5, 1948) is  a  former federal prosecutor and a former member of the United States House of Representatives.    He represented Georgia's 7th congressional district as a Republican from 1995 to 2003. Barr attained national prominence as one of the leaders of the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Barr joined the Libertarian Party in 2006  and served on its National Committee. He was the Libertarian Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election. Barr was born on November 5, 1948, in Iowa City, Iowa, to Bob and Beatrice Barr.   His father, a West Point soldier, moved the family to various locations around the world while pursuing his career in civil engineering.  The second of six children, Bob Jr. spent his boyhood in Malaysia, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Baghdad, and finally Tehran, Iran, where he graduated from Community High School in 1966. Barr returned to the United States, attending the University of Southern California and joining the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity in 1967. He held the position of Grand Prytanis on the fraternity's Grand Council from 2013 to 2015. During this time, Barr's mother introduced him to the work of Ayn Rand.  This fostered a new-found appreciation for conservatism and prompted Barr to join the Young Trojan Republican Club.  Barr completed his B.A., cum laude, from University of Southern California in 1970.  Barr married his first wife while still in college.  They divorced in 1976. Barr earned a master's degree in International Affairs  from George Washington University in 1972, and his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center (attending at night) in 1977. From 1971 (1970?) to 1978, Barr was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as an analyst of Latin American issues.  Barr married his second wife, Gail, in 1976.  They have two children together, both boys, born in 1980  Gail Barr's 1999 afffidavit states their eldest son was three years old in March 1983, implying a birthday range of about April 1979 to March 1980. Bob Barr states their eldest son is 18 years old during his January 1999 Larry King Live interview, which implies a birthday range of February 1980 to January 1981. The overlap between these two statements suggests the eldest was born in either February or March 1980. and 1981. Gail and Bob Barr divorced in 1986. After leaving the CIA, Barr moved to Georgia, where he practiced law and became active in the Republican Party, serving as county chair. Barr made an unsuccessful bid for the Georgia House of Representatives in 1984.  In 1986 Barr married his third wife, Jerilyn Dobbins, who was later known as Jeri Barr.   Bob Barr's web site stated in 2008 that Jeri and he have four children and six grandchildren.  It's unclear which, if any, of these children are issue from their marriage. In 1986, Barr was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia – a post Barr held until 1990.  Barr's office prosecuted state and local officials, members of the Medellin drug cartel, and got a perjury indictment on then-sitting Republican Congressman Pat Swindall,Congressman Barr lowers the boom Insight on the News who ultimately served a year in prison on the charges. From 1990 to 1991, Barr was president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, an Atlanta-based law firm and policy center that litigates in support of "limited government, individual economic freedom, and the free enterprise system".   Barr sought the Republican Party nomination for U.S. Senate in 1992, but lost the primary election to Paul Coverdell.  The primary was very close, with Barr losing by fewer than 1,600 votes in a runoff election.  Subsequently, Coverdell came in behind incumbent Senator Wyche Fowler in the general election, but the 3% showing by a Libertarian candidate (Jim Hudson) forced a runoff, which Coverdell won. Barr was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 as a Republican, upsetting six-term Democrat Buddy Darden, to represent Georgia's 7th congressional district in the 104th United States Congress. Barr was one of 73 Republican freshmen ushered into Congress in that election.  The election became known as the "Republican Revolution" because it resulted in the first Republican House majority in 40 years – since the 1955 adjournment of the 83rd Congress. Barr was later re-elected three times, serving from 1995 to 2003.  While in Congress, Barr served as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, as Vice-Chairman of the Government Reform Committee, and as a member of the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Veteran's Affairs. In Congress, Barr became famous for his "dour" image and told constituents, "You don't send me to Washington to smile." He also said in a radio interview "If it's not in the Constitution, I won't smile".Interview on WAYY Radio, Wisconsin He later explained "I don't consider politicians who smile to be worth a heck of a lot... all things considered, it doesn't make a dime's worth of difference if the politicians in Washington smile or not, what matters is how much of your hard-earned dollars they take to spend in pure pork".Interview on WGST radio, Atlanta, Georgia. Barr said in 2010 "I can see a situation where the federal government is going to bring an entire suitcase of San Francisco values to the American family, and while I would love to explain all the things that are wrong with that, the fact is that this is a corrupting, left-leaning, influence on a section of society that so many liberal elites want to see taken out of the 'red state' column. The only solution to this kind of behavior is dour and austere social conservatism, like my own". Adding to his image, Barr has frequently protested about "cult hairstyles", saying "I cannot abide by people who adopt a cult hairstyle, or persistently dress inappropriately for meetings with me".WSB 750AM Radio, Georgia Georgia's congressional districts were reorganized by the Democratic-controlled Georgia legislature ahead of the 2002 elections for the 108th Congress.  As part of the legislature's effort to get more Democrats elected from the state, Barr's district was dismantled even though Georgia gained two districts. He was drawn into the same district as fellow Republican John Linder. The new district was numerically Barr's district – the 7th – but contained most of the territory from Linder's old 11th District.  This move profited Democrats by leading to the inevitable defeat of an incumbent Republican (i.e., either Barr or Linder).  Recognizing Barr's precarious situation, the Libertarian Party seized on the opportunity to oust one of the federal drug war's most vocal proponents (Barr), and ran TV ads criticizing Barr's opposition to medical marijuana during the Republican primaries. Barr was soundly defeated by a 2-to-1 margin.  The extent to which the issue of medical marijuana shaped the election is unclear. Some have argued that Barr's huge loss simply reflected the nature of the new 7th district, which was primarily redrawn from Linder's old 11th district.  However, before the medical marijuana ads were aired, the Linder campaign acknowledged the race as being tight; and Pat Gartland, southeastern director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, saw the race as "too close to call". Barr's defeat was applauded by many Democrats and Libertarians. Rob Kampia of the Marijuana Policy Project called it "glorious news". Ron Crickenberger, producer of the TV ads, was quick to warn other supporters of the War on Drugs:  However, some individuals within these groups lamented Barr's defeat as a setback for privacy rights and libertarian causes in general.  Libertarian J. Bradley Jansen opined:   During his tenure, Barr was regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress. In 2002, he was described by Bill Shipp in an OnlineAthens.com article as "the idol of the gun-toting, abortion-fighting, IRS-hating hard right wing of American politics". However, Barr's criticism of the Bush administration's policies on privacy and other civil liberties after the 9/11 attacks was unusual among House Republicans (see Criticism of Bush Administration below). This criticism earned Barr other labels such as "Maverick", "Jekyll-and-Hyde", and "Libertarian". Barr was originally a strong supporter of the War on Drugs, reflecting his previous experience as an Anti-Drug Coordinator for the United States Department of Justice. While in Congress, he was a member of the Speaker's Task Force for a Drug-Free America. This task force was established in 1998 by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich to "design a World War II-style victory plan to save America's children from illegal drugs." The task force crafted legislation specifically designed to "win the War on Drugs by 2002". Barr advocated complete federal prohibition of medical marijuana. In 1998, he successfully blocked implementation of Initiative 59&nbsp;– the "Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998"&nbsp;– which would have legalized medical marijuana in Washington, D.C. The "Barr Amendment" to the 1999 Omnibus spending bill not only blocked implementation of Initiative 59, but also prohibited the vote tally from even being released. Nearly a year passed before a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union eventually revealed the initiative had received 69 percent of the vote. In response to the judge's ruling, Barr simply attached another "Barr Amendment" to the 2000 Omnibus spending bill that overturned Initiative 59 outright. The Barr Amendment also prohibited future laws that would "decrease the penalties for marijuana or other Schedule I drugs" in Washington, D.C. This preemptively blocked future attempts by Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) to reform marijuana laws in DC via the initiative process. In March 2002, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan struck down this portion of the Barr Amendment as being an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. Barr's response to the ruling was defiant:  The federal government later prevailed on appeal, reinstating the Barr Amendment just in time to thwart MPP's initiative 63 – "The Medical Marijuana Initiative of 2002" – which had already qualified for the November 2002 ballot. In 2009, both the United States Senate and House of Representatives voted to lift the ban against a medical marijuana initiative, effectively overturning the Barr Amendment. Barr would later reverse his position on medical marijuana, joining MPP as a lobbyist five years later. In a June 4, 2008, interview with Stephen Colbert on the Colbert Report, Barr confirmed that he now supports ending marijuana prohibition, as well as the War on Drugs for which he once vehemently fought. In 2009, he was hired by the MPP to lobby to successfully overturn the amendment that he authored. Barr took a lead in legislative debate concerning same-sex marriage. He authored and sponsored the Defense of Marriage Act, a law enacted in 1996 which states that only marriages that are between a man and a woman can be federally recognized, and individual states may choose not to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state.The Defense of Marriage Act PBS At the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, he apologized for the part of the Defense of Marriage Act which prevents the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages.Bob Barr Nomination Speech, May 25, 2008, Libertarian National Convention, Denver, Colorado. He now supports same-sex marriage, opposes the Federal Marriage Amendment, contending it is a violation of states' rights, and supports the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. He voted for the first USA PATRIOT Act,Testimony of Bob Barr on Senate Judiciary Committee, September 22, 2004 but only after his amendments adding "sunset clauses" were added to the final bill. Barr played a similar role during the debate over Bill Clinton's Comprehensive Anti-terrorism Act of 1995, crafting pro-civil liberties amendments to the original text.Congressional Record He now publicly regrets his Patriot Act vote. In 2002 Barr voted for the Iraq Resolution. He has since called for withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, leaving no permanent military bases. A press release from Barr's presidential campaign stated: "The next president should commit to a speedy and complete withdrawal from Iraq, and tell the Iraqi people that the U.S. troops will be going home."Press Releases: Tell Iraqis No Permanent Bases, Says Bob Barr, Bob Barr 208 campaign site, June 3, 2008.

As an alternative, he proposes a form of consumption tax, such as the FairTax. He also favors drastic reductions in government spending and the elimination of corporate welfare. The National Review described Barr as one of the few people able to "ask effective questions and make clear points" while questioning government witnesses during the 1995 House Waco siege hearings on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Federal Bureau of Investigation actions against the Branch Davidians in 1993, sponsored by subcomittees of the House Judiciary Committee and Government Reform and Oversight Committee.Ramesh Ponnuru, Hearing impaired – hearings on Whitewater and Waco, National Review, August 28, 1995.

Barr is best known for his role as one of the House managers during the Clinton impeachment trial. It was Barr who first introduced a resolution directing the House Judiciary Committee to inquire into impeachment proceedingsHouse Resolution 304, 105th Congress – months before the Monica Lewinsky scandal came to light. Foremost among the concerns Barr cited at the time was apparent obstruction of Justice Department investigations into Clinton campaign fundraising from foreign sources, chiefly the People's Republic of China.Congressman Barr lowers the boom Insight on the News After the Lewinsky scandal broke, Barr was the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation.McCaffrey, Shannon. Will Bob Barr be the Ralph Nader of '08? Associated Press (via CBS News), 2008-06-22. During debate on the impeachment resolution on the House floor, Barr argued that Clinton's attempt to interfere with Lewinsky's testimony in the Paula Jones case endangered the Constitution. In doing so, Barr said, Clinton violated what Barr called a "fundamental right" of any American citizen – "the unshakable right each one of us has to walk into a courtroom and demand the righting of a wrong."Congressional Record of Clinton impeachment debate In 1999, during Clinton's impeachment trial, Hustler publisher Larry Flynt offered money to anyone who could provide evidence that a prominent Republican had engaged in an extramarital affair. According to the American Journalism Review,"Gatekeepers Without Gates" by Alicia C. Shepard, AJR, March 1999. investigators for Flynt said that Barr was "guilty of king-size hypocrisy." In accordance with his public offer, Flynt subsequently paid a sum of money to Gail Barr after she had made an affidavit.  Investigators reported that Barr had "invoked a legal privilege during his 1985 divorce proceeding so he could refuse to answer questions on whether he'd cheated on his second wife with the woman who is now his third.""Gail Barr Affidavit"  In the early 1990s, Barr was photographed at a fundraising event licking whipped cream off a woman."Raising the Barr" The Economist 2008-05-29.

'Not exactly Mr. Effusive,' says Matt Towery, the former chairman of Newt Gingrich's political organization, who observed the brief and awkward licking. 'You can hardly get the guy to smile.'"Bob Barr, the Master of a Curious Universe, Monday, August 18, 2008; Page C01  Since leaving Congress in 2003, Barr has become a vocal opponent of the Patriot Act and has stated that he voted for it reluctantly and regrets voting for it, only agreeing because the Bush administration promised not to attempt to expand the granted powers or use them for non-terrorism purposes, and the administration agreed to report to Congress on their usage.Bob Barr speech, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, October 28, 2008 Barr says that the Bush administration promptly ignored these three promises given to Congress and has used the powers granted from the Patriot Act to further erode due process of law even in matters unrelated to terrorism. Barr claims that the Clinton administration did much of the same thing. In 2005&nbsp;– the year the Patriot Act was due for renewal&nbsp;– Barr helped found an organization called Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, a bipartisan group dedicated to eliminating aspects of the Patriot Act that could potentially affect law-abiding citizens rather than terrorists, and to "restore traditional checks and balances on government power so the country can effectively fight terror without sacrificing the rights of innocent Americans, rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution."www.checkbalances.org  Barr still serves as the group's chairman. Barr has been a vocal opponent of President George W. Bush's claim of authorization to wiretap transnational phone calls without individual judicial license. He has said, "What's wrong with it is several-fold. One, it's bad policy for our government to be spying on American citizens through the National Security Agency. Secondly, it's bad to be spying on Americans without court oversight. And thirdly, it's bad to be spying on Americans apparently in violation of federal laws against doing it without court order." In 2006, he debated the architect of the Patriot Act, Viet Dinh, on terrorism and privacy issues. In the 2004 presidential election, Barr left the Republican Party and publicly endorsed the Libertarian Party presidential nominee Michael Badnarik. In 2006, he joined the Libertarian Party as a regional representative, then serving on the Libertarian National Committee.

Barr said: "I'm happy to announce that I am now a proud, card-carrying Libertarian who is committed to helping elect leaders who will strive for smaller government, lower taxes and abundant individual freedom."  In Congress, Barr's strong stance against medical marijuana put him at odds with marijuana policy reformers such as the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP). Despite this historic antagonism, in March 2007, Barr reversed his stance on medical marijuana and began lobbying on behalf of MPP. This new partnership saw Barr working to repeal his very own "Barr Amendment"&nbsp;– the amendment that overturned a voter-approved medical marijuana initiative in Washington, D.C. and bars consideration of similar initiatives. Barr has been careful to note that he isn't pro-drug, but rather against government intrusion.  In interviews he has expressed the nuanced position of simultaneously opposing legalization, yet advocating the federalist ideals of State legislation and enforcement over Federal control.For example, see Federalist No. 45. Barr's reversal on drug policy surprised many, particularly MPP. His new-found appreciation for harm reduction was heartily welcomed:  Barr is one of the four founders of the American Freedom Agenda, which is described as "a coalition established to restore checks and balances and civil liberties protections under assault by the executive branch."

In early 2008, rumors circulated that Barr was considering a presidential run under the Libertarian Party banner. Activists began a Facebook group dedicated to drafting Barr into the nomination contest, and Barr later confirmed his interest. He launched a presidential exploratory committee and campaign website on April 5, and formally announced his candidacy for the Libertarian nomination on May 12.  His announcement came a mere ten days before the start of the Libertarian Party Convention, where delegates select the presidential candidate. Following his announcement, Rasmussen Reports had Barr polling at 6% nationwide against Barack Obama (42%), John McCain (38%), and Ralph Nader (4%). The study identified Barr as the Libertarian candidate, but most voters said they didn't know enough about him to have an opinion of him personally. Barr's support in the poll was a net drain on Republicans; he picked up 7% of the Republican vote, 5% of the Democratic vote, and 5% of the unaffiliated vote. On May 25, 2008, Barr became the 2008 Libertarian presidential nominee after six rounds of voting at the 2008 Libertarian convention. He beat Mary Ruwart in the final round of voting, with 324 delegates to Ruwart's 276, with 26 none-of-the-above votes.

Barr had expressed interest in running for Congress again as a Republican in 2012, challenging incumbent Republican Tom Graves in Georgia's 14th district.  The district was previously the 9th, but redistricting added Floyd and Paulding counties to the district.  Those two counties were part of the territory Barr represented in his first congressional stint, and make up 38 percent of the 14th's population.  Barr has lived in Smyrna, in Cobb County, for many years, but has told several friends he plans to move to Paulding County. Despite strong polling numbers, Barr chose to abandon his plans for running, citing concern on the potential impact it would have on his law firm and family.
