     The city of Solothurn ( ; ; ; ) is the capital of the Canton of Solothurn in Switzerland. The city also is the only municipality of the district of the same name. The official language of Solothurn is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect. The oldest finds from Solothurn city probably date from the Paleolithic era.  The remains of a Mesolithic camp were discovered in 1986 during renovations of the former  Kino Elite building.  From the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age, only a few scattered items have been discovered.  The Roman settlement at Solothurn was probably built around AD 15-25 as a road station and bridge head on the road from Aventicum to Augusta Raurica or Vindonissa.  A small vicus or settlement quickly developed around the castrum.  Solothurn is first mentioned in 219 as vico salod[uro] on the so-called Eponastein.  The name may indicate either that a Celtic settlement existed on the site before or just be a testimony to the mixed Gallo-Roman culture in the north-west provinces of the Roman Empire.  It came to be known as Salodurum.  Its strategical importance lay in the position at the approach to the Rhine from southeast.  In the 2nd-3rd Century AD, the vicus expanded rapidly to fill almost all of what is now the old city of Solothurn, including a portion of today's suburb south of the Aare. The Roman bridge was probably somewhat above the current Wengibrücke.  The Roman era river bed was  north of the present Aare river.  The main street of the Vicus was well below the present main street.  In addition to the normal government of the settlement, there were two mayors (magistri), and a six-member college (seviri Augustales), which was entrusted with supporting the imperial cult.  Salodurum was also home to a guard detachment of the XXII Legion, whose high command was stationed in Mainz in Germany.  According to inscriptions, there was a temple of Jupiter, a temple of Apollo Augustus and an altar to the goddess of horses Epona, who was popular in the Roman military and of Celtic origin.  However, the locations of those three temples is not known.  There was bath house on the main street and a pottery district in the northwest of the town which have been documented archaeologically.  A cemetery with urns and cremation burials on the eastern end of the Vicus was discovered in 1762-63 during the demolition of the old church of St. Ursus.  In addition, two Roman tombs were discovered in the same area. Around 325-350, the unfortified settlement along the road was transformed into a fortified camp or castrum, which covered only half of the former settlement area.  A  thick and  high wall was built around the settlement.  The new, fortified town was bell-shaped, and is still visible in the cadastral map of the city.  At various points in the city, large and small pieces of the old Roman wall are still visible in the houses of the old town.  The location of a gate in the north and a tower in the south-east corner are known and it is likely that there were additional gates and towers.  Almost nothing is known about the buildings inside the walls.  In the Early Middle Ages there were two settlement centres, a secular settlement in the former castrum and a religious settlement on the grounds of the late-Roman cemeteries outside the walls.  Both the religious histories and archeological discoveries indicate that both areas remained inhabited continuously into the Early Middle Ages.  The former chapel of St. Stephen inside the castrum was built on the foundation of an earlier, late-Roman building.  A burial memorial in the cemetery of the nearby St. Peter's Chapel dates to around the collapse of the Roman Empire.  By the middle of the 5th Century, St. Eucherius of Lyon mentions the martyrdom of St. Ursus and St. Victor and a cult of saints in Solothurn.  About 500 AD, the Burgundian Princess Sedeleuba took the bones of St. Victor to Geneva, while the bones of St. Ursus remained in Solothurn.  The church dedicated to the veneration of Saint Ursus is first mentioned in 870.  During the Early Middle Ages, Solothurn was part of the Kingdom of Lotharingia (Lorraine).  After the collapse of Lotharingia, it became part of the Second Kingdom of Burgundy.  In 1033, the Kingdom of Burgundy became part of the Holy Roman Empire and Solothurn gained some independence.  In 1038, Emperor Conrad II held court at Solothurn and there crowned his son, Henry III King of Burgundy.  The royal court resided in Solothurn on several occasions until 1052, however, there is no evidence of a permanent royal palace.  In 1127, it was acquired by the dukes of Zähringen.  Under the rule of the Zähringens, in 1146, Solothurn's coins are first mentioned.  In 1182, causidicus or Zähringen appointed judges first appeared in Solothurn.  After the extinction of the Zähringer line in 1218 it became a free imperial city under the Holy Roman Emperor.   In 1252, the town council and Schultheiss or mayor became mostly independent and had their own town seals.  In 1251 it was mentioned as saluerre and in 1275 as Solotren.  Starting around 1200, there was a council of nobles in the town. In 1252, a group of nobles that could witness and support deeds, known as consuls et cives Solodorenses, first appears in the town.  Initially the nobles exercised power over the entire town.  However, the guild movement of the 14th Century resulted in a reduction in the power of the nobles and also a restricted guild system in Solothurn.  By around 1350, an eleven-member Altrat (Council of Elders) and a 22-member Jungrat (Younger Council) existed in the city.  Each of the eleven guilds were represented by a member of the Altrat and two members of the Jungrat.  These 33 councillors exercised, together with the mayor, the power of government and helped appoint law makers.  The members of the two councils were elected each year by the citizens of the city, after which the councils and mayor appointed many of the government officials. The noble families retained some power as the guilds became part of the town council. However, in 1459 the last noble family died out and positions on the council fell to wealthy farmers, butchers and millers. Until the pogrom on 1348 during an outbreak of the plague, there was a small Jewish community in Solothurn. Over the 13th to 15th centuries, the citizens of the city slowly emancipated themselves from the higher nobility.  In 1276 and 1280 Emperor Rudolf I codified the previously poorly defined rights of the city and granted it the privilege de non Evocando or the right that their citizens were protected from trial in foreign courts.  In 1344 Solothurn acquired the right to appoint their own Schultheiss from the Count of Buchegg, which was confirmed by Emperor Charles IV in 1360.  In 1409, Emperor Ruprecht extended the de non Evocando privilege to include the royal High Court as well. As the city grew in power, it bound the Monastery of St. Ursus more closely to the city.  In 1251 the city defeated claims made by the Monastery on the right to appoint the Schultheiss.  Shortly after the acquisition of the right to the Schultheiss office in 1344, the city came into possession of the vogt right over the Monastery by granting citizenship rights to the former vogt (bailiff), Burkhard Senn the Elder.  In 1512-20 the city received the right to appoint canons and provosts from the Pope. After the alliance with Bern in 1295, it became part of the Swiss Confederation. In 1382 the Habsburgs attacked the city, involving Solothurn in the Battle of Sempach. By the treaty of two years later, the Habsburgs renounced all claims to the territory of the city. The latter was expanded by acquisition of neighbouring lands in the 15th century, roughly up to the today's canton area. In 1481, it obtained full membership in the Swiss Confederation. From 1530 to 1792 it was the seat of the French ambassador to Switzerland.  Before 1200 there was a Zähringer fortified tower north of the Monastery of St. Ursus.  In the first half of the 13th Century, a city wall was built around the area of the former castrum as well as the adjoining industrial area to the east and the churches of St. Peter and St. Urs.  Near the Monastery of St. Ursus, a Franciscan monastery was built, and after 1280 it formed the northern city wall on the eastern part of the city.  In 1532, the French embassy with a church and stately home was built in the eastern half of the city.  In the western part of Solothurn, the town hall was built.  First it was along the main street and in 1476 it moved south of the Franciscan monastery.  A main market place grew up along the main street, and in the first half of the 17th century it moved to the northern banks of the Aare river.  The town hall, market place and clock tower formed the political and economic centre of city life.   The medieval cooperative election of the mayor and councillors led to the creation of a nearly hereditary oligarchy by the 15th Century.  By the second half of the 16th Century, the political voice of citizens was nearly totally suppressed.  By the second half of the 17th Century, the government was run by a small group of patricians.  The oligarchs were weakened in the 18th Century, when in 1718-21 the city council managed to regain some powers.  However, in 1682, a new citizenship law prevented wealthy families who had moved into Solothurn from becoming members of the council.  While this law reduced the number of people who could be on the city council, the introduction of a secret ballot procedure in 1764 and measures against vote-buying in 1774 allowed more and more non-patrician burghers to join the council. During the heyday of the patricians in the 17th and 18th Centuries, a number of elegant town houses (Reinert House 1692-93, Palais Besenval 1703-06) and summer residences outside the city (Sommerhaus Vigier 1648-50, Waldegg Castle 1682-86, Steinbrugg Castle 1665-68 and Blumenstein Castle 1725-28) were built.  A number of new public buildings were also added including; the Arsenal (1610–19), the town hall with its north staircase tower (1632–34) and its eastern façade (Archive tower 1624, completed 1703-14), the Jesuit church (1680–89), the new Ambassadorenhof (1717–24), the Holy Spirit Hospital in a suburb (1735–1800) and the new classicist Church of St. Ursus (1763–90).  In the 16th Century the town walls were reinforced with the Basel gate and three round towers. Between 1667-1727, following plans by Francesco Polatta, Jacques Le Prestre Tarade and Sébastien de Vauban, the city built fortifications with eleven full and half bastions.  The new city wall increased the size of the city by including the eastern suburb of Kreuzacker.  Until the 18th Century, prisoners were housed in the towers of the medieval and early modern fortifications store.  Between 1753-61 a new prison was built outside the city walls, which remained in use into the 20th Century.  A gallows was first mentioned in 1460 and was located northeast of the city near Feldbrunnen.  A second gallows was located to the southwest of the city. The Early Modern Period in Solothurn ended, as in the rest of Switzerland, with the French invasion in 1798.  Following the capitulation of Solothurn on 2 March 1798, the French General Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg set up a provisional government on the following day.  The new government met in April to set up the new constitution.  The eleven old Vogtei (baillywicks) were replaced by five districts: Solothurn, Biberist, Balsthal, Olten, and Dornach.  The municipal Bürgergemeinde laid claim to the assets of the defunct city-state and in 1801 it received the Sönderungsconvention, large estates and extensive forest land outside the city.  In 1831 the cantonal parliament withdrew all political power from the eleven city guilds.  Over the following years (1831–1842) all the guilds were dissolved.  Due to the municipal law of 1859, the enforcement of the Federal Constitution of 1874 and the Cantonal Constitution of 1875, an Einwohnergemeinde was created.  The Einwohnergemeinde included all residents of the city, as opposed to the more limited Bürgergemeinde.  The division of property between residents and the Bürgergemeinde proved to be lengthy and could not be completed until 1978 and then only with the help of the Executive Council. On 15 October 1817, Tadeusz Kościuszko, the national hero of Poland and United States, died in Solothurn and was initially interred in the local cemetery. In 1828 Solothurn became the seat of the Bishop of Basel. Since 1897, the municipal council has been elected by proportional voting and consists of 30 members and 15 alternate members.  As the executive body, it elects the council commission (seven members).  Mayor and Vice-Mayor are elected by the people.  The municipal assembly is the legislative body.  The composition of the council remained remarkably stable between 1917-73.  The Liberals held an average of 60% of the seats, the Social Democrats and the Conservative People's Party (CVP today), about 20% each.  In 1970, the municipality granted voting rights for women.  With the emergence of new parties, the Liberals lost its dominant position. 2009, the FDP 30%, SP 23%, CVP 23%, the Greens 17% and 7% of the votes go to the SVP.
