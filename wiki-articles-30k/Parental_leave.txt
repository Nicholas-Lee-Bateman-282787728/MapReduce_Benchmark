  Parental leave or family leave is an employee benefit available in almost all countries. The terms "parental leave" and "family leave" include maternity, paternity, and adoption leave. Often, the minimum benefits are stipulated by law. Unpaid parental leave is provided when an employer is required to hold an employee's job while that employee is taking care of a child. Paid parental leave provides paid time off work to care for a child or make arrangements for the child's welfare.   The funds are typically subsidized by higher paid workers, and sometimes by employers (such as in England). Parental leave has been available as a legal right and/or governmental program for many years, in one form or another.  In 2014, the International Labor Organization reviewed parental leave policies in 185 countries and territories, and found that all countries except Papua New Guinea have laws mandating leave.International Labor Organization. (2014). Maternity and Paternity at Work: Law and Practice Across the World. The United States has unpaid parental leave, available equally to mothers and fathers, mandated by law, while many other countries have paid maternity leave and a few have paid paternity leave. Private employers sometimes provide either or both unpaid and paid parental leave outside of any legal mandate. Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum have developed an economic model known as the Capabilities approach, where basic freedoms and opportunities are included in economic assessments of a country's well-being, in addition to GDP.Sen, Amartya. 1999. Development as Freedom. New York: Anchor Books.Nussbaum, Martha. 2011. Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 34 Nussbaum proposed 10 central capabilities as the minimum requirement for a decent society. In Nussbaum's model, states should provide the resources and freedoms to ensure people have the opportunity to achieve a minimum threshold of each central capability. Universal, paid parental leave is an example resource states can provide so people have the option of starting a family while also working; for instance, under capacity 10 (control of one's environment), the state has a responsibility to ensure all people have "the right to seek employment on an equal basis with others." Whether parental leave contributes to gender equality depends upon (a) whether laws consider a child to be the responsibility of both parents and (b) whether the leave is equal as to the sexes.  An example of a law that does not consider fathers equally responsible is England's parental responsibility law, which is gender-neutral and equal, but baseline applies only to fathers married to the mother at the time of the birth and thus exempts fathers not married to the mother unless someone brings an action on behalf of the child. An equal leave policy would consider the father to be more responsible than the mother for child care after birth, as the time in the womb is counted solely to the mother; in such a policy, mothers would be expected to consume leave for pregnancy, delivery and early lactation that would be matched by time fathers take later in the child's life. In a 2014 Swiss study, Lanfranconi & Valarino identified one of the important ways Switzerland has considered parental leave policies is related to gender equality, where parental leave "enabl[es]  a more equal division of work between men and women by fostering paternal involvement in childcare."Lanfranconi, L. M., & Valarino, I. (2014). Gender equality and parental leave policies in Switzerland: A discursive and feminist perspective. Critical Social Policy, 34(4), p. 551. doi:10.1177/0261018314536132 Similarly, a 2015 study by Rønsen & Kitterød found that part of the effect of Norwegian parental leave policy "contributed to... a more equal division of paid and unpaid work among parents."Rønsen, M., & Kitterød. R. H. (2015). Gender-equalizing family policies and mothers’ entry into paid work: recent evidence from Norway. Feminist Economics, 10(1):59-89. p. 59 Paid parental leave incentivizes labor market attachment for women both before and after birth, affecting GDP and national productivity, as the workforce is larger.Geyer, J., Haan, P. & Wrohlich, K.

These could be added Parental leave increases income at the household level, as well, by supporting dual-earner families.Esping-Andersen, G. (2003). Women in the New Welfare Equilibrium. European Legacy, 8(5), 599. Paid parental leave incentivizes childbirth, which affects the future workforce.  It is thus argued that paid parental leave, in contrast to unpaid parental leave, is harmful to children's welfare because in countries with an aging workforce or countries with Sub-replacement fertility, children are born not because the parents want the child and can meet the child's needs but because children are expected to support their parents.  Some see children as responsible for supporting all those in older generations in the society (not just the child's specific parents); their earnings are expected not to be saved for the children's own old age, but to be spent on the earlier generations' demand for social security and pensions for which there was inadequate savings.Bittman, M. (1999). Parenthood Without Penalty: Time Use And Public Policy In Australia And Finland. Feminist Economics, 5(3), 27-42. doi:10.1080/135457099337798Esping-Andersen, G. (2003). Women in the New Welfare Equilibrium. European Legacy, 8(5), p. 606 Paid parental leave (in contrast to unpaid parental leave), like all welfare programs that relieve parents of the costs of raising children, incentivizes having children. This can present child welfare concerns when parents have children without being prepared to meet the child's needs. This harms the child's welfare, sometimes irreparably. Women have traditionally been paid to have children via certain legal structures in marriage, and men exempted from personal responsibility for their children, and some psychologists, such as Dorothy Dinnerstein and Alice Miller, have identified this as a structural harm to children that becomes "normalized", so that its roots are hidden.  They see any payment to parents to have children as inevitably a disability imposed on the children that impairs their development. The neoclassical model of labor markets predicts that if the cost of hiring women of child-bearing years is anticipated to increase (either because the employer is mandated to pay for maternity leave, or because she will be absent from work on public leave), then the "demand" for women in the labor market will decrease. While gender discrimination is illegal, without some kind of remedy, the neoclassical model would predict "statistical discrimination" against hiring women of child-bearing years.Akerlof, G. A., & Kranton, R. E. (2010). Identity Economics: How Our Identities Shape Our Work, Wages, and Well-Being. Princeton: Princeton University PressEsping-Andersen, G. (2003). Women in the New Welfare Equilibrium. European Legacy, 8(5), If women take long parental leaves, the neoclassical model would predict that their lifetime earnings and opportunities for promotion will be less than their male or childfree counterparts, or the "motherhood penalty."Theunisse, G., Verbruggen, M., Forrier, A., & Sels, L. (2011). Career Sidestep, Wage Setback? The Impact of Different Types of Employment Interruptions on Wages. Gender, Work & Organization, 18e110-e131. doi:10.1111/j.1468-0432.2009.00471.x Women may seek out employment sectors that are "family-friendly" (i.e., with generous parental leave policies), resulting in occupational sex segregation.Datta Gupta, N., Smith, N. & Verner, M. 2008. The Impact of Nordic Countries’ Family Friendly Policies on Employment, Wages, and Children. Review of Economics of the Household 6(1): 65–89. Nielsen, Simonsen, and Verner examine what the different outcomes for women in Denmark are between the "family-friendly" and the "non-family-friendly" sector.[10] In Denmark, the public sector is "family-friendly" because of its generous leave and employee benefits; workers decide which sector to work on based on their preferences and  opportunities. The study found that while in the "family-friendly" sector, there was basically no wage loss related to taking parental leave, women did have consistent earnings loss in the "non-family-friendly" private sector for a 1-year leave.[10] Universal, paid parental leave can be privately funded (i.e., corporations are mandated to absorb the cost of paid parental time off as part of employee benefits) or publicly funded (i.e., transferred directly to workers on leave, like unemployment insurance). Concerns about private funding include the statistical discrimination described above as well as the costs to smaller businesses. Datta Gupta, Smith, & Verneer found in 2008 that, while publicly funded parental leave has benefits, it is very expensive to fund and question if it is the most cost-effective use of funds. Financing sources for "publicly" paid parental leave vary widely.  In the programs in California and New Jersey, a payroll income tax is levied, exempting income earners who don't pay payroll taxes, such as those with passive income from stocks and bonds and sale of assets.   The financing thus has a regressive effect, particularly requiring higher paid workers, such as college-educated workers, to finance the paid leave of workers on whom passive earners profit.  In England, the employer is required to pay for the leave, which has been considered to cause employers to avoid hiring women. In England, while the parental responsibility law is gender-neutral and equal, only those fathers married to the mother have baseline responsibility, exempting some fathers from personal responsibility for their children so that they do not take parental leave. Typically, the effects of parental leave are improvements in prenatal and postnatal care, including a decrease in infant mortality. The effects of parental leave on the labor market include an increase in employment, changes in wages, and fluctuations in the rate of employees returning to work. Leave legislation can also impact fertility rates. A study in Germany found that wages decreased by 18 percent for every year an employee spends on parental leave. However, after the initial decrease in wages, the employee’s salary rebounds faster than the salary of someone not offered parental leave. A study of California’s leave policy, the first state in the U.S. to require employers to offer paid parental leave, showed that wages did increase. Parental leave can lead to greater job security. Studies differ in how this helps return to work after taking time off. Some studies show that if a parent is gone for more than a year after the birth of a child, it decreases the possibility that he or she will return. Other studies of shorter leave periods show that parents no longer need to quit their jobs in order to care for their children, so employment return increases.  In 2013, Joseph, Pailhé, Recotillet, and Solaz published a natural experiment evaluating a 2004 policy change in France. They were interested in the economic effects of full-time, short paid parental leave.  Before the reform, women had a mandatory two-month parental leave, and could take up to three years unpaid parental leave with their job guaranteed, though most women only took the two months.  The new policy, complément libre choix d'activité (CLCA), guarantees six months of paid parental leave.  The authors found positive effects on employment: compared to women in otherwise similar circumstances before the reform, first-time mothers who took the paid leave after the reform were more likely to be employed after their leave, and less likely to stay out of the labor force.  The authors point to similar results of full-time, short paid parental leave observed in Canada in 2008 by Baker and Milligan,Baker, M., Milligan, K.,2008. How does job-protected maternity leave affect mothers' employment? Journal of Labor Economics 26,655–692. and in Germany in 2009 by Kluve and Tamm.Kluve, J.,Tamm,M.,2009. Now daddy's changing diapers and mommy's making her career: evaluating a generous parental leave regulation using a natural experiment. IZA Discussion Papers 4500. Institute for the Study of Labor(IZA).  However, Joseph, et al., also found that wages were lower (relative to women before the reform) for medium- and highly educated women after the leave, which could be because the women returned to work part-time or because of a "motherhood penalty," where employers discriminate against mothers, taking the six-month leave as a "signal" that the woman will not be as good of an employee because of her mothering responsibilities. Rasmussen conducted regression analysis on a similar natural experiment in Denmark with a policy change in 1984 where parental leave increased from 14 to 20 weeks.Rasmussen, A. W. (2010). Increasing the length of parents' birth-related leave: The effect on children's long-term educational outcomes. Labour Economics, 17: 91-100. doi:10.1016/j.labeco.2009.07.007 Rasmussen found the increased length of parental leave had no negative effect on women's wages or employment, and in the short-run (i.e., 12 months) it had a positive effect on women's wages, compared to the shorter leave.  There was no difference on children's long-term educational outcomes before and after the policy change. Some of the most generous benefits are Norwegian parental leave benefits. Partly in an initiative to combat the "Motherhood penalty," Norway initiated a policy change in the mid-2000s to incentivize paternal leave. The new policy, sometimes called the "daddy quota" in Nordic family policy entitles families to additional leave than they would otherwise be eligible for if the father takes at least 12 weeks of leave, since reduced to 10 weeks as of July 2014.https://www.nav.no/en/Home/Benefits+and+services/Relatert+informasjon/Paternal+quota+%28paternity+leave%29%2C+maternal+quota+and+shared+period.353596.cms To evaluate this change, Rønsen & Kitterød looked at the rate and timing of women's return to work after giving birth, and the effect on this of the new parental leave policy. In their 2015 study, Rønsen & Kitterød found women in Norway returned to work significantly faster after the policy change.Rønsen, M., & Kitterød. R. H. (2015). Gender-equalizing family policies and mothers’ entry into paid work: recent evidence from Norway. Feminist Economics, 10(1):59-89. p. 84 However, public or subsidized daycare was greatly expanded at the same time, so Rønsen & Kitterød did not find that the "daddy quota" was solely responsible for the timing of work entry. But it can be understood to have an effect on division of household labor by gender when both parents can take time to care for a new baby. Fathers tend to use less parental leave than mothers in the United States as well as in other countries where paid leave is available,Bygren, M, and Duvander, A.-Z. 2006. "Parents' Workplace Situation and Fathers' Parental Leave Use." Journal of Marriage and Family. 68(2):363–372. and this difference may have factors other than the financial constraints which impact both parents. Bygren and Duvander, looking at the use of parental leave by fathers in Sweden, concluded that fathers’ workplace characteristics (including the size of the workplace, whether there were more men or women in the workplace, and whether the workplace was part of the private or public sector) influenced the length of parental leave for fathers, as did the presence of other men who had taken parental leave at an earlier point in time. A Harvard report cited research showing paid maternity leave “facilitates breastfeeding and reduces risk of infection.” This research also found that countries with parental leave had lower infant mortality rates. The United States, which does not have a paid parental leave law, ranked 56th in the world in 2014 in terms of infant mortality rates, with 6.17 deaths per every 1,000 children born. The research did not find any infant health benefits in countries with unpaid parental leave. The same Harvard report also linked paid parental leave and a child’s psychological health. It found that parents with paid parental leave had more intense bonds with their children. While studies have shown conflicting results, some research has shown a link between paid parental leave and higher fertility rates. The research looked at women 25–34 years old, who are more likely to be affected by leave legislation. Fertility rates peaked for those between 25-29 and 30-34 across European countries. In the U.S., while the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 allows for unpaid parental leave, due to economic concerns, parents often do not utilize this eligibility to its fullest extent, and as a result, some studies show that the FMLA has had a limited impact on the leave-taking behavior of new parents.Han, W.-J. and Waldfogel, J. 2003. "Parental Leave: The Impact of Recent Legislation on Parents' Leave-Taking." Demography. 40(1):191–200. Though specific amounts can vary, having a child (including the cost of high-quality childcare) costs families approximately $11,000 in the first year. These financial issues contribute to new mothers in the United States returning to work quicker than new mothers in European countries – approximately one-third of women in the United States return to work within three months of giving birth, compared to approximately five per cent in the UK, Germany, and Sweden,Berger, L.M., Hill, J. et al. 2005. "Maternity Leave, Early Maternal Employment and Child Health Development in the US." The Economic Journal. 115(501):F29-F47. and just over half of mothers in the United States with a child under the age of one work.(Johnson 2007) Research on parental employment in Northern European countries, which have some of the longest paid parental leave policies for both mothers and fathers (e.g. Sweden, Norway, and Denmark), find that mothers have very high rates of full-time work participation.Ellingsæter, A. L. (2009). Leave policy in the Nordic welfare states: a 'recipe' for high employment/high fertility?. Community, Work & Family, 12(1), 1-19. doi:10.1080/13668800801890152 Some businesses adopt policies that are favorable to workers and public opinion. In their study of maternity leave policies in the United States, Kelly and Dobbin found that public policy surrounding pregnancy as a temporary disability (for instance, California's Family Temporary Disability Insurance program) gave rise to business practices that included maternity leave as a benefit.Kelly, E. and Dobbin, F. 1999. "Civil Rights Law at Work: Sex Discrimination and the Rise of Maternity Leave Policies." The American Journal of Sociology. 105(2):455–492. Companies are starting to offer paid parental leave as a benefit to some American workers, seeing a profitable aspect of doing so, including: reduced turnover costs, increased productivity from workers, and increased rates of retention among women after childbirth. Some see the increase in paid parental leave as indicative of companies reaching out to women, as more women are working and returning to work after having children, and by doing so these companies generate positive publicity as employers with family-friendly workplaces.Miller,K., Helmuth, A.S. et al. 2009. "The Need for Paid Parental Leave Policy: Adapting to a Changing Workforce." Institute for Women's Policy Research. Washington, D.C.  Working Mother magazine [ ] publishes a list of 100 Best Companies for working mothers each year, a list which is noted not only by the readership of the magazine, but also by corporate America and increasingly by researchers and policy institutes as well. The Institute for Women’s Policy Research[ ] issued a report in 2009 encouraging Congress to give federal workers four weeks of paid parental leave. The report cited statistics from the Working Mother 100 Best Company list, using private sector corporations as examples of substantial increase in the retention of new mothers after instituting a longer maternity leave policy. The report also noted that it would take newer workers four years to accrue enough paid leave (sick leave and annual leave) to equal the 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave provided under the FMLA, and that private sector companies which offer paid parental leave have a significant advantage over the federal government in the recruitment and retention of younger workers who may wish to have children. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women introduces "maternity leave with pay or with comparable social benefits without loss of former employment, seniority or social allowances".Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Article 11, 2 (b) The Maternity Protection Convention C 183 adopted in 2000 by International Labour Organization requires 14 weeks of maternity leave as minimum condition.Maternity Protection Convention C 183, Article 4 National laws vary widely according to the politics of each jurisdiction. Only two countries do not mandate paid time off for new parents: Papua New Guinea and the United States.Addati, L., Cassirer, N., & Gilchrist, K. (2014, May 13). Maternity and paternity at work: Law and practice across the world. International Labour Organization. 978-92-2-128630-1[ISBN]. Unless otherwise specified, the information in the tables below is gathered from the most recent International Labour Organization reports.  Maternity leave refers to the legal protection immediately after a mother gives birth, paternity leave to immediately after a spouse gives birth, and parental leave to protected time for childcare after the maternity/paternity leave. Parental leave is generally available to either parent, except where specified.  Leave marked "Unpaid" indicates the job is protected for the duration of the leave.  Different countries have different rules regarding eligibility for leave, and long a parent has to have worked at their place of employment prior to giving birth before they are eligible for paid leave. Australia has introduced an 18-week paid parental leave scheme which is publicly funded and provides the National Minimum Wage rather than a percentage of the primary caregiver's salary. It is not be available to families where the primary caregiver has an annual salary above $150,000 per annum."Budget 2009-10: Expense Measures", http://www.budget.gov.au/2009-10/content/bp2/html/bp2_expense-13.htm, Australian Government As international organizations are not subject to the legislation of any country, they have their own internal legislation on parental leave.
