    Galactus is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Galactus was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in the comic book Fantastic Four #48, published in March 1966. In his first appearance in The Fantastic Four, Galactus was depicted as a god-like figure who feeds by draining living planets of their energy. After debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, Galactus has played a role in over four decades of Marvel continuity. The character has been featured in other Marvel products, such as arcade games, video games, animated television series, and the 2007 film Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. In 2009, Galactus ranked 5th on IGN's list of "Top 100 Comic Book Villains"."Galactus is number 5" IGN.com, 2009. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist-coplotter Jack Kirby, the character debuted in The Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966, the first of a three-issue story later known as "The Galactus Trilogy").Thomas, Roy, Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe (Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006), "Moment 29: The Galactus Trilogy", pp. 112–115. ISBN 1-4027-4225-8; ISBN 978-1-4027-4225-5  In 1966, nearly five years after launching Marvel Comics' flagship superhero title, Fantastic Four, creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the supervillain mold of the time with god-like stature and power. As Lee recalled in 1993,  Kirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee called the Silver Surfer:  Kirby elaborated, "Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way."Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert. "The King", Wizard #36, August 1994, via Brenni_Au/JackKirby (fan site).  Writer Mike Conroy expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanation: "In five short years from the launch of the Fantastic Four, the Lee/Kirby duo...had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives...there were the Skrulls, the Watcher and the Stranger, all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep."Conroy, Mike. 500 Comicbook Villains, Collins & Brown, 2004. This led to the introduction of Galactus in Fantastic Four #48–50 (March–May 1966), which fans began calling "The Galactus Trilogy".Thomas, Roy. Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe (Sterling Publishing: New York City, 2006), p. 113. ISBN 1-4027-4225-8; ISBN 978-1-4027-4225-5Lee, Stan, in Thomas, Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe, audio commentary #37 Kirby did not intend Galactus to reappear, to preserve the character's awe-inspiring presence. Reprinted in  Fan popularity, however, prompted Lee to ask Kirby for Galactus's reappearance, and the character became a mainstay of the Marvel Universe.  In order to preserve Galactus's mystique, his next two appearances were nonspeaking cameos in Thor #134 (November 1966), and Daredevil #37 (February 1968). Numerous requests from fans prompted the character to be featured heavily in Fantastic Four #72–77 (March–August 1968).A Failure to Communicate, Part 2, Jack Kirby Museum, June 19, 2012 (accessed February 14, 2015) After a flashback appearance in Silver Surfer #1 (August 1968), the character returned to Earth in Thor #160–162 (January–March 1969). Galactus's origin was revealed in Thor #168–169 (September–October 1969). The character made appearances in Fantastic Four #120–123 (March–June 1972) and Thor #225–228 (July–October 1974). These two storylines introduced two new heralds for Galactus. Galactus also featured in Fantastic Four #172–175 (July–October 1976) and #206–213 (May–December 1979). Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reunited for the origin of Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one-shot graphic novel The Silver Surfer, The Ultimate Cosmic Experience! in 1978. This Marvel Fireside Book, published by Simon & Schuster, was an out-of-continuity retelling of the origin story without the Fantastic Four. The full Lee-and-Kirby origin story was reprinted in the one-volume Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin #1 (May 1983), inked by Vince Colletta and George Klein, lettered by John Morelli and colored by Andy Yanchus. While nearly identical to the previous origin, this story featured supplemental material, edits, and deletions by writer Mark Gruenwald, pencillers John Byrne and Ron Wilson and inker Jack Abel. Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters the core of the collapsing universe before the Big Bang; the story was later reprinted as Origin of Galactus #1 (February 1996). The character guest-starred in Rom #26–27 (January–February 1982). Galactus featured in two related storylines of Fantastic Four #242–244 (May–July 1982) and #257 (August 1983). Another appearance in Fantastic Four #262 (January 1984) sparked controversy. At the end of the story, Eternity, an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus; Howard University professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing writer-artist John Byrne of using the character to "justify planetary-scale genocide."Singer, Marc. "Byrne's Fantastic Four, or Optimism" Howling Curmudgeons (fan site), 18 May 2004. WebCitation archive. Byrne and Stan Lee also collaborated on a one-shot Silver Surfer story (June 1982) in which it's revealed that after the Surfer's rebellion against Galactus, the planet eater returned to Zenn-La, the Surfer's homeworld, and drained it of energy after allowing the populace to flee. Writer-penciller John Byrne and inker Terry Austin produced "The Last Galactus Story" as a serial in the anthology comic-magazine Epic Illustrated #26–34 (October 1984–February 1986). Nine of a scheduled ten installments appeared. Each ran six pages, except part eight (which ran 12). The magazine was canceled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished; however, Byrne later published the conclusion on his website.Byrne, John, "Exception to the rule #1: 'The Last Galactus Story'", "Frequently Asked Questions – Questions about Aborted Storylines", Byrne Robotics, 15 February 2005. WebCitation archive.  Galactus played a pivotal role in the limited series Secret Wars #1–12 (May 1984 – April 1985), and became a recurring character in the third volume of the Silver Surfer (beginning with issue #1, July 1987). Artist John Buscema of the original Silver Surfer series produced a 64-page hardcover comic made all of full-page splash panels that Stan Lee scripted. It was published in October 1988 as Silver Surfer: Judgment Day. In it, Mephisto kidnaps two of Galactus's heralds, the Silver Surfer and Nova. Galactus himself invades Mephisto's realm to reclaim them. The cosmic battle between Mephisto and Galactus ends when the latter starts to absorb the life energy of Mephisto's "brimstone world", forcing the lord of evil to concede. Galactus was featured in the miniseries Infinity Gauntlet #1–6 (July&nbsp;– December 1991), Infinity War #1–6 (June&nbsp;– November 1992) and Cosmic Powers #1–6 (March&nbsp;– August 1994). The character starred in the six-issue miniseries Galactus the Devourer (September 1999&nbsp;– March 2000), written by Louise Simonson and illustrated by John Buscema, which climaxed with Galactus's death. Simonson originally conceived that the story arc would occur in the third volume of Silver Surfer, but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales. She proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she considered a "radical" idea concerning "why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus.""Questions & Answers With Writer Louise Simonson: Part 1: In The Beginning...", Galactus: The Devourer (fan site), n.d. Retrieved 14 April 2008. WebCitation archive. The consequences of Galactus's death are explored in the Fantastic Four Annual 2001 and Fantastic Four #46–49 (October 2001&nbsp;– January 2002), resulting in Galactus's revival. The character features in the first six issues of the series Thanos (December 2003&nbsp;– May 2004), written by Jim Starlin. The story is noteworthy due to its evaluation of the standard justifications (Social Darwinism and divine right of kings) for the character (by defending the need for a social contract with the rest of the universe) and its search for alternate means to feed his hunger. Issues #7–12, written by Keith Giffen, introduce the first herald (the Fallen One). Galactus's origin is re-examined in Fantastic Four #520–523 (October 2004&nbsp;– April 2005), where the character is temporarily reverted to his mortal form. After appearing in the limited series Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill #1–6 (March–August 2005) Galactus was a central character in the "Annihilation" storyline, appearing in the limited series Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1–4 (June–September 2006), Annihilation #1–6 (October 2006&nbsp;– March 2007) and the epilogue, Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus #1–2 (February–April 2007). Galactus was an antagonist in Fantastic Four #545–546 (June–July 2007), where he tried to devour fellow cosmic function Epoch. In Nova vol. 4, #13–15 (May–July 2008), the character had no dialogue. Author Andy Lanning said that he and co-writer Dan Abnett were "treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping."Rogers,Vaneta. "Galactus, and Surfer and Skrulls – Oh My! Abnett & Lanning on Nova", Newsarama, 10 April 2008 WebCitation archive. Galactus also appeared in the limited series Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter #1–3 (June–August 2009), a sequel to Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill. Galactus and the Silver Surfer appeared as antagonists in Skaar: Son of Hulk #9-11, and as protagonists in the limited series The Thanos Imperative (June–November 2010). Galactus was a member of the God Squad in the miniseries Chaos War #2–5 (December–March 2010). After an appearance in Fantastic Four #583–587 (November 2010&nbsp;– March 2011), the character returned to Earth in Silver Surfer vol. 6, #1–5 (January–May 2011) and was the antagonist in The Mighty Thor #1–6 (April–September 2011). In April 2015, Galactus made an appearance in issue 4 of the series The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl and issue 2 of the series Howard the Duck. Galactus was originally the explorer Galan, from the planet Taa, which existed in the pre-Big Bang universe. When a cataclysm gradually kills all other life in his universe, he and other survivors leave Taa on a spacecraft and are engulfed in the Big Crunch. Galan does not die, however; he is transformed by bonding with the Sentience of the Universe. He gestates for billions of years in the universe that formed after the Big Bang, emerging as Galactus. A Watcher (Ecce) sees Galactus's birth; although he recognizes his destructive nature, he chooses not to kill him.Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin #1 (May 1983).

In memory of his dead home world, Taa, and the first planet to fall prey to his hunger, Galactus constructs a new "home world" (Taa II), which is actually a Möbius strip-shaped space station the size of a solar system. It is so large that a star and several planets orbit it. Galactus later becomes involved in a civil war among the Proemial Gods, who came into being during the universe's infancy as caretakers of the cosmic balance. After a faction of the gods (led by Diableri of Chaos) tries to remake the universe in their image, Galactus kills Diableri and imprisons three other rebel gods (Antiphon, Tenebrous and Aegis) in the Kyln.Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus #2 (2007) Galactus is driven to create a being in his own image, Tyrant;Cosmic Powers #6 (August 1994).

The heroes succeed, and the newly empowered Terrax leads his master to Earth.

Marvel Comics. Later, believing that Terrax was trapped in a black hole, Galactus summoned the mutant known as Dazzler and empowered her to cosmic scale and temporarily made her into his herald, as he thought that Dazzler was one of the few beings in the universe that stood a chance of shedding light inside a black hole.Dazzler #10 Once inside the black hole, however, Dazzler found that Terrax was not trapped, but was actually hiding from his master. A fight started and, as Dazzler was still empowered by sound blasts that Galactus's ship kept firing inside the black hole, she was able to render Terrax unconscious. She returned the herald to his master and Galactus then went on with his usual business, forgetting about Dazzler. Only by glowing incredibly bright did she make her presence known and bring Galactus to return her to Earth.Dazzler #11 Galactus is later fooled by the Galadorian space knight Rom into trying to devour the Black Nebula, home of the Dire Wraiths.

The plan fails when Galactus chooses Superman instead, but Superman's strong will and the scale of influence that the destruction of Krypton has had on his development allows Superman to resist Galactus's conditioning. At the conclusion of the story, Superman and Reed Richards reprogram Galactus's equipment to drain energy from him instead of planets, ordering him to only feed on lifeless worlds in future.

Galactus appeared in the 1994 Fantastic Four two-part episode "Silver Surfer and the Coming of Galactus", voiced by Tony Jay. In the two-part episode "Silver Surfer and the Coming of Galactus", he arrives on Earth to prepare it for his consumption. Uatu tries to reason with him but to no avail. When Alicia Masters gets Silver Surfer to turn on Galactus, the Human Torch returns with the Ultimate Nullifier in his hands. Knowing that the Fantastic Four would use it against him, he spares the Earth and reclaims the Ultimate Nullifier. He then banishes Silver Surfer to Earth and places a barrier that prevents him from leaving. In the episode "Silver Surfer and the Return of Galactus", Doctor Doom steals Silver Surfer's powers and plots to steal Galactus's powers next. When Galactus arrived upon finding out about what happened to Silver Surfer's powers, he stopped Doctor Doom from stealing his powers. Afterwards, he returned Silver Surfer to his exile. In the episode "To Battle the Living Planet”, the Fantastic Four had to ask for Galactus's help in order to fight Ego the Living Planet. In the episode "When Calls Galactus", Terrax tricks Galactus into consuming a poisonous planet making him weak and tries to get the Fantastic Four into fighting him. This fails and Galactus devolves Terrax. Due to him being weak, he had no choice but to prepare Earth for his consumption again. Luckily, Nova ended up volunteering to become his next Herald which Galactus agrees to. Upon being empowered by Galactus, she leads him to a recommended section of space where there are non-inhabited planets for him to consume. Galactus appeared regularly in the Silver Surfer cartoon series, voiced by James Blendick. Unlike the rest of the characters (who were animated), Galactus was computer-generated. Galactus has arrived at Zenn-La to consume it. Norrin Radd sacrifices himself by offering to serve as Galactus's herald, whose job it will be to scout out planets without intelligent life so that Galactus won't destroy any civilizations. On the upside, Galactus gives Norrin a portion of his powers, turning him into the Silver Surfer. On the downside, the transference of powers remove Norrin's memories and his moral convictions! With no memories, the Silver Surfer finds world after world for Galactus to devour, but the Herald is troubled by the destruction. When it comes to Earth, Silver Surfer turns against Galactus after his memory was restored by Thanos and Ego the Living Planet. Galactus allows Silver Surfer to leave, but Silver Surfer discovers that Zenn-La was moved to another galaxy. In the episode "Antibody", Galactus is dying and Silver Surfer is called in to help cure Galactus in exchange that he tells him where Zenn-La is positioned. Afterwards, Silver Surfer learns that Galactus knows nothing about Zenn-La's location because in his anger, he hurled the planet so far away, even he doesn't knows where it came to rest. If there had been a Season Two, an episode called "Down to Earth" would depict Galactus's second attempt to devour Earth. Galactus appeared in The Super Hero Squad Show episode "Last Exit Before Doomsday", voiced by George Takei. After capturing Stardust, Doctor Doom has her lead him to Galactus. Doctor Doom strikes a deal with Galactus that in exchange for some of the Power Cosmic to help him find the Infinity Fractals, he will let Galactus eat the Earth. Galactus wasn't impressed with the deal and blasted Doctor Doom back to Earth. The approaching of Galactus caused everyone in Super Hero City to build a Helicarrier large enough to carry the inhabitants of Earth. When Galactus arrived on the moon and asks why it took so long to ready the Earth for consumption, the Heralds point at Silver Surfer. In the episode "This Al Dente Earth", Iron Man makes some jokes about Galactus causing him to attack Iron Man. When the Heralds are convinced not to let Galactus eat Earth and attack him, Galactus ends up teleporting his Heralds far away from Earth. He then arrives on Earth and reconstructs the large Helicarrier into the Destructo-Pump (a food processing-like device that will enable him to consume the Earth). While Iron Man and Mister Fantastic retrieve the Infinity Fractals that Doctor Doom has and reforge the Infinity Sword, the Super Hero Squad and other heroes of Super Hero City fight to prevent Galactus from consuming the Earth. Most of the superheroes ended up defeated and/or injured fighting him. The remaining superheroes received help from some of the Lethal Legion who tried to fight him and/or destroy his Destructo-Pump. When Iron Man and Mister Fantastic reforged the Infinity Sword, they tried to use it on Galactus and couldn't harm him even when Doctor Doom used it on him. After telling them that the Infinity Sword will only work for someone who wields The Infinity Gauntlet, Silver Surfer managed to convince Galactus to spare Earth and offer to become his Herald again in order to find planets with non-intelligent life on them. Galactus agrees and departs with Silver Surfer and the Infinity Sword. In the episode "Alienating with the Surfer", the Super Hero Squad come to the aid of the Skrull Homeworld when Galactus targets it for consumption and that Ronan the Accuser never showed up (thanks to Silver Surfer). The Super Hero Squad managed to hold off Galactus using food-shaped planets until Silver Surfer arrived and directed Galactus to a section of planets of non-intelligent life. In the episode "Fate of Destiny", Silver Surfer becomes Dark Surfer and uses the Infinity Sword and Infinity Gauntlet to erase the section of the universe where Galactus was. The character was featured in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. He first appeared in the episode "Prisoner of War" in a flashback, where a Skrull explained that Galactus has devoured their homeworld, so they are conquering Earth as a replacement. Galactus then appeared in the series finale, "Avengers Assemble", where he has come to devour Earth as well. He and his heralds fight against the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and other heroes, but ends up getting banished to the Negative Zone, where he can feed on its infinite anti-matter for eternity. Galactus made humorous cameo appearances in Spider-Man's cutaway comments in the Ultimate Spider-Man episodes "Back in Black" and "Beetle Mania". Galactus appeared in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode "Galactus Goes Green",PR: “Marvel’s Avengers Assemble: Assembly Required” Comes to DVD on October 8, 2013 voiced by John DiMaggio. Galactus arrives on Earth where he lands on Las Vegas in order to consume Earth. After Terrax was defeated, Galactus revoked his Power Cosmic and transformed She-Hulk into the Emerald Emissary with it. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. had to fight Galactus to keep him from consuming Earth. Following She-Hulk taking a dive in her fight against Terrax, Galactus returned the Power Cosmic to Terrax who takes Galactus to an uninhabited planet as part of the deal that She-Hulk made with Terrax. In the two-part episode "Planet Hulk", Ronan the Accuser and the Kree use Ego the Living Planet to be a sacrifice to Galactus. During this time, Galactus is shown to have Firelord as his new herald where Firelord claimed that Terrax failed him. Hulk had to work with Ego's inner-ego to keep Galactus from consuming Ego the Living Planet. After Hulk and Ego the Living Planet defeat Galactus, Firelord leads Galactus away to find an uninhabited planet for Galactus to consume. John DiMaggio reprises his role as Galactus in the Avengers Assemble episode "Guardians and Spaceknights". When Galactus arrives to consume Earth, Iron Man ends up having to speak with him which results in both of them teleporting away. The Avengers track Iron Man to the planet where the D'Bari live and witness their ships in the middle an evacuation after Iron Man (who was empowered by the Power Cosmic) led Galactus here. Upon the Avengers encountering the Guardians of the Galaxy, it was mentioned by them that there is "Galactus Contingency Plan" that most planets have in the event that Galactus arrives to consume an inhabited planet. The Avengers had to work with the Guardians of the Galaxy to keep Galactus from consuming the planet. It later turns out that the planet that Galactus was consuming was becoming unstable before Galactus arrived. Galactus found himself unable to stop the process as the Power Cosmic-empowered Iron Man quotes "Galactus must feed." After the planet exploded, Galactus was knocked out cold, the D'Bari settled on another planet, and Iron Man returned to normal. Galactus appeared in the 2007 film Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. The film's novelization calls the character "the Gah Lak Tus". 20th Century Fox's reason for portraying the character as a cosmic hurricane-like cloud was to keep him discreet. Visual effects studio Weta Digital convinced Fox to add hints of his comic-book appearance, including a shadow and a fiery mass inside the cosmic cloud resembling Galactus's signature helmet. Director Tim Story  said he created Galactus as a cosmic cloud so a future Silver Surfer spin-off film would be unique yet introduce the character as he normally appears. J. Michael Straczynski, the spinoff's writer, confirmed that Galactus was in his script: "You don't want to sort of blow out something that big and massive for one quick shot in the first movie." In this film, Galactus devours planets like in the comics, and uses the Silver Surfer as his herald to help him do it, in exchange for Galactus not eating the Surfer's home world. He is killed when the Surfer rebels against him to save the Earth. Galactus appears in the 1990 Silver Surfer NES game. Galactus appears as a prisoner of the Skrull in the Game Boy Advance game Fantastic 4 — Flame On. As the Human Torch you have to save him.

The Silver Surfer appears in order to help the player during the battle, using his fraction of the Power Cosmic to stun his master so that the heroes can damage him. In the ending however, he vowed revenge and plans to destroy the Earth. Galactus appears in the PSP and PS2 versions of Spider-Man: Web of Shadows as an assist character who steps on the enemies, saying "Your debt is paid." Galactus appears in the 2009 game Marvel Super Hero Squad as an unvoiced, minor character in a Silver Surfer cutscene. Galactus is mentioned in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2. When the player asks Thor about Galactus, he says he prevented Galactus from taking revenge on the heroes. Galactus appears in the Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet video game. Targeting the Skrull Homeworld for consumption, Galactus runs afoul of Wolverine and Black Widow. They use a cargo ship to dump food into his mouth, satisfying him enough to spare the Skrull Homeworld. When Silver Surfer uses the Infinity Sword and the Infinity Gauntlet to become Dark Silver Surfer, Galactus  wonders if he found any other planets; Dark Silver Surfer teleports him far from Earth. Galactus makes a brief appearance in LittleBigPlanet's Marvel-level pack in the first level. Galactus is the main antagonist and final boss of Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds voiced by Jonathan Adams. He creates Silver Surfer-based copies of Dormammu, Doctor Doom, Albert Wesker and Akuma, which the player fights while a timer counts down before he destroys the Earth.George, Richard "IGN: Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Enter Galactus", "IGN", 7 February 2011, accessed 7 February 2011.
