   The Beijing Subway is a rapid transit rail network that serves the urban and suburban districts of Beijing municipality.  The network has 18 lines, 334 stations and  of track in operation, and is the second longest subway system in the world after the Shanghai Metro. The subway is the world's busiest in annual ridership, with 3.41 billion trips delivered in 2014, averaging 9.2786 million per day, with peak single-day ridership reaching 11.5595 million. The Beijing Subway opened in 1969 and is the oldest metro system in mainland China.  The subway has undergone rapid expansion since 2002, as only two lines were in service before then. The most recent expansion came into effect on December 26, 2015 with the opening of the section of Line 14 from Beijing South Railway Station to Jintailu, Phase II of the Changping Line from Nanshao to Changping Xishankou, Andelibeijie Station on Line 8, and Datunlu East Station on Line 15. This expansion provides six new transfer stations, a second subway line to Beijing South Station, the largest railway station in Beijing, and subway access to the Ming Tombs, one of Beijing's largest tourist attractions.

Beijing Subway lines generally follow the checkerboard layout of the city.  Most lines through the urban core (outlined by the Line 10 loop) run parallel or perpendicular to each other and intersect at right angles.  Of the 18 lines, 12 are numbered and the other six are named after destinations in the outer suburbs. One line is currently operating in two separate sections.   The following lines run from the edge of the urban core to outer suburbs beyond the Fifth Ring Road.

Straddle beam monorail trains have lower transport capacity and operating speed (60&nbsp;km/h) than conventional subways, but are quieter to operate, have smaller turning radius and better climbing capability, and cost only one-third to one-half of subways to build.

In August 2015, planning authorities proposed an underground automatic people mover (APM) line through the Central Business District (CBD).(Chinese) 曹政, "CBD拟通'地下小火车:初步设8站 呈Z形斜穿'" Beijing Daily 2015-8-13 The line would run 4.9&nbsp;km and have eight stations from Dongdaqiao on Line 6 to Jiulongshan on Line 7, and has been incorporated into the 2020 Subway Plan. The subway was proposed in September 1953 by the city's planning committee and experts from the Soviet Union.Xinhuanet.com "北京地铁诞生记:周总理称筹建地铁是为备战" Part 1,北京日报 September 28, 2007 After the end of the Korean War, Chinese leaders turned their attention to domestic reconstruction. They were keen to expand Beijing's mass transit capacity but also valued the subway as an asset for civil defense. They studied the use of the Moscow Metro to protect civilians, move troops and headquarter military command posts during the Battle of Moscow, and planned the Beijing Subway for both civilian and military use. The Chinese lacked expertise in building subways and drew heavily on Soviet and East German technical assistance. In 1954, a delegation of Soviet engineers, including some who had built the Moscow Metro, was invited to plan the subway in Beijing. From 1953 to 1960, several thousand Chinese students were sent to the Soviet Union to study subway construction. An early plan unveiled in 1957 called for one ring route and six other lines with 114 stations and  of track. Two routes vied for the first to be built. One ran east-west from Wukesong to Hongmiao, underneath Changan Avenue. The other ran north-south from the Summer Palace to Zhongshan Park, via Xizhimen and Xisi. The former was chosen due to more favorable geological foundation and greater number of government bureaus served. The second route would not be built until construction on Line&nbsp;4 began forty years later. The deterioration of relations between China and Soviet Union disrupted subway planning. Soviet experts began to leave in 1960, and were completely withdrawn by 1963.News.xinhuanet.com Id. Part 2 In 1961, the entire project was halted temporarily due to severe hardships caused by the Great Leap Forward. Eventually, planning work resumed. The route of the initial line was shifted westward to create an underground conduit to move personnel from the heart of the capital to the Western Hills. On February&nbsp;4, 1965, Chairman Mao Zedong personally approved the project.(Chinese)"地铁公司1965 -- 1970年" 地铁大事记 北京市地铁公司 2009-04-24    Construction began on July&nbsp;1, 1965, at a ceremony attended by national leaders including Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, and mayor Peng Zhen.The ceremony was not publicized at the time because the project was classified for its national security implications.  The most controversial outcome of the initial subway line was the demolition of the Beijing's historic inner city wall to make way for the subway.  Construction plans for the subway from Fuxingmen to the Beijing Railway Station called for the removal of the wall, as well as the gates and archery towers at Hepingmen, Qianmen, and Chongwenmen.  Leading architect Liang Sicheng argued for protecting the wall as a landmark of the ancient capital.  Chairman Mao favored demolishing the wall over demolishing homes.  In the end, Premier Zhou Enlai managed to preserve several walls and gates, such as the Qianmen gate and its arrow tower by slightly altering the course of the subway.北京地铁诞生记:周总理称筹建地铁是为备战 北京日报 (Part 3) Sept. 28, 2008  The initial line was completed and began trial operations in time to mark the 20th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on October&nbsp;1, 1969.The initial line, originally slated for completion by 1968, was delayed by the onset of the Cultural Revolution.  The original director of the project, General Yang Yong and much of the city government were purged in 1967. "杨勇小传(5)" in 毛泽东瞩目的著名将帅（二） (2003) It ran  from the army barracks at Fushouling to the Beijing Railway Station and had 16 stations.  This line forms parts of present-day Lines 1 and&nbsp;2.  It was the first subway to be built in China, and predates the metros of Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, San Francisco, and Washington,&nbsp;D.C., but technical problems would plague the project for the next decade. Initially, the subway hosted guest visits.  On November 11, 1969, an electrical fire killed three people, injured over 100 and destroyed two cars.  Premier Zhou Enlai placed the subway under the control of the People's Liberation Army in early 1970, but reliability problems persisted. On January&nbsp;15, 1971, the initial line began operation on a trial basis between the Beijing Railway Station and Gongzhufen.(Chinese)"地铁公司1971 -- 1980年" 地铁大事记 北京市地铁公司 2009-04-24 Single ride fare was set at ¥0.10 and only members of the public with credential letters from their work units could purchase tickets.  The line was 10.7&nbsp;km in length, had 10 stations and operated more than 60 train trips per day with a minimum wait time of 14 minutes.  On August 15, the initial line was extended to Yuquan Lu and had 13 stations over 15.6&nbsp;km.  On November 7, the line was extended again, to Gucheng Lu, and had 16 stations over 22.87&nbsp;km.  The number of trains per day rose to 100.  Overall, the line delivered 8.28&nbsp;million rides in 1971, averaging 28,000 riders per day. From 1971 to 1975, the subway was shut down for 398 days for political reasons.   On December 27, 1972, the riders no longer needed to present credential letters to purchase tickets.  In 1972, the subway delivered 15 million rides and averaged 41,000 riders per day.  In 1973, the line was extended to Pingguoyuan and reached 23.6&nbsp;km in length with 17 stations and 132 train trips per day.    The line delivered 11 million rides in 1973, averaging 54,000 riders per day. Despite its return to civilian control in 1976, the subway remained prone to closures due to fires, flooding, and accidents.  Annual ridership grew from 22.2 million in 1976 and 28.4 million in 1977 to 30.9 million in 1978, and 55.2 million in 1980. On April 20, 1981, the Beijing Subway Company, then a subsidiary of the Beijing Public Transportation Company, was organized to take over subway operations.  On September 15, 1981, the initial line passed its final inspections, and was handed over to the Beijing Subway Company, ending a decade of trial operations.(Chinese)"地铁公司1981 -- 1990年" 地铁大事记 2009-04-24  It had 19 stations and ran  from Fushouling in the Western Hills to the Beijing Railway Station.  Investment in the project totaled ¥706 million. Annual ridership rose from 64.7 million in 1981 and 72.5 million in 1982 to 82 million in 1983. On September 20, 1984, a second line was opened to the public.  This horseshoe-shaped line was created from the eastern half of the initial line and corresponds to the southern half of the present-day Line&nbsp;2.  It ran  from Fuxingmen to Jianguomen with 16 stations.  Ridership reached 105&nbsp;million in 1985. On December&nbsp;28, 1987, the two existing lines were reconfigured into Lines&nbsp;1, which ran from Pingguoyuan to Fuxingmen and Line&nbsp;2, in its current loop, tracing the Ming city wall.  Fares doubled to ¥0.20 for single-line rides and ¥0.30 for rides with transfers.  Ridership reached 307 million in 1988.  The subway was closed from June&nbsp;3–4, 1989 during the suppression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations.  In 1990, the subway carried more than one million riders per day for the first time, as total ridership reached 381 million.  After a fare hike to ¥0.50 in 1991, annual ridership declined slightly to 371 million. On January 26, 1991, planning began on the eastward extension of Line&nbsp;1 under Chang'an Avenue from Fuxingmen.  The project was funded by a 19.2 billion yen low-interest development assistance loan from Japan.(Chinese) -- 2000年"  P1:1991-1993 2009-04-24  Construction began on the eastern extension on June&nbsp;24, 1992, and the Xidan station opened on December&nbsp;12, 1992.

The full-length of Line 1 became operational on June&nbsp;28, 2000. Despite little track expansion in the early 1990s, ridership grew rapidly to reach a record high of 558 million in 1995, but fell to 444 million the next year when fares rose from ¥0.50 to ¥2.00.

On the same day, subway fares were reduced from between ¥3 and ¥7 per trip, depending on the line and number of transfers, to a single flat fare of ¥2 with unlimited transfers. The lower fare policy caused the Beijing Subway to run a deficit of ¥600 million in 2007, which was expected to widen to ¥1&nbsp;billion in 2008. The Beijing municipal government covered these deficits to encourage mass transit use, and reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.
