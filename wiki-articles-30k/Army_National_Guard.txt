   The Army National Guard (ARNG), in conjunction with the Air National Guard, are the United States federal and state military reserve force.  They are simultaneously part of two different organizations, the National Guard of the Several States, Territories and the District of Columbia (also referred to as the Militia of the United States), and the National Guard of the United States. The Army National Guard is divided into subordinate units stationed in each of the 50 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia, and operates under their respective governors.Military Reserves Federal Call Up Authority The Army National Guard as currently authorized and organized operates under Title 10 of the United States Code when under federal control, and Title 32 of the United States Code and applicable state laws when under state control. The Army National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state or territorial governors to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, as well as civil disorder. The District of Columbia Army National Guard is a federal militia, controlled by the President of the United States with authority delegated to the Secretary of Defense, and through him to the Secretary of the Army.National Archives and Records Administration, Executive Order 11485—Supervision and control of the National Guard of the District of Columbia, 1 October 1969 Members or units of the Army National Guard may be ordered, temporarily or indefinitely, into the service of the United States.10 USC 12211.

Department of Defense.) The President may also call up members and units of the Army National Guard, in its status as the militia of the several states, to repel invasion, suppress rebellion, or enforce federal laws.10 USC 12406. National Guard in Federal service: call The Army National Guard of the United States is one of two organizations administered by the National Guard Bureau, the other being the Air National Guard of the United States.  The Director of the Army National Guard is the head of the organization, and reports to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. Because the Army National Guard is both the militia of the several states and a federal reserve component of the Army, neither the Chief of the National Guard Bureau nor the Director of the Army National Guard "commands" it.  This function is performed in each state or territory by the State Adjutant General, and in the District of Columbia by the Commanding General of the District of Columbia National Guard when a unit is in its militia status.  The Chief of the National Guard Bureau and the Director of the Army National Guard serve as the channel of communications between the Department of the Army and the Army National Guard in each state and territory, and administer federal programs, policies, and resources for the National Guard.Cornell University, legal Information Institute, 10 USC § 10503 – Functions of National Guard Bureau: Charter, accessed 20 June 2013 The Army National Guard's portion of the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2015 is approximately $14 billion, including appropriations for personnel pay and allowance, facilities maintenance, construction, equipment maintenance and other activities.  Though a militia was mustered in Spanish Florida in the 1500s,Thomas Kielbasa, National Guard News, Florida Celebrates 445th Anniversary of 'First Muster', 16 September 2010 the modern Army National Guard traces its origins to 13 December 1636, the day the Massachusetts Bay Colony's General Court passed an act calling for the creation of three regiments by organizing existing separate militia companies in the towns around Boston.About the National Guard, The National Guard Website  The creation of the militia regiments was caused by the perceived need to defend the Bay Colony against American Indians, as well as colonists and military members from other European countries who were operating in North America, including: the French in what is now Canada; the Spanish in what is now Florida, The Carolinas, and  Georgia; and the Dutch in what was then New Netherland, which comprised what is now parts of New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.Thomas L. Purvis, Almanacs of American Life: Colonial America to 1763, 1999, page 41George Madison Bodge, Soldiers in King Philip's War, 1906, page 471 The General Court required that all able-bodied men between ages 16 and 60, except judges and clergy members, be considered members of the colony's militia, which was organized as the North, South, and East Regiments.  Militia members were required to equip themselves, take part in regular training, and report to their units when called. (The lineage of the North, South and East Regiments is maintained in the 21st century by: 1st Squadron, 182nd Cavalry Regiment and 1st Battalion, 181st Infantry Regiment (North); 1st Battalion, 101st Field Artillery Regiment (South); and the 101st Engineer Battalion (East).)Michael D. Doubler, The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook , 2008, page 161 The militia of the Bay Colony, combined with militias from Plymouth and Saybrook and Native American allies from the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes fought the Native Americans of Southern New England in the Pequot War (1634–1638).  This war resulted in hundreds of deaths, hundreds of Native Americans sold into slavery or scattered throughout North America, and the destruction of the Pequots as a group.Faren R. Siminoff, Crossing the Sound: The Rise of Atlantic American Communities in Eastern Long Island, 2004, page 63Alfred A. Cave, The Pequot War, 1996, page 11 The militias of the Southern New England colonies fought Native Americans again in King Philip's War from 1675 to 1676.  This conflict led to the decisive defeat of the Narragansets, further straining relationships between Native Americans and white Europeans, but enabling continued white settlement of New England.Stanley Sandler, editor, Ground Warfare: An International Encyclopedia, H-Q, 2002, pages 464–465 The American colonists maintained their militias in the late 1600s and 1700s, preferring the militia to a standing army as the result of English experience with a standing army when Oliver Cromwell established a military dictatorship during the First English Civil War.  In addition, the colonists had little interest in paying the taxes to maintain permanent garrisons of British troops.James A. Wood, Militia Myths: Ideas of the Canadian Citizen Soldier, 1896–1921, 2010, page 5A. Ward Burian, George Washington's Legacy of Leadership, 2007, page 120Peter M. Karsten, The Military in America, 1986, page 59 The militias were also an early experiment in democracy, with company grade officers often elected by their men, and the higher officers appointed by colonial governors or legislatures.  The colonies did not exert centralized control over the militias or coordinate their efforts.  Training typically took place during musters each summer, with militia members reporting for inspection and undergoing several days of training in drill and ceremony.Barry M. Stentiford, The Richardson Light Guard of Wakefield, Massachusetts, 2013, page 18René Chartrand, Colonial American Troops, 1610–1774, Volume 2, 2002, page 23Spencer C. Tucker, The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607–1890, 2011, page 498 During the French and Indian War, militias from several British colonies took part in various actions, including: Many leaders of both British and American forces during the American Revolution had military experience in the French and Indian War, including American militia veterans Washington, Israel Putnam,Spencer C.

Shelton, Ruben Garcia, General Richard Montgomery and the American Revolution: From Redcoat to Rebel, 1996, page 69    When tensions escalated between the British government and the American colonists in the 1760s and 1770s, many citizens began organizing, equipping and training private militia units, in order to have bodies of troops that were outside the control of the royal governors.Lynn Hunt, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, Bonnie G. Smith, The Making of the West: A Concise History, Volume II: Peoples and Cultures, 2010, page 593 Militia members served throughout the Revolution, often near their homes, and frequently for short periods.  Militia units served in combat, as well as carrying out guard duty for prisoners, garrisoning of forts, and local patrols.Edward Ayres, Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, The Role of the Militia During the Revolutionary War, accessed 12 June 2013Michael D. Doubler, The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook, 2008, page 48 On some occasions, militia members performed ineffectively, as at the Battle of Camden in North Carolina.Roger Chickering, Stig Förster, editors, War in an Age of Revolution, 1775–1815, 2010, pages 161–162  On other occasions they performed capably, including the Battles of Lexington and Concord,Dale Anderson, Lexington and Concord: 19 April 1775, 2004, page 22 Battle of Bunker Hill,George D. Bennett, editor, The United States Army: Issues, Background and Bibliography, 2002, page 1 Battle of Bennington,Joseph C. Morton, The American Revolution, 2003, page 56 Battles of Saratoga,Joseph J. Ellis, His Excellency: George Washington, 2004 and Battle of Cowpens.Ian R. Barnes, The Historical Atlas of the American Revolution, 2000, page 112 Perhaps the most important role played by the militia was off the battlefield, by affecting the course of the political debate.  Militia with Patriot sympathies was well established, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic and New England colonies, causing the British Army to concentrate their forces into larger, more defensible garrisons.  With the countryside in the hands of the Patriot militia, neutrals or Loyalists gradually either fled to British garrisons (and from there, often to Canada) or became more accepting of the Patriot goal of independence from Great Britain.Bulliet, Crossley, Headrick, Hirsch, Johnson, Northrup, editors, The Earth and its Peoples A Global History, Volume II, 2008, page 645Robert Bothwell, A Traveller's History of Canada, 2001, page 31Stanley J. Underdal, editor, Military History of the American Revolution: The Proceedings of the Sixth Military History Symposium, U.S. Air Force Academy, 2002, page 93 During the period of the Articles of Confederation, the weak federal government reduced the Continental Army to a handful of officers and soldiers.  The Articles of Confederation required each state to maintain a militia, and allowed the Confederation Congress to form a standing army only with the consent of nine of the thirteen states.  Such consent was not forthcoming in an era when the population still harbored a distrust of a standing army, so Congress largely left the defense of the new nation to the state militias.Keith L. Dougherty, Collective Action Under the Articles of Confederation, 2006, page 31 During the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Federalist delegates argued for a powerful federal government, including federal control of the militia.  Federalists anticipated using the military to defend the country if it were attacked, and to enforce federal laws when required.Gordon S. Wood, Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789–1815, 2009, page 111 Anti-Federalists advocated limited federal government, and wanted continued state control over the militias.  Anti-Federalists based their arguments on three points.  First, the militia could be available to the federal government to resist foreign invasions. Second, the militia served as a police force in each state, enabling it to maintain order and respect for the law.  Third, once the new federal government replaced the one under the Articles of Confederation, the militia would be the last defense of the states in the event that a standing army raised by the federal government was employed against the states.Jack P. Greene, J. R. Pole, editors, A Companion to the American Revolution, 2008, pages 385–386 The compromise agreed to by both sides satisfied Anti-Federalists because there was no standing Army, and the militias remained the responsibility of the states, especially the appointment of officers.  It satisfied the Federalists because it provided that the militia could be federalized when circumstances required it.Christopher Patrick Gibson, Securing the State: Reforming the National Security Decisionmaking Process, 2008, page 90 The compromise between Federalists and Anti-federalists proved short-lived.  In 1791 Arthur St. Clair suffered a major defeat in the Battle of the Wabash while fighting American Indians in the Northwest Territory.  In response, Congress authorized the expansion of the Army, and allowed for the President to call up the state militias on his own authority if circumstances required it when Congress was not in session.Spencer C. Tucker, Almanac of American Military History, 2012, page 412 The First Militia Act of 1792 allowed the President to call up the militias in the event of a foreign invasion, in response to attacks by American Indians, and when required for the enforcement of federal law.Robert W. Coakley, The Role of Federal Military Forces in Domestic Disorders, 1789–1878, 1996, pages 19–20 The Second Militia Act of 1792 formalized the organization and training requirements of the state militias.  It mandated that the militia consisted of every "free able-bodied white male citizen" between ages 18 and 45, organized as members of a local unit. (A later change expanded eligibility to all men between 18 and 54, regardless of race.)  Some occupations were exempt, including stagecoach drivers and ferry operators, who would be expected to support the militia by facilitating the transport of soldiers, supplies and equipment in the event of a mobilization.  There were also religious exemptions for Quakers and other denominations that advocated nonviolence.Carl Benn, Daniel Marston, Fred Anderson, Liberty Or Death: Wars That Forged a Nation, 2006, pages 187–188South Carolina Historical Society, South Carolina Historical Magazine, Volumes 68–69, 1967, page 27 Militia units were required to report for training twice a year, usually in early Summer (after Spring planting) and late Fall (after the Autumn harvest but before snow fell).  Militia members were required to outfit themselves and report for training or mobilization with a musket or rifle, bayonet, flints, cartridge box, bullets or musket balls, haversack or knapsack, and powder horn and gunpowder.Carl Edward Skeen, 1816: America Rising, 2003, page 135 State legislatures were authorized to organize local units into divisions, regiments and subordinate commands, and federalized militia members were made subject to court martial proceedings for disobeying orders and other offenses.South Carolina State Legislature, The Militia System of South Carolina, 1838, pages 35 to 40 Part of this reorganization included removing state governors as commanders with military rank (Captain General), and the creation of the state Adjutant General.  The Adjutant General reported directly to the governor and served as commander of the state militia.Michael D. Doubler, The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook, 2008, page 21  States were slow to respond, and some did not begin appointing Adjutants General until after the War of 1812. President George Washington used the authority of the Second Act in 1794 to call up the militia in response to the Whiskey Rebellion.  He did so shortly before that provision of the Second Act was about to expire.  Recognizing that the authority might be needed again in the future, Congress responded by passing the Militia Act of 1795, which made permanent the President's ability to call up the militia on his own authority if Congress was not in session.James C. Bradford, editor, A Companion to American Military History, Volume 1, 2010, page 477Stephen C. Neff, Justice in Blue and Gray: A Legal History of the Civil War, 2010, page 52 The use of the militia in the Whiskey Rebellion made clear that at that point, militias were not well organized, effectively trained, or capably led.  Washington and other Federalists advocated the creation of a national military academy to standardize training and increase the number of citizens with military experience, and in 1802, the Army established the United States Military Academy at West Point.Paul T. Hellmann, Historical Gazetteer of the United States, 2013, page 800Spencer C. Tucker, Almanac of American Military History, 2012, page 440   At the start of the War of 1812 the regular army totaled less than 12,000 soldiers.  Congress authorized expanding the army to 35,000, but recruiting was only moderately successful because of poor pay and a lack of trained leaders.David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T. Heidler, The War of 1812, 2002, page 45  In addition, war with England was less popular in some areas of the country than others, which made it difficult to convince men to enlist.  For example, in Vermont residents saw little need to fight the British in the dominion of Canada, which was a profitable trading partner.David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T. Heidler, editors, Encyclopedia of the War of 1812, 2004, pages 534–535 Both regular and hastily organized militias took part in battles throughout the war, with mixed results.  For example, the militia fled during the Battle of Bladensburg, giving rise to the description of the event as the "Bladensburg races."Jeremy Black, War in the Modern World Since 1815, 2003, page 116  On the other hand, less than three weeks later the Maryland militia won a strategic victory at the Battle of North Point.Michael D. Doubler, The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook, 2008, page 186  Alexander Macomb also led a successful action at Plattsburgh, with his small force of regulars and militia defeating a British attempt to invade upstate New York from Canada.John Livingston, Biographical sketches of distinguished Americans now living, 1853, page 24  In addition, Andrew Jackson employed militia effectively at the Battle of New Orleans.Richard Winship Stewart, American Military History, Volume I, 2005, page 159 In some cases militia members objected to serving outside their home states, arguing that since they were responsible to their state governors and not the federal government, they were not required to serve in other states or take part in invasions.Diane Smolinski, Henry Smolinski, Battles of the War of 1812, 2003, page 13  Also, some state governors attempted to prevent their militias from being federalized, since they did not support the war.David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T. Heidler, editors, Encyclopedia of the War of 1812, 2004, page 349  (The 1827 decision in the case of Martin v. Mott determined that governors could not interfere with the president's authority to call upon the militia to execute federal law, suppress insurrection and repel invasion.  Jacob Mott, a New York militia member, refused James Madison's order to mobilize and refused to pay the fine levied by a subsequent court-martial.  Martin, a United States Marshal, then seized Mott's property.  Mott sued to recover his property and won in state court.  Martin then took the case to the United States Supreme Court and prevailed.)Kermit L. Hall, James W. Ely, Joel B. Grossman , editors, The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States, 2005, page 615 One result of the uneven performance of the militia, the lingering uncertainty over the willingness of militia troops to fight for causes that were unpopular locally, and the unresolved question of state versus federal control of the militia, was that the federal government was wary of attempting to federalize the militia during future conflicts.  In the wake of the War of 1812, the federal government attempted to standardize training and laws governing call up and mobilization for militia organizations throughout the United States. These efforts to reenergize the militia lapsed as the result of the long period of relative peace that followed the War of 1812.  (The Era of Good Feelings.)   The number of occupations exempt from membership increased, and annual muster days became more picnic and parade than military formation.  These factors, coupled with a lack of military leaders with training and experience, led to a gradual decline of the militia.Carl Edward Skeen, Citizen Soldiers in the War of 1812, 1999, page 178 Despite this decline, the militia was still called to action on occasion, including the Black Hawk War of 1832.James Lewis, Ph.D., Northern Illinois University, Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project, The Black Hawk War of 1832, 2000 The first use of the term "National Guard" by American militia units dates from Lafayette's 1824–1825 tour of the United States.  The 2nd Battalion of the 11th New York Artillery – which later became New York's famed 7th Regiment – was one the units that welcomed Lafayette to New York City, and it adopted the title "National Guard" in honor of Lafayette's service as commander of the Garde Nationale de Paris during the French Revolution.  During a review of militia units Lafayette took note of the term, and as it grew in popularity it was adopted by many militia units in the years that followed.Potter's American Monthly, The Seventh Regiment, National Guard, Volume 3, October 1874, pages 467–468   In the United States in the mid-1840s, war with Mexico had the support of Southern Democrats and their allies in the north, who were anxious to annex Texas and gain states that would permit slavery, while Northern Whigs and anti-slavery Democrats generally opposed the war because they did not support the extension of slavery.Peter P. Hinks, John R. McKivigan, R. Owen Williams, editors, Encyclopedia of Antislavery and Abolition: J-Z, 2007, page 471  At the start of the war, the Army consisted of between 8,000 and 9,000 soldiers.Public Broadcasting System, The U.S.-Mexican War: A Call to Arms, 2006  Enthusiasm for the war, primarily in the south, spurred renewed interest in the militia, and membership began to grow. The regular Army did not consider militia members to be reliable, and the issue of whether militia units could be employed outside the United States had not been resolved.  As a result, Congress expanded the Army by authorizing the creation of ten regiments and the recruiting of 50,000 "volunteers"—individuals who were not in the regular Army and were not militia members subject to state control.Spencer C. Tucker, The Encyclopedia of the Mexican–American War, 2012, page 548  In many cases, militia units volunteered for federal service en masse, and usually continued to be led by their militia officers.Arnold L. Punaro, Commission on the National Guard and Reserves: Transforming the National Guard and Reserves Into a 21st Century Operational Force, 2008, page 386John C. Pinheiro, Manifest Ambition: James K. Polk and Civil–Military Relations During the Mexican War, 2007, page 38 In the war, approximately 27,000 regular Army soldiers saw active service, as did an estimated 73,000 volunteers and militiamen.Fumio Matsuo, Democracy with a Gun: America and the Policy of Force, 2010, page 205 Mexican–American War participants who were militia veterans included: Franklin Pierce;Marsh, Capen and Lyon, The New Hampshire Register and Farmer's Almanac, 1834, page 76 Jefferson Davis;William J.

President Lincoln summoned 75,000 militia on 15 April 1861 to suppress the insurrection, a call which was limited by law to 90 days and which was rejected by several slaveholding states which had not seceded.  In May 1861, Lincoln put out a call for more militia as well as volunteers who would be willing to serve for three years.  The Union's July 1861 advance on Manassas, which resulted in defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run was due in large part to the fast-approaching expiration of the initial 90-day militia call-up—the Lincoln administration and Union Army leaders wanted to employ them before they mustered out.  The resulting Union loss occurred at the hands of a Confederate force which was also principally composed of militia.Andrew Cunningham McLaughlin, Albert Bushnell Hart, editors, Cyclopedia of American Government, Volume 2, 1914, page 440John George Nicolay, A Short Life of Abraham Lincoln, Volume 1, 2008, pages 272–273William Corby, Memoirs of Chaplain Life, 1893, pages 17–18Bill Fawcett, How to Lose the Civil War: Military Mistakes of the War Between the States, 2011, page 19 The Union used a version of the Mexican–American War-era volunteer system to expand the size of the Union Army while avoiding the restrictions on how long the militia could be employed.  Many militia units were enlisted en masse, and many individuals who enlisted or received commissions in the Union Army were militia veterans.Duane E. Shaffer, Men of Granite: New Hampshire's Soldiers in the Civil War, 2008, page 20 State Adjutants General and the military staffs of the state governors in the Union were often responsible for equipping, training and transporting recruits and draftees to front line units.Howard Coffin, Nine Months to Gettysburg, 2011, Chapter 2  In addition, militias often garrisoned forts, performed local defense and border security patrols, and guarded prisoners.Michael D. Doubler, John W. Listman, Jr., The National Guard: An Illustrated History of America's Citizen Soldiers, 2007, page 40 On several occasions, local militia became involved in larger battles, such as the Pennsylvania, New York and Rhode Island militia responding during the Gettysburg Campaign, and the militia of several southern states during Sherman's March to the Sea.MDoubler and Listman, Jr., page 41Greenwood Press, The Greenwood Library of American War Reporting: The Civil War, North and South, 2005, page 244 The Confederate States Army also frequently enlisted militia unit members as a group, and many individuals who joined the CSA were militia veterans.Harlan H. Hinkle, Grayback Mountaineers: The Confederate Face Of Western Virginia, 2003, page 46 The Confederate states also used their militias for local duty in much the same way as the Union.Michael D. Doubler, The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook, 2008, page 51 Union veterans of the militia who had leadership roles during the war included George J. Stannard.Paul G. Zeller, The Second Vermont Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 1861–1865, 2009, page 8 Chester A. Arthur, who served on the staff of the Governor of New York as Quartermaster with the rank of Brigadier General, played a key role in outfitting New York soldiers and transporting them to the front lines.Emma Rogers, Chester A. Arthur: Man and President, 1921, pages 7–8 Prominent Confederate militia veterans included Braxton Bragg,Clayton Rand, Sons of the South, 1961, page 119 who was a Colonel in the Louisiana Militia at the start of the war, and Sterling Price, who commanded the Missouri State Guard.Randy R. McGuire, St. Louis Arsenal: Armory of the West, 2001, page 94  In 1867, Congress suspended the right of each former Confederate state to organize its militia until it resumed normal functions as part of the United States,Michael T. Geary, Sweet Land of Security, 2007, page 57 and the U.S. Army enforced martial law during ReconstructionJeffrey A. Weber, Johan Eliasson, editors, Handbook of Military Administration, 2007, page 224 and guarded polls during the presidential election of 1876.Peter B. Kraska, editor, Militarizing the American Criminal Justice System, 2001, page 31  In addition to enforcing federal law in the south, the Army was used to suppress labor unrest in the North, as during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.Clayton D. Laurie, Ronald H. Cole, The Role of Federal Military Forces in Domestic Disorders, 1877–1945, 1997, page 29  In response Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act in 1878, which limited the president's ability to employ the military within the United States during peacetime without the consent of Congress.Seth Lipsky, The Citizen's Constitution: An Annotated Guide, 2011, page 150James B. Jacobs, Socio-Legal Foundations of Civil-Military Relations, 1986, page 61Jethro Koller Lieberman, A Practical Companion to the Constitution, 1999, page 360 Governors could still employ the militia during labor strikes or civil disturbances, and concern over the militia's increased use for this function led states to revise their militia laws and reorganize their units in order to be better prepared to respond to such events.Robin Archer, Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?, 2010, page 122Scott Reynolds Nelson, A Nation of Deadbeats: An Uncommon History of America's Financial Disasters, 2013, page 179Aaron Brenner, Benjamin Day, Immanuel Ness, The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History, 2011, page 486Louis S. Warren, Buffalo Bill's America, 2007, page 267 In 1861 Connecticut was the first state to formally adopt the title "National Guard" for its militia, and the term became near universal following the Civil War.Michael D. Doubler, The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook, 2008, page 51  By the time the National Defense Act of 1916 mandated the use of "National Guard" as the title for all organized militia, only Virginia had not already adopted it.Bruce Jacobs, National Guard magazine, "The National Guard: By Any Other Name?", September 1980, page 48  In the Spanish–American War, the U.S. government again used the volunteer concept to expand the Army without directly addressing the question of when militia could be federalized. As had happened previously, there were militia units that volunteered and were enlisted en masse, as well as individual militia members who joined volunteer units. Examples of the units that volunteered as a group include the 69th New York Infantry and the 71st New York Infantry.New York Adjutant General, New York in the Spanish–American War 1898, 1900, Volume 3, page 1New York State Military Museum, 71st Regiment Infantry, New York Volunteers, Spanish-American War, 2011 The most famous organization of volunteers to fight in the war, the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, or "Rough Riders," was organized in part from the New Mexico and Arizona National Guards. Originally commanded by regular Army officer Leonard Wood with former New York National Guardsman Theodore Roosevelt as second in command, it came under Roosevelt's leadership when Wood was promoted to command of a brigade.Michael Dale Doubler, John W. Listman, Jr, The National Guard: An Illustrated History of Americas Citizen-soldiers, 2007, page 48Theodore Roosevelt, The Rough Riders, 1899, page 291   The official founding of the modern Army National Guard is often credited to passage of the Militia Act of 1903, which established a pattern that would continue throughout the 20th century of providing increasing federal resources and wartime relevance of the militia in return for increasing federal controls over their arming, organization and training. Also called the Dick Act, for sponsor Charles W. F. Dick, The 1903 law updated the Militia Act of 1792, though it left unresolved the key question of how to compel service of the militia outside the borders of the United States, which did not fall under the Constitutionally permitted uses of the militia "to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrection and repel invasions."Janice E. McKenney, The organizational history of field artillery 1775–2003, 2007, page 105 This fundamental restriction on the use of the militia had been an unresolved dilemma for military planners since the War of 1812.  This uncertainty led the federal government to bypass the state militias in favor of creating volunteer armies, as was done for the Mexican–American War, the Union Army of the American Civil War, and the U.S. forces raised for the Spanish–American War – though in each of these cases, the volunteer forces raised came largely from already existing militia companies.  While the Dick Act did not compel the militia to serve overseas, the expectation was that the increase in federal funding and training would spur increased volunteerism by militia members in the event of a war. The Dick Act provided that states which wished to receive federal funding for their militia units had to organize their units according to standards dictated by the regular Army, and that National Guard members would have to meet the same training, education and readiness standards as their regular Army counterparts. In exchange, the federal government provided states with funding and equipment to enable militia reorganization and modernization, as well as training by regular Army officers should a governor request it. The Dick Act required that all members of National Guard units attend 24 four-hour drill periods during the course of each year (which were not paid for by the federal government) as well as 5 days of training at summer encampments (for which the federal government provided pay at the same rate as for soldiers in the regular Army).Jerold E. Brown, Historical Dictionary of the United States Army, 2001, page 146Jeffrey Lehman, Shirelle Phelps, West's encyclopedia of American Law, Volume 7, 2005, page 178Allan R. Millett, Peter Maslowski, For the Common Defense, 2012 The Dick Act also authorized creation of an office to oversee and coordinate the activities of the state militias.  In response, the Army created the Militia Section within the Miscellaneous Division of the Adjutant General's office, staffed by Major James Parker and four clerks.Baltimore Sun, Division of Militia Begins: New Army Department In Charge Of Major James Parker, 3 February 1903  This office became the Division of Militia Affairs in 1908, and Erasmus M. Weaver, Jr. was named to head it.Boston Globe, Now a Full Colonel: Lieut Col E. M. Weaver, Given Advancement; Well Known in Massachusetts and Chief of Militia Affairs, 5 December 1909Jim Greenhill, Armed Forces Press Service, National Defense Authorization Act Empowers National Guard, 2 February 2008 Passed as part of the Preparedness Movement during and after the Villa expedition and before U.S. entry into World War I, the 1916 law named the state militias as the Army's primary reserve.  The law also created a mechanism for involuntary mobilization of the National Guard for service outside the borders of the U.S. by stating that members of the militia would be drafted en masse into the Army in the event of an emergency, thus severing their tie to the states and the restrictions placed on usage of state militia.  Officers and men were also required to swear an oath to serve both state and federal authorities.  In addition, the law made mandatory the use of the term "National Guard" to describe the organized militia, and provided funding to pay members for attending drill.  The act also increased the number of weekend or weeknight drills from 24 to 48 per year, and increased the annual training period from five days to 15.  Federal funding of all aspects of the National Guard expanded dramatically as a result of this legislation, with the federal government taking over all arming, equipping and training expenses associated with the Guard, sharing only administrative and armory costs with the states.  Prior to 1916, the states in aggregate spent more on the militia than the federal government.  Since 1916, federal expenditures have far outpaced those of the states.Barry M. Stentiford, The American Home Guard: The State Militia in the Twentieth Century, 2002, pages 19–20Jerold E. Brown, Historical Dictionary of the U.S. Army, 2001, page 40Jerry Cooper, The Rise of the National Guard: The Evolution of the American Militia, 1865–1920, 2002, page 171-172 The 1916 law also created the Reserve Officer Training Corps.History Channel, 3 June 1916, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson signs National Defense Act, 2013 The 1916 Act also reorganized the Division of Militia Affairs within the Army as the Militia Bureau, removing it from the General Staff and elevating it to a position directly under the Secretary of War.  It also authorized the two members of the National Guard to serve on active duty as assistants to the Chief of the Militia Bureau, the first National Guardsmen to be authorized to serve as members of the Army staff.Institute for Government Research, The Development of National Administrative Organization in the United States, 1923, page 253Jim Little, Fathers of the Greatest Generation, 2012, page 18New York Times, Militiamen Draft a New Army Bill, 27 February 1916  Numerous National Guard units were activated for service on the Mexico–United States border during the Pancho Villa Expedition.Mitchell Yockelson, The United States Armed Forces and the Mexican Punitive Expedition, Prologue Magazine, National Archives and Records Administration, Fall 1997  Many future leaders of both the National Guard and regular Army served in the National Guard during this event, including: John F.

Walsh.Georgina Pell Curtis, Benedict Elder, editors, The American Catholic Who's Who, Volumes 7, 1947, page 449   In the spring of 1917, the U.S. declared war on Germany and entered World War I, and the National Guard played a major role.  Its units were federalized and organized into divisions by state, which made up 40% of American Expeditionary Forces combat strength.  Three of the first five U.S. Army divisions in combat were National Guard divisions, and the division with the highest number of Medals of Honor recipients was the National Guard's 30th Division.  Six of the eight U.S. divisions rated "superior" or "excellent" by the German General Staff during the war were National Guard divisions.Van Lee, Vin Rouge, Vin Blanc, Beaucoup Vin, the American Expeditionary Force in WWI, 2004, page 9 National Guard divisions in World War I included the 26th; 27th; 28th; 29th; 30th; 31st; 32nd; 33rd; 34th; 35th; 36th; 37th; 38th; 39th; 40th; 41st; and 42nd.  Most divisions initially came from one state or region, but the 42nd Division was made up of National Guard units not already assigned to other divisions, and included representation from 26 states and the District of Columbia.New River Notes, Grayson County Virginia, Heritage Foundation Inc., Order of Battle – American Forces – World War I, accessed 17 June 2013Rainbow Division Veterans Memorial Foundation, Home page, 2013 National Guard participants in World War I included: future President Harry S. Truman, who commanded Battery D, 129th Field Artillery, a unit of the 35th Infantry Division;Army Historical Foundation, National Museum of the United States Army, Captain Harry S. Truman, Missouri Army National Guard, 2013 and William J. Donovan, who received the Medal of Honor as commander of the 42nd Division's 1st Battalion, 165th Infantry Regiment (the federalized designation of New York's 69th Infantry Regiment).Central Intelligence Agency, William J. Donovan and the National Security, 1993 African American National Guardsmen participated in World War I as they had in America's other conflicts.  Three of the four regiments which made up the 93rd Division were National Guardsmen, including New York's 15th Infantry, which was federalized as the 369th Infantry Regiment.  The 369th fought as part of the French 16th Division, and the entire regiment received the Croix de guerre, with 171 members receiving the Legion of Honor.  In one of the most well known acts of heroism in the war, 369th soldiers Henry Johnson and Needham Roberts fought off a German patrol of at least 24 soldiers, for which Johnson received the Medal of Honor in 2015. Advocated by National Guard proponents including John McAuley Palmer,Michael D. Doubler, The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook, 2008, page 152 the National Defense Act of 1920 mandated that the Chief of the National Guard Bureau would be a National Guard officer, and the first Guard officer to serve as Chief was George C. Rickards.Grenville Clark, editor, National Service magazine, January, 1921, page 148  It also enabled National Guard officers to serve on the Army's general staff in addition to the Militia Bureau, reorganized the National Guard's divisions and subordinate commands, and provided federal funding for National Guard unit operating expenses.John Kennedy Ohl, Minuteman: The Military Career of General Robert S. Beightler, 2001, page 47 The National Defense Act of 1933 provided that the National Guard is considered a component of the Army at all times.  Beginning with this law, each National Guard member has two military statuses—a member of the National Guard of his or her state, or a member of the National Guard of the United States when ordered into active duty.  This enhanced the 1916 Act's mobilization provisions, making it possible to deploy National Guard units and individual members directly for overseas service in the event of a war, without having to draft them first.Jeffrey A. Jacobs, The Future of the Citizen-Soldier Force: Issues and Answers, 1994, pages 39–40Wisconsin Secretary of State, Wisconsin Blue Book, 1993, page 483 The 1933 law also changed the name of the Militia Bureau to the National Guard Bureau.Michael D. Doubler, The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook, 2008, page 58 In August 1940, the National Guard was ordered to federal service for 12 months in anticipation of U.S, entry into World War II.  More than 400,000 National Guardsmen were called up as parts of divisions or in non-divisional units, immediately doubling the size of the Army.  18 Army divisions, 80 separate regiments, and 29 Army Air Force flying squadrons were mobilized from National Guard organizations beginning in September 1940.John B. Wilson, Center of Military History, United States Army, Maneuver and Firepower: The Evolution of Divisions and Separate Brigades, 1998, page 153  After the United States officially entered the war in December 1941, one entirely new division (the Americal) and parts of several other Army divisions were organized with National Guard units.Michael D. Doubler, The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook, 2008, page 60Curtis P. Donnell, Associated Press, Lewiston Morning Tribune, Americal Division Unique Among Combat Units, 31 December 1945 Because National Guard units had been mobilized for over a year in December 1941, they were among the first to enter combat in the following months.  California's 251st Coast Artillery and Hawaii's 298th Infantry took part in the defense of Oahu on 7 December 1941, during Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor.Bill McWilliams, Sunday in Hell: Pearl Harbor, Minute by Minute, 2011, page 146  New Mexico's 200th Coast Artillery and two tank battalions made up of National Guard units from several states were part of the defense of the Philippines, with more than half of these men dying as prisoners of war of the Japanese.Lewiston Daily Sun, Manila Bay Forts, 22 April 1942United Press International, Pittsburgh Press, 1876 From New Mexico Were in Philippines, 21 February 1944Associated Press, Toledo Blade, Head of Infamous Camp Given Life, 21 November 1947 North Dakota's 164th Infantry, sent to reinforce the Marines on Guadalcanal in October 1942, was the first U.S. Army regiment to fight on the offensive in World War II.Karen Herzog, Bismarck Tribune, Book on the 164th unveiled Monday, 4 April 2010  On New Guinea, the 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions became the first Army divisions to engage and defeat the Japanese in late 1942 and early 1943.Youngstown Vindicator, Japs Lose Third Transport at Lae, 8 January 1943  In Europe, the 34th Infantry was one of the first two US infantry divisions to fight in the European theater when it landed in Algeria as part of Operation Torch.James M.

Wing and Robert S. Beightler remained in command of their divisions, the 43rd and 37th, and Beightler was the only National Guard general to command his division for the entire duration of the war.Ohio Historical Society, The Pacific: General Beightler and the Buckeye Division, 17 May 2010Rutland Herald, In the fall of 1945, Maj.

In addition it replaced the Secretary of War with the Secretary of the Army.  It also removed the Army Secretary and Secretary of the Navy from the cabinet and placed their departments within the Department of Defense.Jerold E. Brown, Historical Dictionary of the United States Army, 2001, page 333 The 1947 Act also created the United States Air Force as a military service separate from the United States Army, of which it had been part since before World War I.Richard I. Wolf, Office of Air Force History, The United States Air Force: Basic Documents on Roles and Missions, 1987, page 61 As a result of the Air Force's creation, the Air National Guard was formed.Sydney Morning Herald, National Air Guard: New U.S. Reserve, 6 May 1946The Southeast Missourian, New Air Reserve Draws AAF Vets, 20 August 1946  Under the control of the governors during peacetime, the Air Guard was organized along the same lines as the Army National Guard, as both a militia existing in each of the states, and as a federal reserve component of the US Air Force.  The fielding of the Air National Guard also caused the creation of two new positions within the National Guard Bureau, the Director of the Army National Guard and Director of the Air National Guard, who each reported to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau.W.A.R. Robertson, The Air National Guard, Flying Magazine, August 1948, page 18Americana Corporation, Yearbook of the Encyclopedia Americana, 1949, page xxvi The post-World War II reorganization of the National Guard was an emphasis on the creation of numerous Infantry and Armor divisions, oriented on a Cold War scenario that presumed large numbers of soldiers and tanks would be needed to stop an invasion of Western Europe by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Hanson W. Baldwin, New York Times, NATION'S ARMED FORCES FACING WIDE EXPANSION, 27 June 1948  (See Legacy units and formations.)  President Harry S. Truman mobilized the National Guard for the Korean War.  Four infantry divisions were activated—the 28th; 40th; 43rd; and 45th.  The 40th and 45th served in Korea, while the 28th and 43rd deployed to West Germany as part of the Cold War deterrent to an invasion by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Paul M. Edwards, Korean War Almanac, 2006, page 86 By the end of the war, approximately 700 Army National Guard units had been mobilized, as had thousands of individual volunteers and soldiers involuntarily called to active duty because they had critical skills.  Approximately 139,000 Army Guardsmen served during this conflict.New Jersey National Guard, Fact sheet, Korean War, page 1, accessed 13 June 2013 In 1959 it was decided to realign National Guard and Army Reserve divisions under the Pentomic structures. A controversy immediately surfaced over the required number of divisions. Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy decided on 27 National Guard formations. By September 1959 the twenty-one infantry and six armored divisions in the Guard had reorganized. Non-divisional regimental combat teams were eliminated and replaced with separate combined arms brigades. Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Arizona organized the 29th, 92nd and 258th Infantry Brigades. In the 1962-63 Reorganization Objective Army Division reorganization, the 34th, 35th, 43rd, and 51st Infantry Divisions, multi-state National Guard formations, dropped out of the force.Maneuver and Firepower, 312, 314. They were in part replaced by the 67th (Nebraska and Iowa), 69th (Kansas and Missouri), 86th (Vermont and Connecticut), and 53rd Infantry Brigades (Florida and South Carolina). Each brigade fielded five maneuver battalions or squadrons. The following year, to increase flexibility, the 53rd and 86th Infantry Brigades were converted to armor (53rd and 86th Armored Brigades), and the 67th Infantry Brigade was reorganized as mechanized infantry. The 53rd and 67th retained their five maneuver battalions, but the 86th lost one.  During the Vietnam War the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson decided upon a draft to enhance active duty troop strength rather than calling on large numbers of the National Guard and Reserves.New York Times, No Reserve Call: Additional Troops Will Be Sent as Needed, President Says, 29 July 1965  As a result, membership in a reserve component, including the Army National Guard, became a way to avoid combat service in an unpopular war.Associated Press, Oxnard Press-Courier, Queries Answered on Draft Changes, 14 March 1967United Press International, Lexington Dispatch, Guard Units Told to Shun Draft Dodgers, 1 December 1967  Amid accusations of favoritism in enlistment and "easy" service when compared to duty in Vietnam, the reputation of the Army National Guard declined even as enlistments increased.Associated Press, Toledo Blade, Reserve, Guard Drill Crackdown Set, 2 May 1966 Despite the decision not to call up the National Guard in full force, some units were activated, and individual National Guard members volunteered to be mobilized.  Among the Army National Guard units mobilized during the Vietnam War were Artillery battalions from Kentucky and New Hampshire, and an Engineer company from Vermont.  Company D (Long Range Patrol) 151st Infantry Regiment, Indiana Army National Guard, was the only National Guard Infantry unit to serve in Vietnam.John Listman, National Guard Educational Foundation, Indiana Rangers in Vietnam, accessed 25 July 2013  Overall, between 12,000 and 13,000 Army National Guard members were activated for the Vietnam War, either as individual volunteers or in units.National Guard Educational Foundation, Army National Guard Units Mobilized in Vietnam War, 2011 The National Guard was also activated to quell numerous civil disturbances, including anti-Vietnam War protests and urban riots.Sarasota Journal, National Guard Keeps Shaky Peace in Rochester, 27 July 1964St. Petersburg Times, National Guard Division Mobilized: Los Angeles Riots Out of Control, 14 August 1965Austin Scott, Associated Press, Lewiston Sun, Guard Occupies Miami Riot Area After Two Slain, 9 August 1968  The most notable of these was the May, 1970 event at Kent State University, at which four students were killed and nine wounded by members of the Ohio Army National Guard.The Age, Suddenly, They Turned and Fired, 6 May 1970St. Petersburg Times, Guard Disputes report on Kent, 25 July 1970Milwaukee Journal, Grand Jury Clears Guard, Indicts 25 in Kent Case, 16 October 1970 During the Vietnam War era the National Guard maintained its role as an organization available to governors for disaster relief.New York Times, Ohio Flood Waters Recede, 26 May 1968Spokane Daily Chronicle, 13 New Fires Erupt, 23 August 1967  The Army's experience with not having fully used the National Guard during the Vietnam War led to the creation of the 1973 Total Force Policy.  With the Vietnam War draft having been ended in favor of an all volunteer military, the Total Force Policy required all active and reserve military organizations to be treated as a single integrated force.  Following the experience of fighting in Vietnam without widespread popular support, the TFP was designed to involve the American public in military actions by mobilizing the National Guard from its thousands of locations throughout the United States.Richard Winship Stewart, editor, American Military History: The United States Army in a Global Era, 1917–2003, 2005, pages 376–377 In 1974 the "Abrams Doctrine" further expanded the TFP.  Creighton Abrams, who had become commander of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam in 1968, became Chief of Staff of the United States Army in 1972.  Having seen the effects of President Johnson's decision to use the draft rather than calling on the National Guard and Reserve in large numbers, Abrams stated that the U.S. should never again go to war without calling up the Guard and Reserve.John T. Correll, Origins of the Total Force, Air Force Magazine, February, 2011  For much of the final decades of the twentieth century, National Guard personnel typically served "One weekend a month, two weeks a year", with a portion working for the Guard in a full-time capacity as members of the Active Guard Reserve (AGR) or as dual status federal technicians.  (Dual status technicians are traditional National Guard members who are federal civilian employees during the regular work week, and work in uniform.) As part of the Reagan Era defense build up, the National Guard began to transform from a strategic reserve to an operational one.  This included modernization of equipment and weapons, more intensive training during drill and annual training periods, and increased overseas training opportunities.Associated Press, Waycross Journal-Herald, Georgia Guard Given Modern Battle Tanks, 29 July 1982Milwaukee Journal, Aspin Proposes Changes to Strengthen Reserves, 1 March 1984United Press International, The Bryan Times, National Guard Has Outmoded Equipment, 23 March 1985Norman Black, Associated Press, Lakeland Ledger, Regular Army Still Not Quite Ready to Accept New Guard as its Equal, 16 October 1988 In the late 1980s several state governors unsuccessfully challenged the authority of the President to federalize the National Guard in their states without their consent.  Governor Rudy Perpich and others objected to the National Guard being deployed to Central America during the political debate over whether the United States should be involved in the attempted overthrow of the Sandanista government of Nicaragua.Paul Glickman, Christian Science Monitor, President's New Control Over National Guard is Challenged, 9 February 1987David Evans, Chicago Tribune, Supreme Court Confirms U.S. Control Over Guard, 12 June 1990 In the first major test of the Total Force Policy, several Army National Guard units were activated for the 1991 Gulf War, mostly combat support and combat service support organizations.  Though there was controversy over the Army's decision not to deploy the "roundout brigades" of three divisions (the 48th Infantry Brigade, 155th Armored Brigade, and 256th Infantry Brigade) once they completed their mobilization training,Associated Press, Reading Eagle, Mobilizing Delays Assailed, 8 March 1991 other Army National Guard units were activated, served in Southwest Asia, and performed well.  Approximately 60,000 Army Guard soldiers were activated for the Gulf War, including the 142nd Field Artillery Brigade and 196th Field Artillery Brigade.Frank Jordan, On Guard magazine, Army Guard Does Well in Total Force Test, page 6, December, 1991 The National Guard also continued to carry out its role to aid in civil disturbance control, including responding to the 1992 Los Angeles riots.Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Violence in L.A.

Since its creation, the MCTFT has trainined more than one million registered students through live and distance learning courses. The National Guard also maintained its role as a state force available to respond to natural disasters, as with 1992's Hurricane Andrew.James Barron, New York Times, Hurricane Andrew; Thousands Homeless in Florida Storm, 26 August 1992 In the late 1990s, the Army National Guard was increasingly relied upon for overseas missions, including deployments in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Kosovo for stabilization and peacekeeping missions following the Bosnian War and Kosovo War.Washington Post, Celebration Awaits National Guard Unit's Return From Bosnia, 23 April 1998Kansas City Star, Kosovo Conflict Calls on Reserves: Kansans Among First Activated, 28 April 1999Bowling Green Daily News, Join the Army National Guard and Change the World, 27 June 1999 The role of the National Guard expanded following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

In 2015 the Army National Guard conducted a variety of activities, including the deployment of soldiers to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp for security operations, and soldiers serving in Afghanistan as part of Operation Resolute Support. In April and May 2015 members of the Army National Guard were called to respond to demonstrations in Baltimore, Maryland which took place to protest the Death of Freddie Gray. Members of the Army National Guard in Texas and nearby states responded in late May and early June to spring floods caused by higher than normal rainfall.  Also in 2015, Army National Guard members responded to wildfires in several states, including North Dakota, Minnesota, and Alaska,  Of the 44 individuals to serve as President of the United States as of 2015, 33 had military experience. Of those 33, 21 served in the militia or Army National Guard. (Note: President George W. Bush served in the National Guard in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and he was the first Air National Guard member to attain the presidency.)Clarke Rountree, George W. Bush: A Biography, 2010, pages xviii–xix     Upon the creation of the United States Air Force in 1948, which included the Air National Guard, the National Guard Bureau was organized into two divisions, Army and Air, each headed by a Major General who reported to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau.  Each Director's position was later upgraded to a Lieutenant General's assignment.  The Army National Guard is also authorized a Deputy Director.  Originally a Brigadier General, the post was later upgraded to Major General.  Individuals who served as Director or Deputy Director and subsequently served as NGB Chief include: Fleming; McGowan; Greenlief; Weber; Temple; Rees (acting); and Grass. The Director of the Army National Guard oversees a staff which aids in planning and day-to-day organization and management.  In addition to a chief of staff, the Director's staff includes several special staff members, including a chaplain and protocol and awards specialists.  It also includes a primary staff, which is organized as directorates, divisions, and branches.
