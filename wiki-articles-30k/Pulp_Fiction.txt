    Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American black comedy crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, from a story by Tarantino and Roger Avary.See, e.g., King (2002), pp. 185–7; ;  Tarantino's second feature film, it is iconic for its eclectic dialogue, ironic mix of humor and violence, nonlinear storyline, and a host of cinematic allusions and pop culture references. The film was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture; Tarantino and Avary won for Best Original Screenplay. It was also awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. A major critical and commercial success, it revitalized the career of its leading man, John Travolta, who received an Academy Award nomination, as did co-stars Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman. Directed in a highly stylized manner, Pulp Fiction connects the intersecting storylines of Los Angeles mobsters, fringe players, small-time criminals, and a mysterious briefcase. Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations that reveal the characters' senses of humor and perspectives on life. The film's title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue. Pulp Fiction is self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of "pulp". The plot, as in many of Tarantino's other works, is presented out of chronological sequence. The picture's self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive use of homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a prime example of postmodern film. The film has also been labeled as a black comedy and a "neo-noir".See, e.g., Waxman (2005), p. 64; Silver and Ursini (2004), p. 65; Real (1996), p. 122. Pulp Fiction is viewed as the inspiration for many later movies that adopted various elements of its style. The nature of its development, marketing, and distribution – and its consequent profitability – had a sweeping effect on the field of independent cinema. It is often considered a cultural watershed, with a strong influence felt in several other media. A 2008 Entertainment Weekly poll named Pulp Fiction the finest film to have been released since 1983, and it is considered by many critics to be one of the best-written films of all time. In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Pulp Fiction's narrative is told out of chronological order, and follows three main interrelated stories: mob [[contract killer]] Vincent Vega is the lead of the first story, prizefighter Butch Coolidge is the lead of the second, and Vincent's partner Jules Winnfield is the lead of the third.<ref name="PF93">"Pulp Fiction: The Facts" (1993 location interview), ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref> The stories intersect in various ways.  The film begins with a diner hold-up staged by a couple, then picks up the stories of Vincent, Jules, and Butch. It finally returns to where it began, in the diner. There are a total of seven narrative sequences; the three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles: # "Prologue—The Diner" (i) # Prelude to "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife" # "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife" # Prelude to "The Gold Watch" (a—flashback, b—present) # "The Gold Watch" # "The Bonnie Situation" # "Epilogue—The Diner" (ii) If the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. In Philip Parker's description, the structural form is "an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative."<ref>Parker (2002), p. 23.</ref> Other analysts describe the structure as a "circular narrative."<ref>See, e.g., Dancyger (2002), p. 235; {{cite web |author= Villella, Fiona A.| title = Circular Narratives: Highlights of Popular Cinema in the '90s | url =http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/3/circular.html#b2 | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20061231115331/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/3/circular.html#b2 | archivedate =2006-12-31|work=Senses of Cinema |date=January 2000| accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>  == Plot == ==="Prologue—The Diner"=== A couple, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, decide to rob the diner where they are drinking.  ===Prelude to "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife"=== Hitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega are on their way to retrieve a briefcase from Brett, who has transgressed against their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace. Vincent says Marsellus has asked him to escort his wife while Marsellus is out of town. They arrive at Brett's place, where they confront him and two of his associates over the briefcase. Vincent finds the briefcase and Jules shoots one of Brett's associates, then delivers a passage from the [[Bible]] before executing Brett with Vincent.  === "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife" === [[File:PulpFictionTwist.jpg|right|thumb|The "famous dance scene":<ref>Waxman (2005), p. 71. See also Barker and Austin (2000): "iconic scene" (p. 78).</ref> Vincent Vega ([[John Travolta]]) and Mia Wallace ([[Uma Thurman]]) do the twist at Jack Rabbit Slim's.]] Aging champion boxer Butch Coolidge accepts a large sum of money from Marsellus after agreeing to [[match fixing|take a dive]] in his upcoming match. Vincent and Jules arrive to deliver the briefcase. The next day, Vincent purchases [[heroin]] from his drug dealer Lance. He shoots up before driving to meet Mrs. Mia Wallace.  They head to a 1950s-[[Theme restaurant|themed restaurant]] and participate in a [[Twist (dance)|twist]] contest, then return to the Wallace house with the trophy. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for [[cocaine]], snorts it and [[drug overdose|overdoses]]. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house for help. They administer an [[adrenaline]] shot to Mia's heart, reviving her.  ===Prelude to "The Gold Watch"=== Butch recalls a visit from [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran Captain Koons in his youth. Koons brought a gold watch passed down through three generations of Coolidge men since World War I; at the dying request of Coolidge's father, Koons hid the watch in his rectum for two years to deliver it to Butch.  === "The Gold Watch" === Butch flees the arena, having [[Double cross (betrayal)#Double cross|double-crossed]] Marsellus and won the bout. The next morning, at the motel where he and his girlfriend Fabienne are lying low, Butch discovers she has forgotten to pack his father's watch and flies into a rage. He returns to his apartment, retrieves the watch, and notices a gun on the kitchen counter. Hearing the toilet flush, Butch shoots Vincent dead after he exits the bathroom.  As Butch waits at a traffic light in his car, Marsellus walks by and recognizes him. Marsellus chases him into a pawnshop. The owner, Maynard, captures them at gunpoint and ties them up in a basement. Maynard is joined by Zed, a security guard; they take Marsellus to another room to rape him, leaving a silent figure in a [[bondage suit]], "the gimp", to watch Butch.  Butch breaks loose and knocks out the gimp. He is about to flee, but decides to save Marsellus. As Zed is raping Marsellus, Butch kills Maynard with a [[katana]]. Marsellus retrieves Maynard's shotgun and shoots Zed, promising to torture Zed to death as he survives the gunshot. Marsellus informs Butch that they are even, so long as he never tells anyone about the rape and departs Los Angeles forever. Butch returns to pick up Fabienne on Zed's [[chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]].  === "The Bonnie Situation"=== After Vincent and Jules execute Brett, another man bursts out of the bathroom and shoots wildly, missing every time; Jules and Vincent shoot him. Jules decides their lucky escape was a miracle, which Vincent disputes.  As they drive, Vincent accidentally shoots one of Brett's associates in the face. They hide the car at the home of their associate Jimmie, who insists they deal with the problem before his wife Bonnie comes home. Marsellus sends his [[Cleaner (crime)|cleaner]], Winston Wolfe, who orders Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, and dispose of their bloody clothes. They drive the car to a junk yard and Jules and Vincent decide to get breakfast.  ==="Epilogue—The Diner"=== In the diner, Jules tells Vincent he plans to retire from his life of crime, on account of their apparently miraculous survival from the previous story. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny hold up the restaurant. Jules holds Pumpkin at gunpoint. Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and trains her gun on Jules; Vincent returns with his gun trained on her. Jules recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take the cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase.  == Cast == * [[John Travolta]] as Vincent Vega: :Tarantino cast Travolta in ''Pulp Fiction'' because [[Michael Madsen]], who had played Vic Vega in ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', chose to appear in [[Kevin Costner]]'s ''[[Wyatt Earp (film)|Wyatt Earp]]'' instead.

[[Dick Dale]]'s rendition of "[[Misirlou]]" plays during the opening credits. Tarantino chose surf music as the basic musical style for the film, but not, he insists, because of its association with surfing culture: "To me it just sounds like rock and roll, even [[Ennio Morricone|Morricone]] music. It sounds like rock and roll [[spaghetti Western]] music."<ref>Dawson (1995), p. 162.</ref> Some of the songs were suggested to Tarantino by his friends Chuck Kelley and Laura Lovelace, who were credited as music consultants.

[The] use of the mono-tracked, beat-heavy style of early 1960s U.S. 'underground' pop mixed with 'classic' ballads such as [[Dusty Springfield]]'s '[[Son of a Preacher Man]]' is crucial to the film's postmodern knowingness." She contrasts the soundtrack with that of ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', the highest-grossing film of 1994, which also relies on period pop recordings: "[T]he version of 'the sixties' offered by ''Pulp Fiction''...is certainly not that of the publicly recognized counter-culture featured in ''Forrest Gump'', but is, rather, a more genuinely marginal form of sub-culture based around a lifestyle—surfing, 'hanging'—that is resolutely apolitical." The soundtrack is central, she says, to the film's engagement with the "younger, cinematically knowledgeable spectator" it solicits.<ref>Tincknell (2006), p. 139.</ref>  == Reception == === Release and box office === ''Pulp Fiction'' premiered in May 1994 at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]].

''[[The New York Times]]'' published its review the day of the opening. [[Janet Maslin]] called the film a "triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color.... [He] has come up with a work of such depth, wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of American film makers."<ref name="Mas" />  On October 14, 1994, ''Pulp Fiction'' went into general release in the United States. As Peter Biskind describes, "It was not platformed, that is, it did not open in a handful of theaters and roll out slowly as word of mouth built, the traditional way of releasing an [[indie film]]; it went wide immediately, into 1,100 theaters."<ref name="B189">Biskind (2004), p. 189.</ref> In the eyes of some cultural critics, ''Reservoir Dogs'' had given Tarantino a reputation for glamorizing violence. Miramax played with the issue in its marketing campaign: "You won't know the facts till you've seen the fiction", went one slogan.<ref>Dawson (1995), p. 171.</ref> ''Pulp Fiction'' was the top-grossing film at the box office its first weekend, edging out a [[Sylvester Stallone]] vehicle, ''[[The Specialist]]'', which was in its second week and playing at more than twice as many theaters. Against its budget of $8.5 million and about $10 million in marketing costs, ''Pulp Fiction'' wound up grossing $107.93 million at the U.S. box office, making it the first "indie" film to surpass $100 million.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' described it as "so well-written in a scruffy, [[fanzine]] way that you want to rub noses in it—the noses of those zombie writers who take 'screenwriting' classes that teach them the formulas for 'hit films.'"<ref>{{cite news|author=Ebert, Roger|title=''Pulp Fiction''|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19941014/REVIEWS/410140304/1023|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=1994-10-14|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' wrote, "It towers over the year's other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool.

[[Kenneth Turan]] wrote, "The writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities."<ref>Turan, Kenneth. "Quentin Tarantino's Gangster Rap", ''Los Angeles Times'', October 14, 1994.</ref> Some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than to ''Pulp Fiction'' itself. While not panning the film, [[Stanley Kauffman]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'' felt that "the way that [it] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. ''Pulp Fiction'' nourishes, abets, cultural slumming."<ref>Kauffman, Stanley. "Shooting Up", ''New Republic'', November 14, 1994.</ref> Responding to comparisons between Tarantino's film and the work of [[French New Wave]] director [[Jean-Luc Godard]], especially his first, most famous feature, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' wrote, "The fact that ''Pulp Fiction'' is garnering more extravagant raves than ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful—namely, the ones we already have and don't wish to expand."<ref name="JR">Rosenbaum, Jonathan.

Violence was often the theme. In the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Donna Britt described how she was happy not to see ''Pulp Fiction'' on a recent weekend and thus avoid "discussing the rousing scene in which a gunshot sprays somebody's brains around a car interior".<ref>Britt, Donna. "Let's Lose the Gory 'Gulp' Fiction", ''Washington Post'', October 25, 1994.</ref> Some commentators took exception to the film's frequent use of the word "[[nigger]]". In the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Todd Boyd argued that the word's recurrence "has the ability to signify the ultimate level of hipness for white males who have historically used their perception of black masculinity as the embodiment of cool".<ref>Boyd, Todd. "Tarantino's Mantra?" ''Chicago Tribune'', November 6, 1994. See also Willis (1997), pp. 211, 213, 256 n. 39.</ref> In Britain, [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', set the tone for much subsequent criticism: "Tarantino represents the final triumph of [[postmodernism]], which is to empty the artwork of all content, thus avoiding its capacity to do anything except helplessly represent our agonies....

In 1995, in a special edition of ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Siskel & Ebert]]'' devoted to Tarantino, [[Gene Siskel]] argued that ''Pulp Fiction'' posed a major challenge to the "ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas". In Siskel's view,  <blockquote> the violent intensity of ''Pulp Fiction'' calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' [1960], [[Arthur Penn]]'s ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' [1967], and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' [1971]. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for ''Pulp Fiction''. Like all great films, it criticizes other movies.<ref name="SE">"Pulp Faction: The Tarantino Generation", ''Siskel & Ebert'', ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref> </blockquote>  Ken Dancyger writes that its "imitative and innovative style"—like that of its predecessor, ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''—represents  <blockquote> a new phenomenon, the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life. The consequence is twofold—the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as the [[gangster film]]s or Westerns, horror films or adventure films. And that the parody or alteration of that film creates a new form, a different experience for the audience.<ref>Dancyger (2002), p. 228.</ref> </blockquote> [[File:Quentin Tarantino Uma Thurman John Travolta Cannes 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Travolta]], [[Uma Thurman]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]] at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]], for the film's 20th anniversary tribute.]] In a widely covered speech on May 31, 1995, Republican presidential candidate [[Bob Dole]] attacked the American entertainment industry for peddling "nightmares of depravity".

"[I]t kind of went somewhere else".<ref>Quoted in O'Brien (1994), p. 90.</ref> Geoffrey O'Brien sees the result as connected "rather powerfully to a parallel pulp tradition: the tales of terror and the uncanny practiced by such writers as [[Cornell Woolrich]] [and] [[Fredric Brown]].... Both dealt heavily in the realm of improbable coincidences and cruel cosmic jokes, a realm that ''Pulp Fiction'' makes its own."<ref>O'Brien (1994), pp. 90, 91.</ref> In particular, O'Brien finds a strong affinity between the intricate plot mechanics and twists of Brown's novels and the recursive, interweaving structure of ''Pulp Fiction''.<ref>O'Brien (1994), p. 91.</ref> Philip French describes the film's narrative as a "circular movement or [[Möbius strip]] of a kind [[Alain Resnais|Resnais]] and [[Alain Robbe-Grillet|Robbe-Grillet]] would admire."<ref>{{cite news|author=French, Philip|title=''Pulp Fiction''|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2006/mar/26/1|work=The Observer|date=2006-03-26|accessdate=2008-12-28 | location=London}}</ref> James Mottram regards crime novelist [[Elmore Leonard]], whose influence Tarantino has acknowledged, as the film's primary literary antecedent. He suggests that Leonard's "rich dialogue" is reflected in Tarantino's "popular-culture-strewn jive"; he also points to the acute, extremely dark sense of humor Leonard applies to the realm of violence as a source of inspiration.<ref>Mottram (2006), p. 228. See also p. 77.</ref>  Robert Kolker sees the "flourishes, the apparent witty banality of the dialogue, the goofy fracturing of temporality [as] a patina over a [[pastiche]]. The pastiche...is essentially of two films that Tarantino can't seem to get out of his mind: ''[[Mean Streets]]'' [1973; directed by [[Martin Scorsese]], who loved Pulp Fiction and the way the film was told.<ref name = "Scorsese">{{cite episode| title = Martin Scorsese's Best Films of the '90s| series = Roger Ebert & the Movies| serieslink = At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper| credits = [[Martin Scorsese]] (guest host), [[Roger Ebert]] (host)| airdate = 2000-02-26| season = 1| number = 26}}</ref> ] and ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'' [1956; directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]]]."<ref>Kolker (2000), p. 249.</ref> He contrasts ''Pulp Fiction'' with postmodern Hollywood predecessors ''[[Hudson Hawk]]'' (1991; starring Willis) and ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' (1993; starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) that "took the joke too far...simply mocked or suggested that they were smarter than the audience" and flopped.<ref name="K281">Kolker (2000), p. 281.</ref> Todd McCarthy writes that the film's "striking widescreen compositions often contain objects in extreme close-up as well as vivid contrasts, sometimes bringing to mind the visual strategies of [[Sergio Leone]]", an acknowledged hero of Tarantino's.<ref name="TM" /> To Martin Rubin, the "expansive, brightly colored widescreen visuals" evoke comedy directors such as [[Frank Tashlin]] and [[Blake Edwards]].<ref>Rubin (1999), p. 174.</ref>  The movie's host of [[popular culture|pop culture]] allusions, ranging from the famous image of [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s skirt flying up over a subway grating to Jules addressing a soon-to-be victim as "[[Flock of Seagulls]]" because of his haircut,<ref>Tarantino (1994), pp. 24, 27; Conard (2006), p. 108.</ref> have led many critics to discuss it within the framework of [[postmodernism]]. Describing the film in 2005 as Tarantino's "postmodern masterpiece...to date", David Walker writes that it "is marked by its playful reverence for the 1950s...and its constantly teasing and often deferential references to other films". He characterizes its convoluted narrative technique as "postmodern tricksiness".<ref>Walker (2005), p. 315.</ref> Calling the film a "terminally hip postmodern collage", Foster Hirsch finds ''Pulp Fiction'' far from a masterpiece: "authoritative, influential, and meaningless". Set "in a world that could exist only in the movies", it is "a succulent guilty pleasure, beautifully made junk food for [[cinephile|cinéastes]]".<ref>Hirsch (1997), pp. 360, 340.</ref> O'Brien, dismissing attempts to associate the movie with [[film noir]], argues that "''Pulp Fiction'' is more a guided tour of an infernal theme park decorated with cultural detritus, [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Mamie Van Doren]], fragments of [[blaxploitation]] and [[Roger Corman]] and ''[[Shogun Assassin]]'', music out of a twenty-four-hour oldies station for which all the decades since the fifties exist simultaneously."<ref name=OB90/> Catherine Constable takes the moment in which a needle filled with adrenaline is plunged into the comatose Mia's heart as exemplary. She proposes that it "can be seen as effecting her resurrection from the dead, simultaneously recalling and undermining the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] convention of the vampire's stake. On this model, the referencing of previous aesthetic forms and styles moves beyond...empty pastiche, sustaining an 'inventive and affirmative' mode of postmodernism."<ref>Constable (2004), p. 54.</ref>  Mark T. Conard asks, "[W]hat is the film ''about''?" and answers, "American [[nihilism]]."<ref>Conard (2006), p. 125.</ref> Hirsch suggests, "If the film is actually about anything other than its own cleverness, it seems dedicated to the dubious thesis that hit men are part of the human family."<ref name="H360" /> Richard Alleva argues that "''Pulp Fiction'' has about as much to do with actual criminality or violence as ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' with the realities of seventeenth-century France or ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' with Balkan politics." He reads the movie as a form of romance whose allure is centered in the characters' nonnaturalistic discourse, "wise-guy literate, media-smart, obscenely [[epigram]]matic".<ref>{{cite news|author=Alleva, Richard|title=''Pulp Fiction''|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_n20_v121/ai_15879432/pg_1|work=Commonweal|date=1994-11-18|accessdate=2007-10-08}}</ref> In Alan Stone's view, the "absurd dialogue", like that between Vincent and Jules in the scene where the former accidentally kills Marvin, "unexpectedly transforms the meaning of the violence cliché.... ''Pulp Fiction'' unmasks the macho myth by making it laughable and deheroicizes the power trip glorified by standard Hollywood violence."<ref name="Stone">{{cite web|author=Stone, Alan|title=''Pulp Fiction''|url=http://bostonreview.net/BR20.2/stone.html|work=Boston Review|date=April–May 1995|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> Stone reads the film as "[[politically correct]]. There is no nudity and no violence directed against women.... [It] celebrates interracial friendship and cultural diversity; there are strong women and strong black men, and the director swims against the current of class stereotype."<ref name="Stone" />  Where Stone sees a celebration, Kolker finds a vacuum: "The postmodern insouciance, violence, homophobia, and racism of ''Pulp Fiction'' were perfectly acceptable because the film didn't pretend seriousness and therefore didn't mock it."<ref name="K281" /> Calling it the "acme of postmodern nineties filmmaking", he explains, "the postmodern is about surfaces; it is flattened spatiality in which event and character are in a steady state of reminding us that they are pop-cultural figures."<ref>Kolker (2000), pp. 249, 250.</ref> According to Kolker:  <blockquote> That's why ''Pulp Fiction'' was so popular. Not because all audiences got all or any of its references to Scorsese and Kubrick, but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification. The film's cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world, but this nastiness keeps being laughed off—by the mock intensity of the action, the prowling, confronting, perverse, confined, and airless nastiness of the world Tarantino creates.<ref name="K250">Kolker (2000), p. 250.</ref> </blockquote>  [[Henry Giroux|Henry A. Giroux]] argues that Tarantino "empties violence of any critical social consequences, offering viewers only the immediacy of shock, humor, and irony-without-insight as elements of mediation. None of these elements gets beyond the seduction of voyeuristic gazing...[t]he facile consumption of shocking images and hallucinatory delight."<ref>Giroux (1996), p. 77.</ref>  Regarding the violence and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that ''Pulp Fiction'' should be seen in light of the short stories of [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref>[Pamela H. Demory, "Violence and Transcendence in ''Pulp Fiction'' and Flannery O'Connor" in ''The Image of Violence in Literature, the Media, and Society: Selected Papers [from the] 1995 Conference [of the] Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Social Imagery'', ed. and intro., Will Wright and Steven Kaplan (Pueblo, Co.: Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Social Imagery, 1995): 187-194.]</ref> which likewise feature "religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor". Discussing "the connection between violence and redemption", Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers "of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace," Tarantino "seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything we have seen in the film--all the violence, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior--grace is still possible; there might be still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits."<ref>[Quoted in ''Flannery O'Connor: An Annotated Reference Guide to Criticism'', ed. R. Neil Scott (Milledgeville, Georgia: Timberlane Books, 2002), p. 185]</ref>  === Homage as essence ===  ==== Cinema ==== ''Pulp Fiction'' is full of [[Homage (arts)|homage]]s to other movies. "Tarantino's characters", writes Gary Groth, "inhabit a world where the entire landscape is composed of Hollywood product. Tarantino is a cinematic kleptomaniac—he literally can't help himself."<ref>Groth (1997), p. 189.</ref> Two scenes in particular have prompted discussion of the film's highly [[intertextual]] style. Many have assumed that the dance sequence at Jack Rabbit Slim's was intended as a reference to Travolta's star-making performance as Tony Manero in the epochal ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977); Tarantino, however, credits a scene in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Bande à part (film)|Bande à part]]'' (1964) with the inspiration. According to the filmmaker,  <blockquote> Everybody thinks that I wrote this scene just to have John Travolta dancing. But the scene existed before John Travolta was cast. But once he was cast, it was like, "Great. We get to see John dance. All the better."...&nbsp;My favorite musical sequences have always been in Godard, because they just come out of nowhere. It's so infectious, so friendly. And the fact that it's not a musical, but he's stopping the movie to have a musical sequence, makes it all the more sweet.<ref name="T9">Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 9, ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref> </blockquote>  [[Jerome Charyn]] argues that, beyond "all the better", Travolta's presence is essential to the power of the scene, and of the film:  <blockquote> Travolta's entire career becomes "[[Back-story|backstory]]", the myth of a movie star who has fallen out of favor, but still resides in our memory as the king of disco. We keep waiting for him to shed his paunch, put on a white polyester suit, and enter the 2001 Odyssey club in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he will dance for us and never, never stop.

The 'past' thus becomes a more general 'pastness' in which the stylistic signifiers of various decades are loaded in to a single moment."<ref name="T">Tincknell (2006), p. 140.</ref> She also argues that in this passage the film "briefly shifts from its habitually ironic discourse to one that references the conventions of the classic [[Musical film|film musical]] and in doing so makes it possible for the film to inhabit an affective space that goes beyond stylistic allusion."<ref name="T" />  The pivotal moment in which Marsellus crosses the street in front of Butch's car and notices him evokes the scene in which Marion Crane's boss sees her under similar circumstances in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960).<ref>Dawson (1995), p. 178; Polan (2000), p. 19.</ref> Marsellus and Butch are soon held captive by Maynard and Zed, "two sadistic honkies straight out of ''[[Deliverance]]''" (1972), directed by [[John Boorman]].<ref name="Stone" /> Zed shares a name with [[Sean Connery]]'s character in Boorman's follow-up, the science-fiction film ''[[Zardoz]]'' (1974).

For Tarantino's admiration of Siegel, see Dawson (1995), p. 142.</ref>  David Bell argues that far from going against the "current of class stereotype", this scene, like ''Deliverance'', "mobilize[s] a certain construction of poor white country folk—and particularly their sexualization...'rustic sexual expression often takes the form of homosexual rape' in American movies."<ref>Bell (2000), p. 87.</ref> Stephen Paul Miller believes the ''Pulp Fiction'' scene goes down much easier than the one it echoes: "The buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was in ''Deliverance''.... The nineties film reduces seventies competition, horror, and taboo into an entertainingly subtle adrenaline play—a fiction, a pulp fiction."<ref>Miller (1999), p. 76.</ref> Giroux reads the rape scene homage similarly: "in the end Tarantino's use of parody is about repetition, transgression, and softening the face of violence by reducing it to the property of film history."<ref>Giroux (1996), p. 78.</ref> In Groth's view, the crucial difference is that "in ''Deliverance'' the rape created the film's central moral dilemma whereas in ''Pulp Fiction'' it was merely 'the single weirdest day of [Butch's] life.'"<ref>Groth (1997), p. 188.</ref>  Neil Fulwood focuses on Butch's weapon selection, writing, "Here, Tarantino's love of movies is at its most open and nonjudgemental, tipping a nod to the noble and the notorious, as well as sending up his own reputation as an [[enfant terrible]] of movie violence. Moreover, the scene makes a sly comment about the readiness of cinema to seize upon whatever is to hand for its moments of mayhem and murder."<ref name="F" /> White asserts that "the katana he finally, and significantly, selects identifies him with...[[honour]]able heroes."<ref name="W" /> Conard argues that the first three items symbolize a nihilism that Butch is rejecting. The traditional Japanese sword, in contrasts, represents a culture with a well-defined [[moral code]] and thus connects Butch with a more meaningful approach to life.<ref>Conard (2006), pp. 125, 133.</ref>  ==== Television ==== Robert Miklitsch argues that "Tarantino's telephilia" may be more central to the guiding sensibility of ''Pulp Fiction'' than the filmmaker's love for rock 'n' roll and even cinema:  <blockquote> Talking about his generation, one that came of age in the '70s, Tarantino has commented that the "number one thing we all shared wasn't music, that was a Sixties thing. Our culture was television." A random list of the TV programs referenced in ''Pulp Fiction'' confirms his observation: ''[[Speed Racer]], [[Clutch Cargo]], [[The Brady Bunch]], [[The Partridge Family]], [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]], [[The Three Stooges]], [[The Flintstones]], [[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]], [[Green Acres]], [[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]], [[Happy Days]]'', and last but not least, Mia's fictional pilot, ''Fox Force Five''.<ref>Miklitsch, pp. 15, 16. Note that while the Three Stooges did have an original TV series that ran briefly in the mid-1960s, they were most familiar from their cinematic [[Short subject|shorts]] that were [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to television.</ref> </blockquote>  "The above list, with the possible exception of ''The Avengers''," writes Miklitsch, "suggests that ''Pulp Fiction'' has less of an elective affinity with the cinematic avant-gardism of Godard than with mainstream network programming."<ref name="M16">Miklitsch, p. 16.</ref> Jonathan Rosenbaum had brought TV into his analysis of the Tarantino/Godard comparison, acknowledging that the directors were similar in wanting to cram everything they like onscreen: "But the differences between what Godard likes and what Tarantino likes and why are astronomical; it's like comparing a combined museum, library, film archive, record shop, and department store with a jukebox, a video-rental outlet, and an issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''."<ref name="JR" />  Sharon Willis focuses on the way a television show (''[[Clutch Cargo]]'') marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father's comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movie ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978). Willis writes that "when Captain Koons enters the living room, we see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruined [[masculinity]] in search of rehabilitation.... [T]he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze."<ref name="Willis">Willis (1997), p. 195.</ref> Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a "prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their bête noire: TV."<ref name="M16" /> Kolker might not disagree, arguing that "''Pulp Fiction'' is a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move through a series of long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend."<ref name="K250" />  === Notable motifs ===  ==== The mysterious 666 briefcase ==== {{multiple image | align     = right | direction = vertical | width     = 200  | image1    = PulpFictionCase.jpg | caption1  =Vincent "stares...transfixed" into the glowing case, as specified in Tarantino's screenplay.<ref>Tarantino (1994), p. 28.</ref>  | image2    = KissMeDeadlyPandora.jpg | caption2  = Vincent's demeanor reinforces the allusion to the scene in ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955) in which Lily Carver, aka Gabrielle ([[Gaby Rodgers]]), gazes into the glowing case.<ref>Gallefant (2006), p. 46.</ref>}}  The combination of the mysterious suitcase lock is 666, the "[[number of the beast]]". Tarantino has said  there is no explanation for its contents—it is simply a [[MacGuffin]], a pure [[plot device]]. Originally, the case was to contain diamonds, but this was seen as too mundane. For filming purposes, it contained a hidden orange light bulb that produced an otherworldly glow.<ref>{{cite web|title=What's In the Briefcase?|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/pulp.htm|publisher=Snopes.com|date=2007-08-17|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> In a 2007 video interview with fellow director and friend [[Robert Rodriguez]], Tarantino purportedly "reveals" the secret contents of the briefcase, but the film cuts out and skips the scene in the style employed in Tarantino and Rodriguez's ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007), with an intertitle that reads "Missing Reel". The interview resumes with Rodriguez discussing how radically the "knowledge" of the briefcase's contents alters one's understanding of the movie.<ref name="Myspace">{{cite web|title=Rodriguez and Tarantino: Artist On Artist|url=http://creative.myspace.com/groups/_mh/aoa/pages/qtarantino_rrodriguez/qtarantino_rrodriguez.html|publisher=MySpace.com|date=April 6, 2007|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref>  Despite Tarantino's statements, many solutions to what one scholar calls this "unexplained postmodern puzzle" have been proposed.<ref name="Real" /> A strong similarity has often been observed with the 1955 [[film noir]] ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]''. That movie, whose protagonist Tarantino has cited as a source for Butch, features a glowing briefcase housing an atomic explosive.<ref>See, e.g., Groth (1997), p. 188; Polan (2000), p. 20; {{cite web|title=What's in the Briefcase in ''Pulp Fiction''?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mpulpfiction.html|publisher=The Straight Dope|date=2000-05-31|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> In their review of Alex Cox's 1984 film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' in the ''Daily Telegraph'',  Nick Cowen and Hari Patience suggest that ''Pulp Fiction'' may also owe "a debt of inspiration" to the glowing car trunk in that film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/wheelsonfilm/2753942/Wheels-On-Film-Repo-Man.html|title=Wheels on Film: Repo Man|date= 16 Aug 2008|author=Nick Cowen, Hari Patience|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref> In scholar Paul Gormley's view, this connection with ''Kiss Me Deadly'', and a similar one with ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), makes it possible to read the eerie glow as symbolic of violence itself.<ref>Gormley (2005), p. 164.</ref> The idea that the briefcase contains Marsellus' soul gained popular currency in the mid-1990s. Analyzing the notion, [[Roger Ebert]] dismissed it as "nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the Net".<ref>Ebert 1997, p. 188.</ref>  ==== Jules' Bible passage ==== Jules ritually recites what he describes as a biblical passage, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 25:17, before he executes someone. The passage is heard three times—in the introductory sequence in which Jules and Vincent reclaim Marsellus' briefcase from the doomed Brett; that same recitation a second time, at the beginning of "The Bonnie Situation", which overlaps the end of the earlier sequence; and in the epilogue at the diner. The first version of the passage is as follows:  <blockquote>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.</blockquote>  The second version, from the diner scene, is identical except for the final line: "And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."  {{listen|filename=End of Ezekiel.ogg|title="And I will strike down..."| description= Conclusion of the "Ezekiel 25:17" monologue and Brett's murder}}  While the final two sentences of Jules' speech are similar to the actual cited passage, the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases.<ref>Reinhartz (2003), p. 108.</ref> The text of Ezekiel 25 preceding verse 17 indicates that God's wrath is retribution for the hostility of the [[Philistine]]s. In the [[Authorized King James Version|King James version]] from which Jules' speech is adapted, Ezekiel 25:17 reads in its entirety:  <blockquote>And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I ''am'' the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/108/26/25.html|title=The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel, 25|work=The Holy Bible: King James Version|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref></blockquote>  Tarantino's primary inspiration for the speech was the work of Japanese [[martial arts films|martial arts]] star [[Sonny Chiba]]. Its text and its identification as Ezekiel 25:17 derive from an almost identical creed that appears at the beginning of the Chiba movie ''[[Karate Kiba]]'' (''The Bodyguard''; 1976), where it is both shown as a scrolling text and read by an offscreen narrator.<ref>Thomas (2003) notes that instead of "the Lord", this version reads "...and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard..." (pp. 61–62). Conard (2006) claims that the text originates from the film ''Bodigaado Kiba'' (''Bodyguard Kiba'' or ''The Bodyguard''; 1973) and that the end phrase there is "And you will know my name is Chiba the Bodyguard..." (p. 135, n. 4).</ref>  The version seen at the beginning of ''The Bodyguard (1976)'' is as follows:  <blockquote>The path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the iniquity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the father of lost children. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger, who poison and destroy my brothers; and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard when I shall lay my vengeance upon them! [Ezekiel 25:17]</blockquote>  In the 1980s television series ''Kage no Gundan'' (''[[Shadow Warriors (TV series)|Shadow Warriors]]''), Chiba's character would lecture the villain-of-the-week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him.<ref>Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 4, ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref> A killer delivers a similar biblical rant in ''[[Modesty Blaise (novel)|Modesty Blaise]]'', the hardback but pulp-style novel Vincent is shown with in two scenes.<ref name="T25">Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 25, ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref>  Two critics who have analyzed the role of the speech find different ties between Jules' transformation and the issue of [[postmodernity]]. Gormley argues that unlike the film's other major characters—Marsellus aside—Jules is:  <blockquote> linked to a "thing" beyond postmodern simulation.... [T]his is perhaps most marked when he moves on from being a simulation of a Baptist preacher, spouting Ezekiel because it was "just a cool thing to say...." In his conversion, Jules is shown to be cognizant of a place beyond this simulation, which, in this case, the film constructs as God.<ref>Gormley (2005), p. 167.</ref> </blockquote>  [[Adele Reinhartz]] writes that the "depth of Jules's transformation" is indicated by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: "In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness.... In the second...he appears to be a different sort of man altogether.... [I]n true postmodern fashion, [he] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation."<ref>Reinhartz (2003), pp. 106, 107.</ref> Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him "that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life"; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture.<ref>Conard (2006), p. 130.</ref> Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: "[T]he [[spiritual awakening]] at the end of ''Pulp Fiction'', which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It may make you feel good, but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser."<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan. "Allusion Profusion (''Ed Wood, Pulp Fiction'')", ''Chicago Reader'', October 21, 1994. Note that the avowed inspiration is actually a TV show, ''Kung Fu''.</ref>  ==== The bathroom ==== Much of ''Pulp Fiction''{{'}}s action revolves around characters who are either in the bathroom or need to use the toilet. To a lesser extent, Tarantino's other films also feature this narrative element.<ref>{{cite web|author=White, Mike, and Mike Thompson|work= Cashiers du Cinemart|title=Tarantino in a Can?|url= http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_2/2_toilet.asp?IshNum=2&Headline=Tarantino%20In%20The%20Can|date=Spring 1995|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> At Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia goes to "powder her nose"—literally; she [[Cocaine#Insufflation|snorts coke]] in the restroom, surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping. Butch and Fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom, he in the shower, she brushing her teeth; the next morning, but just a few seconds later in screen time, she is again brushing her teeth. As Jules and Vincent confront Brett and two of his pals, a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom—his actions will lead to Jules' transformative "moment of clarity". After Marvin's absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie's bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel.<ref name="Den" /> When the diner hold-up turns into a [[Mexican standoff]], "Honey Bunny" whines, "I gotta go pee!"<ref name="F15">Fraiman (2003), p. 15.</ref>  As described by Peter and Will Brooker, "In three significant moments Vincent retires to the bathroom [and] returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened."<ref name="B&B">Brooker and Brooker (1996), p. 239.</ref> The threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically, and is realized in the third instance:  # Vincent and Jules’ diner breakfast and philosophical conversation is aborted by Vincent's bathroom break; an armed robbery ensues while Vincent is reading on the toilet. # While Vincent is in the bathroom worrying about the possibility of going too far with Marsellus' wife, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses. # During a stakeout at Butch’s apartment, Vincent emerges from the toilet with his book and is killed by Butch.  In the Brookers' analysis, "Through Vince...we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent, transformed, disastrously, in the instant you are not looking."<ref name="B&B" /> Fraiman finds it particularly significant that Vincent is reading ''Modesty Blaise'' in two of these instances. She links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as "the archetypal consumers of pulp":  <blockquote> Locating popular fiction in the bathroom, Tarantino reinforces its association with shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of "pulp" that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then is a series of damaging associations—pulp, women, shit—that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent's reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub.<ref>Fraiman (2003), p. 14. Fraiman's identification of the submachine gun as a [[Škorpion vz. 61|Czech M61]] matches the description in the screenplay: Tarantino (1994), p. 96. Visual evidence suggests that a different gun was actually used in the film, possibly a [[MAC-10]] or similar model.</ref> </blockquote>  Willis reads ''Pulp Fiction'' in almost precisely the opposite direction, finding "its overarching project as a drive to turn shit into gold. This is one way of describing the project of redeeming and recycling popular culture, especially the popular culture of one's childhood, as is Tarantino's wont as well as his stated aim."<ref name="Willis" /> Despite that, argues Fraiman, "''Pulp Fiction'' demonstrates...that even an open pulpophile like Tarantino may continue to feel anxious and emasculated by his preferences."<ref name="F15" />  == Awards == ''Pulp Fiction'' won eight awards from a total of twenty-six nominations.<ref name="PdO" /><ref name="Awards" /><ref name="BAFTA" /><ref name="GGA">{{cite web |url= http://www.hfpa.org/browse/film/24792|title= Awards Search/''Pulp Fiction''|publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref><ref name="NSFC">{{cite news|author=Maslin, Janet |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4D91030F937A35752C0A963958260|title= "Pulp Fiction" Gets Top Prize From National Film Critics|work=New York Times|date=1995-01-04|accessdate=2007-09-27}}</ref> Also, in the balloting by the National Society of Film Critics, Samuel L.
