 John Zorn (born September 2, 1953) is an American avant-garde composer, arranger, producer, saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist with hundreds of album credits as performer, composer, and producer across a variety of genres including jazz, rock, hardcore, classical, surf, metal, klezmer, soundtrack, ambient and improvised music. He incorporates diverse styles in his compositions which he identifies as avant-garde or experimental.Milkowski, B., "John Zorn: One Future, Two Views" (interview) in Jazz Times, March 2000, pp.&nbsp;28–35,118-121, accessed 24 July 2010 Zorn was described by Down Beat as "one of our most important composers".Alkyer, F. First Take: Happy Bithday Mr Zorn, Down Beat, October, 2013, p. 10. Zorn established himself within the New York City downtown music movement in the mid-1970s performing with musicians across the sonic spectrum and developing experimental methods of composing new music. After releasing albums on several independent US and European labels, Zorn signed with Elektra Nonesuch and received wide acclaim with the release of The Big Gundown, an album reworking the compositions of Ennio Morricone.Rockwell, J., Zorn Variations on Themes by Morricone, NY Times, November 2, 1986 He attracted further attention worldwide with the release of Spillane in 1987, and Naked City in 1989.Watrous, P., 'Spillane,' a Blend of American Styles, NY Times, May 25, 1988Rockwell, J., As Important As Anyone In His Generation", NY Times, February 21, 1988Pareles, J., There Are 8 Million Stories in John Zorn's Naked City, NY Times, April 8, 1990 After spending almost a decade travelling between Japan and the US he made New York his permanent base and established his own record label, Tzadik, in the mid-1990s.Watrous, P., John Zorn Takes Over the Town NY Times, February 24, 1989Fordham, J.

Zorn has undertaken many tours of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, often performing at festivals with many other musicians and ensembles that perform his diverse output.John Zorn Festival in Israel 2008 website accessed 2 September 2008.Kelman, J. Festival International Musique Actuelle Victoriaville Review at All About Jazz, 15 May 2008.Moore, C. Adelaide Festival 2014: Loud and Proud, Limelight, October 29, 2014 Zorn's compositions cross many genres and he has stated  "All the various styles are organically connected to one another. I'm an additive person—the entire storehouse of my knowledge informs everything I do. People are so obsessed with the surface that they can't see the connections, but they are there."Service, T. "Shuffle and Cut", The Guardian, March 7, 2003. For Zorn "Composing is more than just imagining music—it's knowing how to communicate it to musicians. And you don't give an improviser music that's completely written out, or ask a classical musician to improvise. I'm interested in speaking to musicians in their own languages, on their own terms, and in bringing out the best in what they do. To challenge them and excite them."Schmelzer, P., "Visionary, Mensch, Dude: 60 on John Zorn at 60", Walker Magazine, April 3, 2013 John Zorn was born in New York City and learned piano, guitar and flute as a child.Helland, D Downbeat.com John Zorn Biography His family had diverse musical tastes: his mother listened to classical and world music, his father was interested in jazz, French chansons, and country music, and his older brother collected doo-wop, and 1950s rock and roll records.Bourgin, S.

Zorn acquired an interest in experimental and avant-garde music after buying a record by Mauricio Kagel in 1968 at the age of fifteen.Put More Blood Into the Music (1989) He taught himself orchestration and counterpoint by transcribing scores and studied composition under Leonardo Balada.Wendell, E.

(1998) John Zorn interview in Rockers, Jazzbos & Visionaries New York: Watson-Guptill PublicationsBartlett A Zorn of Plenty Seattle Weekly, June 23, 1999 While still at Webster, Zorn incorporated elements of free jazz, avant-garde and experimental music, film scores, performance art and the cartoon scores of Carl Stalling into his first recordings which were later released as First Recordings 1973 (1995).Zorn, J (1995) liner notes to John Zorn: First Recordings 1973. New York: Tzadik Zorn dropped out of college and, following a stint on the West Coast, moved to Manhattan. There he gave concerts in his apartment and other small NY venues, playing saxophone and a variety of reeds, duck calls, tapes, and other instruments.Pareles, J., Concert: Sounds of Staley And Zorn, NY Times, December 4, 1983 He founded a performance art project called the Theatre of Musical Optics in 1975 and became a major participant in the downtown music scene as a composer, performer, and producer of music that challenged the confines of any single musical genre.Troyano, E., John Zorn's Theatre of Musical Optics in The Drama Review: TDR, Vol. 23, No. 4, Private Performance Issue December, 1979, pp.&nbsp;37–44. Zorn's early major compositions included several game pieces described as "complex systems harnessing improvisers in flexible compositional formats".Zorn, J.

Zorn's game pieces were often titled after sports, and include Track & Field (1974), Baseball (1976), Lacrosse (1976), Dominoes (1977), Curling (1977), Golf (1977), Hockey (1978), Cricket (1978), Fencing (1978), Pool (1979), and Archery (1979), several of which were recorded and originally released on Eugene Chadbourne's Parachute label, becoming the first albums under Zorn's leadership.Poop, C.

Zorn's first solo saxophone (and duck call) recordings were originally released in two volumes as The Classic Guide to Strategy in 1983 and 1986 on the Lumina label.Proefrock, S. Allmusic Review: The Classic Guide to Strategy, accessed November 1, 2013 Zorn's early small group improvisations are documented on Locus Solus (1983) which featured Zorn with various combinations of other improvisers including Christian Marclay, Arto Lindsay, Wayne Horvitz, Ikue Mori, and Anton Fier.Layne, J. Allmusic Review: Locus Solas, accessed November 1, 2013 Ganryu Island featured a series of duets by Zorn with Satoh Michihiro on shamisen, which received limited release on the Yukon label in 1984.Layne, J. Allmusic Review: Ganryu Island, accessed November 1, 2013 Zorn has subsequently released these recordings as CDs on Tzadik making them more widely available than the original vinyl pressings.Tzadik complete catalog by date, accessed November 1, 2013 Zorn's breakthrough recording was 1985's widely acclaimed The Big Gundown: John Zorn Plays the Music of Ennio Morricone, where Zorn offered radical arrangements of themes from The Big Gundown (1966), Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), A Fistful of Dynamite (1971), and Once Upon a Time in America (1984), that incorporated elements of traditional Japanese music, soul jazz, and other diverse musical genres.Yanow, S. Allmusic Review: The Big Gundown, accessed November 1, 2013 The Big Gundown was endorsed by Morricone, who is quoted as saying: "This is a record that has fresh, good and intelligent ideas. It is realization on a high level, a work done by a maestro with great science-fantasy and creativity&nbsp;... Many people have done versions of my pieces, but no one has done them like this".Morricone, E. in liner notes to The Big Gundown – 15th Anniversary Edition Tzadik: New York Zorn followed this with his second major-label release Spillane in 1987, which included performances by Albert Collins and the Kronos Quartet, and the extended title track, one of Zorn's file-card compositions, which featured text by Arto Lindsay set to an array of sonic film noir references.Watrous, P. John Zorn Makes Radical Turn Chic, NY Times, September 16, 1993. This method of combining composition and improvisation involved  Zorn writing descriptions or ideas on file-cards and arranging them to form the piece.Cook, R. & Morton, B. (1992), The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD, LP and Cassette, Penguin Books Zorn described the process in 2003: "I write in moments, in disparate sound blocks, so I find it convenient to store these events on filing cards so they can be sorted and ordered with minimum effort. Pacing is essential. If you move too fast, people tend to stop hearing the individual moments as complete in themselves and more as elements of a sort of cloud effect&nbsp;... I worked 10 to 12 hours a day for a week, just orchestrating these file cards. It was an intense process." Zorn's file-card method of organizing sound blocks into an overall structure largely depended on the musicians he chose, the way they interpreted what was written on the file cards, and their relationship with Zorn. "I'm not going to sit in some ivory tower and pass my scores down to the players." said Zorn, "I have to be there with them, and that's why I started playing saxophone, so that I could meet musicians. I still feel that I have to earn a player's trust before they can play my music. At the end of the day, I want players to say: this was fun—it was a lot of fucking work, and it's one of the hardest things I've ever done, but it was worth the effort." Two other critically acclaimed releases on Nonesuch followed; Spy vs Spy in 1989, and Naked City in 1990, before Zorn left the label. Beginning in 1986 Zorn participated in several projects focused on the compositions of modern jazz musicians which highlighted his unique saxophone style. These included Voodoo (1986) by the Sonny Clark Memorial Quartet, and Spy vs Spy (1989) featuring hardcore punk-informed interpretations of Ornette Coleman's music with Tim Berne.Yanow, S.

While Zorn is often labelled a jazz musician his schema is considerably broader. He stated: "The term 'jazz', per se, is meaningless to me in a certain way. Musicians don't think in terms of boxes. I know what jazz music is. I studied it. I love it. But when I sit down and make music, a lot of things come together. And sometimes it falls a little bit toward the classical side, sometimes it falls a little bit towards the jazz, sometimes it falls toward rock, sometimes it doesn't fall anywhere, it's just floating in limbo. But no matter which way it falls, it's always a little bit of a freak. It doesn't really belong anywhere. It's something unique, it's something different, it's something out of my heart. It's not connected with those traditions." "But the music is not jazz music, it's not classical music, it's not rock music. It's a new kind of music&nbsp;... So I feel like that created a deep misunderstanding in what this music is. People started judging this new music with the standards of jazz, with the definitions of what jazz is and isn't, because stories about it appeared in jazz magazines. And now I'll do a gig at the Marciac Jazz Festival and I'll get offstage and Wynton Marsalis will say, 'That's not jazz.' And I'll say, 'You're right! But this is the only gig I've got, man. Give me another festival and I'll play there.'"Milkowski, B. John Zorn: The Working Man, Jazz Times, May 2009 Zorn has written music for documentaries, underground films, television advertisements and cartoons which were released in his Filmworks series on the Tzadik label. Some of these film scores are jazz-influenced, others classical, and most feature ensembles consisting of rotating combinations of downtown musicians. Zorn has often used his cinematic and television commissions to experiment with line-ups and forms that would become more established parts of his musical canon. Zorn only agrees to composing for film on the condition he retains all rights to any music produced and ensures that all musicians participating in his soundtrack work are appropriately remunerated. Zorn stated that "After my record The Big Gundown came out I was convinced that a lot of soundtrack work was going to be coming my way".Zorn, J.

Allmusic Review: Filmworks 1986–1990, accessed November 6, 2013 Zorn did attract the interest of filmmaker Walter Hill who contracted him to compose music for a film to be called Looters. The film was finally released in 1992 as Trespass (1992) featuring a score by Ry Cooder.

Zorn stated that "Naked City started with rhythm and blues/Spillane type things then went into this hard-core thing&nbsp;... because I was living in Japan and experiencing a lot of alienation and rejection&nbsp;...

John Zorn-Masada, Pitchfork Media, March 5, 2006 The Wire observed that "The degree to which John Zorn—composer, saxophonist, jazz musician, label organiser, conceptualiser—has polarised opinion is remarkable even in a field where polarised opinions are hardly rare".Hopkins, S. John Zorn Primer, The Wire, February 1997 Zorn created controversy with his use of confronting images on a number of his albums. The cover of the eponymous album by his Naked City band used the Weegee photograph "Corpse with Revolver C.A. 1940", which shows a gangland killing as did their later live album.Album credits – Naked City (album) (1990) and Naked City, Live, Vol. 1: Knitting Factory 1989 (2002).

Jazz: Who What Where Why, New York Press, September 7, 2005. A 1999 NY Times article by Adam Shatz accused Zorn of "attempt[ing] to recast Jewishness as a defiantly marginalized identity—to claim victim status—[which] has an air of calculation about it that overpowers his music."Shatz, A. Crossing Music's Borders In Search Of Identity; Downtown, a Reach For Ethnicity NY Times, October 3, 1999. Several letters to the Editor from critics and musicians appeared in the following weeks in defence of Zorn's artistic intent.

And for that, he should be lauded, not dissected and discounted so readily".Milkowski, B. John Zorn: His Own Scene, NY Times, October 17, 1999 Jazziz editor, Larry Blumfield, observed that Zorn felt "that every time he had opened the door to the press, his words had been used to hurt him".Blumenfeld, L. John Zorn; Words That Hurt NY Times, October 17, 1999. Fellow musician Dave Douglas stated "An article that purported to be about music had veered into an examination of the validity of Mr. Zorn's interest in Jewish culture and identity, expressing a disbelief that there could be anything more than empty posturing behind it".Douglas, D. John Zorn; Ignoring the Music NY Times, October 17, 1999. The character of Stephen Colbert from the TV show The Colbert Report mocked the MacArthur Foundation's award of the Genius Grant to Zorn on the September 20, 2006 episode in his segment titled "Who's Not Honoring Me Now". Colbert used a 10-second dissonant excerpt from the 50th Birthday Celebration Series and compared it to his blowing into a saxophone, pleading, "Genius Grant please!""Who's Not Honoring Me Now: MacArthur Grants" Colbert Report, Comedy Central Zorn's comments on the Colbert segment were "It was hilarious!" By 2008 Zorn expressed a reluctance to grant interviews and requested that journalists not review his performance.Hooper, M. Catch of the Day: John Zorn Hates Critics, The Guardian Music Blog, March 5, 2008 Journalist Howard Mandel wrote "He's of the opinion, I'm afraid, that music journalists are ill-informed and demeaning, unnecessary and maybe parasitical, not just unsupportive but actually obstacles to the realization of musicians' potentials".Mandel, H. Musicians Dread Words, Jazz Beyond Jazz, March 2, 2008. Upon turning 60 in an interview for NPR Zorn reflected "I used to read reviews and I would be unable to write a note of music for months at a time, because some guy I don't even know who doesn't know me didn't like my work? Now I can look at it and say, 'You didn't like it? Well, there are many people who do'.
