    Trajan (; ;Trajan's regal name had an equivalent English meaning of "Commander Caesar Nerva Trajan, son of the Divine Nerva, the Emperor" September 18, 53 – August 8, 117 AD) was Roman emperor from 98 AD until his death in 117 AD. Officially declared by the Senate optimus princeps ("the best ruler"), Trajan is remembered as a successful soldier-emperor who presided over the greatest military expansion in Roman history, leading the empire to attain its maximum territorial extent by the time of his death. He is also known for his philanthropic rule, overseeing extensive public building programs and implementing social welfare policies, which earned him his enduring reputation as the second of the Five Good Emperors who presided over an era of peace and prosperity in the Mediterranean world. Born in the city of Italica in the province of Hispania Baetica, Trajan's non-patrician family was of Italian and perhaps Iberian origin.Julian Bennett, Trajan: Optimus Princeps, 2nd Edition, Routledge 2000, 11. Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of emperor Domitian. Serving as a legatus legionis in Hispania Tarraconensis, in 89 Trajan supported Domitian against a revolt on the Rhine led by Antonius Saturninus.Benett, Julian (1997). Trajan. Optimus Princeps. Routledge, pp. 30–31 In September 96, Domitian was succeeded by Marcus Cocceius Nerva, an old and childless senator who proved to be unpopular with the army. After a brief and tumultuous year in power, culminating in a revolt by members of the Praetorian Guard, Nerva was compelled to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor. He died on 27 January 98 and was succeeded by his adopted son without incident. As a civilian administrator, Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program, which reshaped the city of Rome and left numerous enduring landmarks such as Trajan's Forum, Trajan's Market and Trajan's Column. Early in his reign, he annexed the Nabataean kingdom, creating the province of Arabia Petraea. His conquest of Dacia enriched the empire greatly, as the new province possessed many valuable gold mines. However, its exposed position north of the Danube made it susceptible to attack on three sides, and it was later abandoned by Emperor Aurelian. Trajan's war against the Parthian Empire ended with the sack of the capital Ctesiphon and the annexation of Armenia and Mesopotamia. His campaigns expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent. In late 117, while sailing back to Rome, Trajan fell ill and died of a stroke in the city of Selinus. He was deified by the Senate and his ashes were laid to rest under Trajan's Column. He was succeeded by his adopted son Hadrian. As an emperor, Trajan's reputation has endured&nbsp;– he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries. Every new emperor after him was honored by the Senate with the wish felicior Augusto, melior Traiano (that he be "luckier than Augustus and better than Trajan"). Among medieval Christian theologians, Trajan was considered a virtuous pagan, while the 18th-century historian Edward Gibbon popularized the notion of the Five Good Emperors, of whom Trajan was the second. However, as far as literary sources are concerned, an extant continuous account of Trajan's reign does not exist. Book&nbsp;68 in Cassius Dio's Roman History, which survives mostly as Byzantine abridgments and epitomes, is the best source for the political history of Trajan's rule. Besides this, Pliny the Younger's Panegyricus and Dio of Prusa's orations are the best surviving contemporary sources. Both are adulatory perorations, typical of the late Roman era, that describe an idealized monarch and an equally idealized view of Trajan's rule, and concern themselves more with ideology than with actual fact.Bennett, Trajan, xii/xiii and 63 The Tenth Volume of Pliny's letters contains his correspondence with Trajan, which deals with various aspects of Imperial Roman government, but this correspondence is neither intimate nor candid: it is an exchange of official mail, in which Pliny's stance borders on the servile.Finley Hooper, Roman Realities. Wayne State University Press, 1979, ISBN 0-8143-1594-1 , page 427 Therefore, discussion of Trajan and his rule in modern historiography cannot avoid speculation, as well as recourse to non-literary sources such as archaeology and epigraphy.Bennett, Trajan, xiii  Marcus Ulpius Traianus was born on 18&nbsp;September 53&nbsp;AD in the Roman province of Hispania BaeticaSyme, Tacitus, 30–44; PIR Vlpivs 575 (in what is now Andalusia in modern Spain), in the city of Italica (now in the municipal area of Santiponce, in the outskirts of Seville). Although frequently designated the first provincial emperor, and dismissed by later writers like Cassius Dio "an Iberian, and neither an Italian nor even an Italiot", Trajan appears to have hailed, at least on his father's side, from the area of Tuder (modern Todi) in in northern Umbria. Trajan's birthplace of Italica was founded as a Roman military colony in 206 BC, although it is unknown when the Ulpii arrived there. It is possible, but cannot be substantiated, that Trajan's ancestors married local women and lost their citizenship at some point, but they certainly recovered their status when the city became a municipium with Latin citizenship in the mid-1st century BC.Bennett, Trajan, 1–3Arnold Blumberg, Great Leaders, Great Tyrants? Contemporary Views of World Rulers who Made History, 1995, Greenwood Publishing Group, p.315: "Trajan is frequently but misleadingly designated the first provincial emperor, because the Ulpii were from Baetica (southern Spain). The family, resident in Spain for some time, originated in Italian Tuder, not far from the Flavian home of Reate. The emperor's father, M. Ulpius Traianus, was an early adherent of Vespasian and perhaps the old family friend. This Trajan evidently married a Marcia (her name is inferred from that of their daughter Marciana) whose family owned brickyards in the vicinity of Ameria, near both Reate and Tuder. She was possibly an older sister of Marcia Furnilla, second wife of Vespasian's son Titus. Further, Ulpia, sister of the senior Trajan, was a grandmother of Hadrian. In other words, the emperor Trajan was succeeded in 117 by his cousin, member of another Italian family resident in Baetica." Trajan was the son of Marcia and Marcus Ulpius Traianus, a prominent senator and general from the gens Ulpia. Marcus Ulpius Traianus the elder served Vespasian in the first Jewish war, commanding the X&nbsp;Fretensis legion. Trajan himself was just one of many well-known Ulpii in a line that continued long after his own death. His elder sister was Ulpia Marciana, and his niece was Salonina Matidia. The patria of the Ulpii was Italica, in Spanish Baetica, where their ancestors had settled late in the 3rd&nbsp;century BC. As a young man, he rose through the ranks of the Roman army, serving in some of the most contentious parts of the Empire's frontier. In 76–77, Trajan's father was Governor of Syria (Legatus pro praetore Syriae), where Trajan himself remained as Tribunus legionis. From there, after his father's replacement, he seems to have been transferred to an unspecified Rhine province, and Pliny implies that he engaged in active combat duty during both commissions.Julian Bennett, Trajan: Optimus Princeps. Bloomington: Indiana U. Press, 2001, ISBN 0-253-21435-1 , pages 22/23. In about 86, Trajan's cousin P.&nbsp;Aelius Afer died, leaving his young children Hadrian and Paulina orphans. Trajan and a colleague of his, Publius Acilius Attianus, became co-guardians of the two children, raising them in their respective households. Around 91, Trajan was nominated as Consul, and he brought Apollodorus of Damascus with him to Rome.Augustan History, Life of Hadrian 2.5–6. Around this time he married Pompeia Plotina, a noble woman from the settlement at Nîmes; the marriage ultimately remained childless. It is not clear that Trajan was actively predisposed towards homosexuality, as bisexual activity was common among Roman men of the period, and so his homosexual activities could be interpreted as nothing more than a functional aspect of his class. Nevertheless, Cassius Dio makes reference to them, and Trajan's putative lovers included Hadrian and the pages of the imperial household, the actor Pylades, a dancer called Apolaustus, and possibly Licinius Sura and Nerva.Bennett, 58 As the details of Trajan's military career are obscure, it is only sure that in 89, as legate of Legio VII Gemina in Hispania Tarraconensis, he supported Domitian against an attempted coup.Bennett, 43. Later, he held some unspecified consular commission as governor on either Pannonia or Germania Superior &ndash; possibly both. Pliny attributes to him, at the time, various (and uspecified) feats of arms.Bennett, 45/46 As Domitian's successor, Nerva was unpopular with the army and had just been forced by his Praetorian Prefect Casperius Aelianus to execute Domitian's killers,Richard Alston, Aspects of Roman History 31BC-AD117. Abingdon: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-0-415-61120-6 , page 261 he felt the need to do something in order to avoid ousting by gaining the support of the military. He accomplished this in the summer of 97 by naming Trajan as his adoptive son and successor, allegedly solely on Trajan's outstanding military merits. There are hints, however, in contemporary literary sources that Trajan's adoption was imposed on Nerva. Pliny implied as much when he wrote that, although an emperor could not be coerced into doing something, if this were the way in which Trajan was raised to power, then it was worth it. If this was what actually occurred, Trajan would be a usurper, and the notion of a natural continuity between Nerva's and Trajan's reigns would be an ex post fiction developed later by historians such as Tacitus.Jason König,Tim Whitmarsh, eds., Ordering Knowledge in the Roman Empire. Cambridge University Press, 2007, ISBN 978-0-521-85969-1 , page 180 According to the Augustan History, it was the future Emperor Hadrian who brought word to Trajan of his adoption. Hadrian was then retained on the Rhine frontier by Trajan as a military tribune, becoming privy to the circle of friends and relations with which Trajan hedged himself&nbsp;– among them the then governor of Germania Inferior, the Spaniard Lucius Licinius Sura, who would become Trajan's chief personal adviser and official friend.John D. Grainger, Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96–99. Abingdon: Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-415-34958-3 , pages 91 and 109 As a token of his influence, Sura would later become consul for the third time in 107; some ancient sources also tell about his having built a bath named after him on the Aventine Hill, or having this bath built by Trajan and then named after him; in either case, a signal honor, the only exception to the established rule that a public building in the Roman Empire could be dedicated only to a member of the imperial family.Garrett G.

Levick, Faustina I and II: Imperial Women of the Golden Age.Oxford University Press, 2014, ISBN 978-0-19-537941-9 , page 42 According to a modern historian, Sura's role as kingmaker and éminence grise was deeply resented by some senators, especially the historian Tacitus, who acknowledged Sura's military and oratory virtues but at the same time resented his rapacity and devious ways, similar to those of Vespasian's éminence grise Licinius Mucianus.Eugen Cizek, "Tacite face à Trajan", available at [ ], pages 127/128. Retrieved July 20, 2014 When Nerva died on 27&nbsp;January 98, Trajan succeeded to the role of emperor without any outward incident. However, the fact that he chose not to hasten towards Rome, but instead to make a lengthy tour of inspection on the Rhine and Danube frontiers, hints to the possible fact that his power position in Rome was unsure and that he first had to assure himself of the loyalty of the armies at the front. It is noteworthy that Trajan ordered Prefect Aelianus to attend him in Germany, where he was apparently executed ("put out of the way"),Grainger, 111 with his post being taken by Attius Suburanus.Bennett, 52 Trajan's accession, therefore, would qualify more as a successful coup than an orderly succession.Alston, 262  On his entry at Rome, Trajan granted the plebs a direct gift of money. The traditional donative to the troops, however, was reduced by half.Alston, 200 and 206 There remained the issue of the strained relations between the emperor and the Senate, especially after the supposed bloodiness that had marked Domitian's reign and his dealings with the Curia. By playing on a motif of feigned reluctance to hold power, Trajan was able to start building a consensus around him in the Senate.Roger Rees, ed. , Latin Panegyric. Oxford University Press, 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-957671-5 , page 198 His belated ceremonial entry into Rome in 99 was notably low-key, something on which Pliny the Younger elaborated.Peter V.

London, Routledge, 2002, ISBN 0-203-03625-5 Trajan appeared as conforming to the idea (developed by Pliny) that an emperor derived his legitimacy from his adherence to traditional senatorial morals and traditional hierarchies.Anastasia Serghidou, Fear of slaves, fear of enslavement in the ancient Mediterranean.

New York: Continuum, 2012, ISBN 978-1-4411-2052-6, page 131 In the inaugural for his third consulship, on 1&nbsp;January 100, Trajan would exhort the Senate to share with him the caretaking of the Empire&nbsp;– an event later celebrated on a coin.Rees, 121; Veyne, L"Empire Gréco-Romain,Paris: Seuil, 2005, ISBN 2-02-057798-4 ,page 402 Trajan did not share power in any meaningful way with the Senate, something that Pliny admits candidly: "everything depends on the whims of a single man who, in behalf of the common welfare, has taken upon himself all functions and all tasks".Letters III, 20, 12, quoted by Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain, 38, footnote 108. One of the most salient traits of his reign was his encroachment on the Senate's sphere of authority, as when he made the senatorial provinces of Achaea and Bythinia into imperial ones in order to deal with the inordinate spending on public works by local magnates,Kathleen Kuiper, ed., Ancient Rome: From Romulus and Remus to the Visigoth Invasion. New York: Rosen Publishing Group, 2010, ISBN 978-1-61530-207-9 , page 128 and with general mismanagement of provincial affairs by various proconsuls appointed by the Senate.M.S.

Accessed January 20, 2015 However, in the formula developed by Pliny, Trajan was a "good" emperor in that, by himself, he approved or blamed the same things the Senate would have approved or blamed.Paul Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain, 37 If in reality Trajan was an autocrat, his deferential behavior towards his peers qualified him to the role of virtuous monarch.Ryan K. Balot, ed., A Companion to Greek and Roman Political Thought.John Wiley & Sons, 2012, The whole idea was that Trajan wielded autocratic power through moderatio instead of contumacia&nbsp;– moderation instead of insolence.Roger Rees, ed., Latin Panegyric, Oxford University Press, 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-957671-5 , page 137 In short, according to the ethics for autocracy developed by most political writers of the Imperial Roman Age, Trajan was a good ruler in that he ruled less by fear, and mostly by means of acting as a role model, for, according to Pliny, "men learn better from examples".Carlos F. Noreña, "The Ethics of Autocracy in the Roman World". IN Ryan K. Balot, ed., A COMPANION TO GREEK AND ROMAN POLITICAL THOUGHT. Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2009, ISBN 978-1-4051-5143-6 , page 277 Eventually, Trajan's popularity among his peers was such that the Roman Senate bestowed upon him the honorific of optimus, meaning "the best",Bernard W.

Dio, as a Greek notable and intellectual with friends in high places, and possibly an official friend to the emperor (amicus caesaris)&nbsp;– saw Trajan as a defender of the status quo.Christopher J. Fuhrmann, Policing the Roman Empire: Soldiers, Administration, and Public Order.Oxford University Press, 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-973784-0 , page 175; Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain, 241 In his third kingship oration, Dio describes an ideal king ruling by means of "friendship"&nbsp;– that is, through patronage and a network of local notables who act as mediators between the ruled and the ruler.Joshua Rice, Paul and Patronage: The Dynamics of Power in 1 Corinthians. Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2013, ISBN 978-1-62032-557-5 , pages 84 sqq. As a senatorial Emperor, Trajan was inclined to choose his local basis of political support among the members of the ruling urban oligarchies. In the West, that meant local senatorial families like his own. In the East, that meant the Greek notables' families. The Greeks, however, had their own memories of independence&nbsp;– as well as their commonly acknowledged cultural superiority&nbsp;– and disdained Roman rule instead of seeing themselves as Roman as did their Western counterparts.Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain, 195/196 What the Greek oligarchies wanted from Rome was, above all, to be left in peace and to be allowed to concentrate on their local interests&nbsp;– something the Romans were not inclined to do, as they felt the Greeks were shunning their responsibilities in the management of Imperial affairs. An outstanding example of this Greek alienation was the personal role played by Dio of Prusa in his relationship with Trajan.

Competition between Greek cities and their ruling oligarchies had to do mostly with marks of preeminence, specially for titles bestowed by the Roman emperor.

London, Routledge, 1992, ISBN 0-415-08621-3 , page 185.

According to Pliny, the best way to achieve this was to lower the minimum age for holding a seat on the council, making it possible for more sons of the established oligarchical families to join and thus contribute to civic spending; this was seen as preferable to enrolling non-noble wealthy upstarts.G.

Concern about independent local political activity is seen in Trajan's decision to forbid Nicomedia from having a corps of firemen ("If people assemble for a common purpose&nbsp;... they soon turn it into a political society", Trajan wrote Pliny) as well as in his and Pliny's fears about excessive civic generosities by local notables such as distribution of money and/or gifts.Benjamin Isaac, 487; Albino Garzetti, From Tiberius to the Antonines: A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192.

According to the provisions of this treaty, Decebalus was acknowledged as rex amicus, that is, client king; nevertheless, in exchange for accepting client status, he received a generous stipend from Rome, as well as being supplied with technical experts.Michael Schmitz, The Dacian Threat, 101–106 AD.

It was not a decisive victory,Patrick Le Roux, Le Haut-Empire Romain en Occident, d'Auguste aux Sévères. Paris: Seuil, 1998, ISBN 2-02-025932-X , page 73 however. Trajan's troops were mauled in the encounter, and he put off further campaigning for the year to let the troops heal, reinforce, and regroup.  During the following winter, King Decebalus took the initiative by launching a counter-attack across the Danube further downstream, supported by Sarmatian cavalry,José Maria Blázquez,  Las res gestae de Trajano militar: las guerras dácicas. Aquila Legionis, 6 (2005) 19 forcing Trajan to come to the aid of the troops in his rearguard. The Dacian invasion was repulsed after two battles in Moesia: in Nicopolis ad Istrum and Adamclisi.Ioan Glodariu, LA ZONE DE SARMIZEGETUSA REGIA ET LES GUERRES DE TRAJAN.

Decebalus had to renounce claim to some regions of his kingdom, return all Roman runaways (most of them technical experts), and surrender all his war machines. Trajan returned to Rome in triumph and was granted the title Dacicus Maximus. The victory was celebrated by the Tropaeum Traiani. Although the peace of 102 had restored him to the condition of more or less harmless client king, Decebalus, after being left to his own devices, began to rearm, to harbor Roman runaways anew, as well as to pressure his Western neighbors, the Iazyges Sarmatians, into allying themselves to him. In 104, he devised a failed attempt on Trajan's life by mean of some Roman deserters, and held prisoner Trajan's legate Longinus&nbsp;– who eventually poisoned himself while in custody. Finally, in 105, Decebalus undertook an invasion of Roman-occupied territory north of the Danube.Stephen Dando-Collins, Legions of Rome: The definitive history of every Roman legion. London: Quercus, 2012, ISBN 978-1-84916-230-2 Prior to the campaign, Trajan had already raised two entirely new legions: II Traiana&nbsp;– which, however, may have been posted in the East, at the Syrian port of Laodicea&nbsp;– and XXX Ulpia Victrix, which was posted to Brigetio, in Pannonia.Dando-CollinsIn the absence of literary references, however, the positioning of the new legions is conjectural: some scholars think that Legio II Traiana Fortis was originally stationed on the Lower Danube and participated in the Second Dacian War, being only later deployed to the East:cf.

He commissioned either the creation or enlargement of the road along the Iron Gates carved into the side of the gorge.Wiseman, James 1997 "Beyond the Danube's Iron Gates." Archaeology 50(2): 24–9. Additionally, Trajan commissioned a canal to be built around the rapids of the Iron Gates. Evidence of this comes from a marble slab discovered near Caput Bovis, the site of a Roman fort. The slab, dated to the year 101, commemorates the building of at least one canal that went from the Kasajna tributary to at least Ducis Pratum, whose embankments were still visible until recently. However, the placement of the slab at Caput Bovis suggests that the canal extended to this point or that there was a second canal downriver of the Kasajna-Ducis Pratum one.Šašel, Jaroslav. 1973  "Trajan's Canal at the Iron Gate."

Finley, ed., Classical Slavery, London: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 0-7146-3320-8 , page 122 Trajan's Dacian campaigns benefited the Empire's finances through the acquisition of Dacia's gold mines, managed by an imperial procurator of equestrian rank (procurator aurariarum).Le Roux, 241 Agricultural exploitation on the villa model, on the contrary, was poorly developed.Le Roux, 242 Similarly, slave labor in the province itself seems to have been relatively undeveloped, and epigraphic evidence points to work in the gold mines being conducted by means of labor contracts (locatio conductio rei) and seasonal wage-earning.Steven A. Epstein, Wage Labor and Guilds in Medieval Europe. UNC Press, 1991, ISBN 0-8078-1939-5 , page 26; Paul du Plessis, Studying Roman Law. Bllomsbury Publishing, 2014, page 82 The victory was commemorated by the construction of Trajan's Column, which depicts in stone carved bas-reliefs the Dacian Wars' most important moments. At about the same time, Rabbel II Soter, one of Rome's client kings, died. This event might have prompted the annexation of the Nabataean kingdom, but the manner and the formal reasons for the annexation are unclear. Some epigraphic evidence suggests a military operation, with forces from Syria and Egypt. What is known is that by 107, Roman legions were stationed in the area around Petra and Bostra, as is shown by a papyrus found in Egypt. The furthest south the Romans occupied (or, better, garrisoned, adopting a policy of having garrisons at key points in the desert)Maurice Sartre, 46 was Hegra, over  south-west of Petra.Bennett, Trajan, 177 The empire gained what became the province of Arabia Petraea (modern southern Jordan and north west Saudi Arabia).Bennett, Trajan, 172–182 As Nabataea was the last client kingdom in Asia west of the Euphrates, the annexation meant that the entire Roman East had been provincialized, completing a trend towards direct rule that had begun under the Flavians.Sartre, 46  For the next seven years, Trajan ruled as a civilian emperor, to the same acclaim as before. It was during this time that he corresponded with Pliny the Younger on the subject of how to deal with the Christians of Pontus, telling Pliny to continue to persecute Christians but not to accept anonymous denounciations in the interests of justice as well as of "the spirit of the age". People who admitted to their being Christians and refused to recant, however, were to be executed "for obstinacy" when non-citizens, and sent to Rome for trial if they were Roman citizens.Stephen Benko, Pagan Rome and the Early Christians. Bloomington: Indiana U. Press, 1986, ISBN 0-253-20385-6 , pages 6/7 Trajan built several new buildings, monuments and roads in Italia and his native Hispania. His magnificent complex in Rome raised to commemorate his victories in Dacia (and largely financed from that campaign's loot) – consisting of a forum, Trajan's Column, and Trajan's Market still stands in Rome today. He was also a prolific builder of triumphal arches, many of which survive, and a rebuilder of roads (Via Traiana and Via Traiana Nova). One of Trajan's notable acts during this period was the hosting of a three-month gladiatorial festival in the great Colosseum in Rome (the precise date of this festival is unknown). Combining chariot racing, beast fights and close-quarters gladiatorial bloodshed, this gory spectacle reputedly left 11,000 dead (mostly slaves and criminals, not to mention the thousands of ferocious beasts killed alongside them) and attracted a total of five million spectators over the course of the festival. The care bestowed by Trajan on the managing of such public spectacles led the orator Fronto to state approvingly that Trajan had paid equal attention to entertainments as well as to serious issues. Fronto concluded that "neglect of serious matters can cause greater damage,  but neglect of amusements greater discontent".Quoted by Andrea Giardina, ed. THe Romans. University of Chicago Press, 1993, ISBN 0-226-29049-2, page 272 In 107 he devalued the Roman currency. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 93.5% to 89% – the actual silver weight dropping from 3.04&nbsp;grams to 2.88&nbsp;grams. This devaluation, coupled with the massive amount of gold and silver carried off after Trajan's Dacian Wars, allowed the emperor to mint a larger quantity of denarii than his predecessors. Also, Trajan withdrew from circulation silver denarii minted before the previous devaluation achieved by Nero, something that allows for thinking that Trajan's devaluation had to do with political ends, such as allowing for increased civil and military spending.Paul Petit, Pax Romana. Berkeley: U. of California Press, 1976, ISBN 0-520-02171-1 , page 188 Another important act was his formalisation of the alimenta, a welfare program that helped orphans and poor children throughout Italy. It provided general funds, as well as food and subsidized education. The program was supported initially by funds from the Dacian War, and then later by a combination of estate taxes and philanthropy. In general terms, the scheme functioned by means of mortgages on Italian farms (fundi), through which registered landowners received a lump sum from the imperial treasure, being in return engaged to pay yearly a given proportion of the loan to the maintenance of the alimentary fund.John Rich,Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, eds., City and Country in the Ancient World. London: Routledge, 2003, ISBN 0-203-41870-0, page 158 Although the system is well documented in literary sources and contemporary epigraphy, its precise aims are controversial and have generated considerable dispute among modern scholars, especially about its actual aims and scope as a piece of welfare policy. It is usually assumed that the program was intended to bolster citizen numbers in Italy, following the provisions of Augustus' moral legislation (Lex Julia) favoring procreation on moral grounds&nbsp;– something openly acknowledged by Pliny.Judith Evans Grubbs,Tim Parkin, eds., The Oxford Handbook of Childhood and Education in the Classical World, Oxford University Press, 2014, ISBN 978-0-19-978154-6, page 344 Nevertheless, as an aim this was in itself anachronistic, in that it saw the Roman Empire as a hegemony centering on a purely Italian manpower base.Paul Veyne:Le Pain et le Cirque, Paris: Seuil, 1976, ISBN 2-02-004507-9 , page 654 This anachronistic stance is confirmed by Pliny, when he wrote that the recipients of the alimenta were supposed to people "the barracks and the tribes" as future soldiers and electors&nbsp;– two roles ill-fitted to the contemporary reality of a Mediterranean hegemony ruled by an autocracy.Veyne, Le Pain at le Cirque, Eng. trans., A. Lane, 1990, pg.372 The fact that the scheme was restricted to Italy points to the fact that it might be conceived as a form of political privilege accorded to the heartland of the Roman Empire.José María Blanch Nougués, Régimen jurídico de las fundaciones en derecho romano. Madrid: Dykinson, 2007, ISBN 978-84-9772-985-7 , page  151 According to the French historian Paul Petit, the alimenta should be seen as part of a set of measures aimed towards the economic recovery of Italy, such as the stricture laid down by Trajan ordering all senators, even when from the provinces, to have at least a third of their landed estates in Italian territory.Paul Petit, Pax Romana, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976, ISBN 0-520-02171-1 , page 76 Besides, the fact that the scheme was subsidized by means of interest payments on loans made by landowners&nbsp;– and mostly large ones, assumed to be more reliable debtorsRichard Duncan-Jones, The Economy of the Roman Empire: Quantitative Studies. Cambridge University Press: 1982, ISBN 0-521-24970-8 , page 297&nbsp;– actually restricted it to a small percentage of potential welfare recipients (Paul Veyne has assumed that, in the city of Veleia, only one child out of ten was an actual beneficiary). Therefore, the idea, advanced by Moses I. Finley, that the whole scheme was at most a form of random charity, a mere imperial benevolenceM.I. Finley, Ancient Economy, 201/203&nbsp;– and that the fact that these charities seem to have been backed by loans to great landowners only (in Veleia, only some 17&nbsp;square kilometers were mortgaged)Luuk de Ligt,S. J.

It seems that the mortgage scheme was simply a way of making local notables participate, albeit in a lesser role, in imperial benevolence.Julián González, ed. Trajano Emperador De Roma: Atti Del Congresso. Siviglia 1998, 14–17 Settembre. Rome : L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER, 2000, ISBN 88-8265-111-8 , page 297 It is possible that the scheme was, to some extent, a forced loan, something that tied unwilling landowners to the imperial fisc in order to make then supply some funds to civic expenses.Susan R. Holman, The Hungry Are Dying : Beggars and Bishops in Roman Cappadocia. Oxford University Press, 2001, ISBN 0-19-513912-7, page 117 On the other hand, a senator such as Pliny had endowed his city of Comum a perpetual right to an annual charge (vectigal) of thirty thousand sestertii on one of his estates, allowing for the maintenance of his, Pliny's, private charitable foundation.Duncan-Jones, 298/299 The fact that the alimenta scheme was developed during and after the Dacian Wars, and followed two distributions of money to the population of Rome (congiaria) during Dacian triumphs, points towards the purely charitable character of the scheme.Suzanne Dixon, ed., Childhood, Class and Kin in the Roman World. London: Routledge, 2005, ISBN 0-415-23578-2 , page 26   In 113, Trajan embarked on his last campaign, provoked by Parthia's decision to put an unacceptable king on the throne of Armenia, a kingdom over which the two great empires had shared hegemony since the time of Nero some fifty years earlier. As the surviving literary accounts of Trajan's Parthian War are fragmentary and scattered,R. P. Longden, "Notes on the Parthian Campaigns of Trajan". The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 21 (1931), pp. 1–35. Available at [ ]. Retrieved November 15, 2014 it is difficult to assign them a proper context, something that has led to a long-running controversy about its precise happenings and ultimate aims. Many modern historians consider that Trajan's decision to wage war against Parthia might have had economic motives: after Trajan's annexation of Arabia, he built a new road, Via Traiana Nova, that went from Bostra to Aila on the Red Sea.Steven E. Sidebotham, Roman Economic Policy in the Erythra Thalassa: 30 B.C. – A.D. 217. Leiden: Brill, 1986, ISBN 90-04-07644-1 , page 154 That meant that Charax on the Persian Gulf was the sole remaining western terminus of the Indian trade route outside direct Roman control,Christol & Nony, Rome, 171 and such control was important in order to lower import prices and to limit the supposed drain of precious metals created by the deficit in Roman trade with the Far East.Gary K. Young, Rome's Eastern Trade: International Commerce and Imperial Policy 31 BC – AD 305. London: Routledge, 2001, ISBN 0-203-47093-1, page 181 That Charax traded with the Roman Empire, there can be no doubt, as its actual connections with merchants from Palmyra at the period are well documented in contemporary Palmyrene epigraph, which tells of various Palmyrene citizens honored for holding office in Charax.Daniel T. Potts, ed., Araby the Blest: Studies in Arabian Archaeology. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1988, ISBN 87-7289-051-7 , page 142 Also, Charax's rulers domains at the time possibly included the Bahrain islands (where a Palmyrene citizen held office, shortly after Trajan's death, as satrapPaul Veyne, L'Empire Gréco-Romain, 279&nbsp;– but then, the appointment was made by a Parthian king of CharaxJulian Reade, ed.,The Indian Ocean In Antiquity. London: Routledge, 2013, ISBN 0-7103-0435-8, page 279) something which offered the possibility of extending Roman hegemony into the Persian Gulf itself.Potts, 143 The rationale behind Trajan's campaign, in this case, would be one of breaking down a system of Far Eastern trade through small Semitic ("Arab") cities under Parthia's control and to put it under Roman control instead.George Fadlo Hourani, Arab Seafaring in the Indian Ocean in Ancient and Early Medieval Times. Princeton University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-691-00170-7, page 15 In his Dacian conquests, Trajan had already resorted to Syrian auxiliary units, whose veterans, along with Syrian traders, had an important role in the subsequent colonization of Dacia.Găzdac, 59 He had recruited Palmyrene units into his army, including a camel unitPat Southern, Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2008, ISBN 978-1-84725-034-6 , page 25&nbsp;– therefore apparently procuring Palmyrene support to his ultimate goal of annexing Charax. It has even been ventured that, when earlier in his campaign Trajan annexed Armenia, he was bound to annex the whole of Mesopotamia lest the Parthians interrupt the flux of trade from the Persian Gulf and/or foment trouble at the Roman frontier on the Danube.Freya Stark, Rome on the Euphrates: The Story of a Frontier.London: I.B. Tauris, 2012, ISBN 978-1-84885-314-0, page 211 Other historians reject these motives, as the supposed Parthian "control" over the maritime Far Eastern trade route was, at best, conjectural and based on a selective reading of Chinese sources&nbsp;– trade by land through Parthia seems to have been unhampered by Parthian authorities and left solely to the devices of private enterprise.Gary K. Young, Rome's Eastern Trade, pages 176 sqq. Commercial activity in second century Mesopotamia seems to have been a general phenomenon, shared by many peoples within and without the Roman Empire, with no sign of a concerted Imperial policy towards it.Finley, The Ancient Economy, 158 As in the case of the alimenta, scholars like Moses Finley and Paul Veyne have considered the whole idea of a foreign trade "policy" behind Trajan's war anachronistic: according to them, the sole Roman concern with the Far Eastern luxuries trade&nbsp;– besides collecting toll taxes and customsPaul Erdkamp, The Grain Market in the Roman Empire: A Social, Political and Economic Study. Cambridge University Press, 2005, ISBN 978-0-521-83878-8 , page 5&nbsp;– was moral and involved frowning upon the "softness" of luxuries, but no economic policy.Finley, The Ancient Economy, 132; Paul Veyne, La Société Romaine , Paris: Seuil, 2001, ISBN 2-02-052360-4, Chapter 5 In his controversial book on the Ancient economy, Finley considers Trajan's "badly miscalculated and expensive assault on Parthia" to be an example of Roman "commercial wars" that had in common the fact of existing only in the books of modern historians.Finley, Ancient Economy, 158 The alternative view is to see the campaign as triggered by the lure of territorial annexation and prestige, the sole motive ascribed by Cassius Dio.Quoted by Bennett, Trajan, 188 As far as territorial conquest involved tax-collecting,Michael Alexander Speidel: "Bellicosissimus Princeps".

London: Continuum, 2010, ISBN 978-1-84725-235-7 , page 130 Also, it is possible that the attachment of Trajan to an expansionist policy was supported by a powerful circle of conservative, war hawk senators from Hispania, among them Licinius Sura.Françoise Des Boscs-Plateaux, Un parti hispanique à Rome?: ascension des élites hispaniques et pouvoir politique d'Auguste à Hadrien, 27 av.

Leiden: Brill, 2012, ISBN 978-90-04-23593-9 , page 262 Finally, there are other modern historians who think that Trajan's original aims were purely military and quite modest: to assure a more defensible Eastern frontier for the Roman Empire, crossing Northern Mesopotamia along the course of the Khabur River in order to offer cover to a Roman Armenia.Luttvak, Grand Strategy, 108 The campaign was carefully planned in advance: ten legions were concentrated in the Eastern theater; since 111, the correspondence of Pliny the Younger witnesses to the fact that provincial authorities in Bithynia had to organize supplies for passing troops, and local city councils and their individual members had to shoulder part of the increased expenses by supplying troops themselves.Fergus Millar, The Roman Near East, 31 B.C. – A.D. 337.

De Laet, review of Lepper, Trajan's Parthian War. L'Antiquité Classique, 18-2, 1949, pages 487–489 The chronology of subsequent events is uncertain, but it is generally believed that early in 115 Trajan launched a Mesopotamian campaign, marching down towards the Taurus mountains in order to consolidate territory between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. He placed permanent garrisons along the way to secure the territory. While Trajan moved from west to east, Lusius Quietus moved with his army from the Caspian Sea towards the west, both armies performing a successful pincer movement,Bennett, 195 whose apparent result was to establish a Roman presence into the core Parthian hegemony, with Trajan taking the northern Mesopotamian cities of Nisibis and Batnae and organizing a province of Mesopotamia, including the Kingdom of Osrhoene&nbsp;– where King Abgaros&nbsp;VII submitted to Trajan publiclyMaurice Sartre,The Middle East Under Rome. Harvard University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-674-01683-1, page 146. According to Cassius Dio, the deal between Trajan and Abgaros was sealed by the king's son offering himself as Trajan's paramour—Bennett, 199&nbsp;– as a Roman protectorate.Bennett, 199 This process seems to have been completed at the beginning of 116, when coins were issued announcing that Armenia and Mesopotamia had been put under the authority of the Roman people.Bennett, Trajan, 196; Christol & Nony, Rome,171 The area between the Khabur River and the mountains around Singara seems to have been considered as the new frontier, and as such received a road surrounded by fortresses.Petit, Pax Romana, 44   After wintering in Antioch during 115/116 &nbsp;– and, according to literary sources, barely escaping from a violent earthquake that claimed the life of one of the consuls, M.&nbsp;Pedo VirgilianusFergus Millar, The Roman Near East, 31 B.C. – A.D. 337.

According to some modern historians, the aim of the campaign of 116 was to achieve a "preemptive demonstration" aiming not toward the conquest of Parthia, but for tighter Roman control over the Eastern trade route. However, the overall scarcity of manpower for the Roman military establishment meant that the campaign was doomed from the start.Patrick Le Roux, IN Ségolène Demougin, ed., H.-G. Pflaum, un historien du XXe siècle: actes du colloque international, Paris les 21, 22 et 23 octobre 2004. Geneva: Droz, 2006, ISBN 2-600-01099-8 , pages 182/183 It is noteworthy that no new legions were raised by Trajan before the Parthian campaign, maybe because the sources of new citizen recruits were already over-exploited.Petit, Pax Romana, 45 As far as the sources allow a description of this campaign, it seems that one Roman division crossed the Tigris into Adiabene, sweeping south and capturing Adenystrae; a second followed the river south, capturing Babylon; Trajan himself sailed down the Euphrates from Dura-Europos&nbsp;– where a triumphal arch was erected in his honour&nbsp;– through Ozogardana, where he erected a "tribunal" still to be seen at the time of Julian the Apostate's campaigns in the same area. Having come to the narrow strip of land between the Euphrates and the Tigris, he then dragged his fleet overland into the Tigris, capturing Seleucia and finally the Parthian capital of Ctesiphon.Bennett, Trajan, 197/199; Anthony R Birley, Hadrian: The Restless Emperor. Abingdon: Routledge, 2013, ISBN 0-415-16544-X , page 72 He continued southward to the Persian Gulf, when, after escaping with his fleet a tidal bore on the Tigris,Longden, "Notes on the Parthian Campaigns", 8 he received the submission of Athambelus, the ruler of Charax. He declared Babylon a new province of the Empire and had his statue erected on the shore of the Persian Gulf,T. Olajos, "Le monument du triomphe de Trajan en Parthie. Quelques renseignements inobservés (Jean d'Ephèse, Anthologie Grecque XVI 72)". Acta Antiqua Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, 1981, vol. 29, no1-4, pp. 379–383. The statue was torn down by Sassanids in 571/572 after which he sent the Senate a laurelled letter declaring the war to be at a close and bemoaning that he was too old to go on any further and repeat the conquests of Alexander the Great. Since Charax was a de facto independent kingdom whose connections to Palmyra were described above, Trajan's bid for the Persian Gulf may have coincided with Palmyrene interests in the region.Peter Edwell, Between Rome and Persia: The Middle Euphrates, Mesopotamia and Palmyra Under Roman Control. London: Routledge, 2007, ISBN 0-203-93833-X, page 21 Another hypothesis is that the rulers of Charax had expansionist designs on Parthian Babylon, giving them a rationale for alliance with Trajan.E. J. Keall, Parthian Nippur and Vologases' Southern Strategy: A Hypothesis. Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 95, No. 4 (Oct. – Dec., 1975), pp. 620–632 The Parthian summer capital of Susa was apparently also occupied by the Romans.George Rawlinson, Parthia. New York: Cosimo, 2007, ISBN 978-1-60206-136-1 , page 310 According to late literary sources (not backed by numismatic or inscriptional evidence) a province of Assyria was also proclaimed,Christopher S. Mackay, Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History.Cambridge University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-521-80918-5 , page 227 apparently covering the territory of Adiabene.Various authors have discussed the existence of the province and its location: André Maricq (La province d'Assyrie créée par Trajan. A propos de la guerre parthique de Trajan. In: Maricq: Classica et orientalia, Paris 1965, pages 103/111) identifies Assyria with Southern Mesopotamia; Chris S. Lightfood ("Trajan's Parthian War and the Fourth-Century Perspective", Journal of Roman Studies 80, 1990, pages 115–126), doubts the actual existence of the province; Maria G. Angeli Bertinelli ("I Romani oltre l'Eufrate nel II secolo d. C. - le provincie di Assiria, di Mesopotamia e di Osroene", In Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt, Bd. 9.1, Berlin 1976, pages 3/45) puts Assyria between Mesopotamia and Adiabene; Lepper (1948, page 146) considers Assyria and Adiabene to be the same province. Some measures seem to have been considered regarding the fiscal administration of Indian trade&nbsp;– or simply about the payment of customs (portoria) on goods traded on the Euphrates and Tigris.Luttvak, Grand Strategy, 110; Peter Edwell, Between Rome and Persia, 21 It is possible that it was this "streamlining" of the administration of the newly conquered lands according to the standard pattern of Roman provincial administration in tax collecting, requisitions and the handling of local potentates' prerogatives, that triggered later resistance against Trajan.Janos Harmatta and others, eds., History of Civilizations of Central Asia: The development of sedentary and nomadic civilizations, 700 B.C. to A.D. 250. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1999, ISBN 81-208-1408-8, page 135 According to some modern historians, Trajan might have busied himself during his stay on the Persian Gulf with ordering raids on the Parthian coasts,Pirouz Mojtahed-Zadeh, Security and Territoriality in the Persian Gulf: A Maritime Political Geography,London: Routledge, 2013, ISBN 0-7007-1098-1, page 120 as well as probing into extending Roman suzerainty over the mountaineer tribes holding the passes across the Zagros Mountains into the Iranian Plateau eastward, as well as establishing some sort of direct contact between Rome and the Kushan Empire.Choisnel, 164/165 No attempt was made to expand into the Iranian Plateau itself, where the Roman army, with its relative weakness in cavalry, would be at a disadvantage.Axel Kristinsson, Expansions: Competition and Conquest in Europe Since the Bronze Age. Reykjavik:  ReykjavíkurAkademían, 2010, ISBN 978-9979-9922-1-9 , page 129  However, as Trajan left the Persian Gulf for Babylon&nbsp;– where he intended to offer sacrifice to Alexander in the house where he had died in 323&nbsp;BCBennett, Trajan, 199&nbsp;– a sudden outburst of Parthian resistance, led by a nephew of the Parthian king, Sanatruces, who had retained a cavalry force, possibly strengthened by the addition of Saka archers,Kaveh Farrokh, Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War. Oxford: Osprey, 2007, ISBN 978-1-84603-108-3 , page 162 imperilled Roman positions in Mesopotamia and Armenia, something Trajan sought to deal with by forsaking direct Roman rule in Parthia proper, at least partially.Bennett, Trajan, 200 Trajan sent two armies towards Northern Mesopotamia: the first, under Lusius Quietus, recovered Nisibis and Edessa from the rebels, probably having King Abgarus deposed and killed in the process, while a second, under Appius Maximus Santra (probably a governor of Macedonia), was defeated, with Santra being killed.Julián González, ed. , Trajano Emperador De Roma, 216 Later in 116, Trajan, with the assistance of Quietus and two other legates, M. Erucius Clarus and Tiberius Julius Alexander Julianus,The last two were made consuls (suffecti) for the year 117González, 216 defeated a Parthian army in a battle where Sanatruces was killed. After re-taking and burning Seleucia, Trajan then formally deposed the Parthian king Osroes I and put his own puppet ruler Parthamaspates on the throne. This event was commemorated in a coin so as to be presented as the reduction of Parthia to client kingdom status: REX PARTHIS DATUS, "a king is given to the Parthians".Theodor Mommsen, A History of Rome Under the Emperors. London: Routledge, 1999, page 289 That done, Trajan retreated north in order to retain what he could of the new provinces of Armenia&nbsp;– where he had already accepted an armistice in exchange for surrendering part of the territory to Sanatruces' son VologesesBennett, Trajan,203&nbsp;– and Mesopotamia.  It was at this point that Trajan's health started to fail him. The fortress city of Hatra, on the Tigris in his rear, continued to hold out against repeated Roman assaults. He was personally present at the siege, and it is possible that he suffered a heat stroke while in the blazing heat. Shortly afterwards, the Jews inside the Eastern Roman Empire, in Egypt, Cyprus and Cyrene&nbsp;– this last province being probably the original trouble hotspot&nbsp;– rose up in what probably was an outburst of religious rebellion against the local pagans, this widespread rebellion being afterwards named the Kitos War.James J. Bloom, The Jewish Revolts Against Rome, A.D. 66–135: A Military Analysis. McFarland, 2010, page 191 Another rebellion flared up among the Jewish communities of Northern Mesopotamia, probably part of a general reaction against Roman occupation.Bloom, 194 Trajan was forced to withdraw his army in order to put down the revolts. He saw this withdrawal as simply a temporary setback, but he was destined never to command an army in the field again, turning his Eastern armies over to Lusius Quietus, who meanwhile had been made governor of Judaea and might have had to deal earlier with some kind of Jewish unrest in the province.A precise description of events in Judaea at the time being impossible, due to the non-historical character of the Jewish (rabbinic) sources, and the silence of the non-Jewish ones: William David Davies,Louis Finkelstein,Steven T. Katz, eds., The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 4, The Late Roman–Rabbinic Period.Cambridge U. Press, 2006, ISBN 978-0-521-77248-8 ,page 100 Quietus discharged his commission successfully, so much that the war was afterward named after him&nbsp;– Kitus being a corruption of Quietus.Bloom, 190 Quietus was promised a consulateHe was already consul in absentia: Tanja Gawlich, Der Aufstand der jüdischen Diaspora unter Traian. GRIN Verlag, 2007, ISBN 978-3-640-32753-9, page 11 in the following year (118) for his victories, but he was killed before this could occur, during the bloody purge that opened Hadrian's reign, in which Quietus and three other former consuls were sentenced to death after being tried on a vague charge of conspiracy by the (secret) court of the Praetorian Prefect Attianus.Margret Fell, ed., Erziehung, Bildung, Recht. Berlim: Dunker & Hunblot, 1994, ISBN 3-428-08069-6 , page 448 It has been theorized that Quietus and his colleagues were executed on Hadrian's direct orders, for fear of their popular standing with the army and their close connections to Trajan.Histoire des Juifs, Troisième période, I – Chapitre III – Soulèvement des Judéens sous Trajan et Adrien In contrast, the next prominent Roman figure in charge of the repression of the Jewish revolt, the equestrian Quintus Marcius Turbo, who had dealt with the rebel leader from Cyrene, Loukuas,Bloom, 195/196 retained Hadrian's trust, eventually becoming his Praetorian Prefect. Apparently, Hadrian could not allow the continued existence alongside him of a group of independent-minded senatorial generals inherited from his predecessor.Hoyos, A Companion to Roman Imperialism, 325 As all four consulars were senators of the highest standing and as such generally regarded as able to take imperial power (capaces imperii), Hadrian seems to have decided on a preemptive strike against these prospective rivals.Gabriele Marasco, ed., Political Autobiographies and Memoirs in Antiquity: A Brill Companion. Leiden: Brill, 2011, ISBN 978-90-04-18299-8 , page 377   Early in 117, Trajan grew ill and set out to sail back to Italy. His health declined throughout the spring and summer of 117, something publicly acknowledged by the fact that a bronze bust displayed at the time in the public baths of Ancyra showed him clearly aged and emaciated.Bennett, Trajan, 201 By the time he had reached Selinus (modern Gazipasa) in Cilicia, which was afterwards called Trajanopolis, he suddenly died from edema on 8&nbsp;August. Some say that Trajan had adopted Hadrian as his successor, but others that it was his wife Pompeia Plotina who assured the succession to Hadrian by keeping his death secret and afterwards hiring someone to impersonate Trajan by speaking with a tired voice behind a curtain, well after Trajan had died. Dio, who tells this narrative, offers his father&nbsp;– the then governor of Cilicia Apronianus&nbsp;– as a source, and therefore his narrative is possibly grounded on contemporary rumor, or maybe on common Roman displeasure at an empress meddling in political affairs.Francesca Santoro L'Hoir, Tragedy, Rhetoric, and the Historiography of Tacitus' Annales.University of Michigan Press, 2006, ISBN 0-472-11519-7 , page 263 Hadrian held an ambiguous position during Trajan's reign: after commanding Legio I Minervia during the Dacian Wars, he had been relieved from front-line duties at the decisive stage of the Second Dacian War, being sent to govern the newly created province of Pannonia Inferior;Birley,50 & 52 had pursued a senatorial career without particular distinction; had not been officially adopted by Trajan (although he received from him decorations and other marks of distinction that made him hope for the succession);Birley, 52 received no post after his 108 consulate,Françoise Des Boscs-Plateaux, Un parti hispanique à Rome?, 306 with no other honors than being made Archon eponymos for Athens in 111/112;Birley, 64 and had probably not taken part in the Parthian War. The literary sources tell that Trajan had considered others, such as the jurist Neratius Priscus, as heir.Birley, 50 However, Hadrian was eventually entrusted with the governorship of Syria at the time of Trajan's death, was Trajan's cousin, and was married to Trajan's grandniece,Christopher S. Mackay, Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History. Cambridge University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-521-80918-5 , page 229 all making him as good as heir designate.Petit, Pax Romana, 53 Besides, Hadrian was born in Hispania and seems to have been well connected with the powerful group of Spanish senators influential at Trajan's court through his ties to Plotina and the Prefect Attianus.Françoise Des Boscs-Plateaux, Un parti hispanique à Rome?, 307 The fact that Hadrian during his reign did not pursue Trajan's senatorial policy can account for the "crass hostility" shown him by literary sources.Garzetti, From Tiberius to the Antonines, 379 Aware that the Parthian campaign was an enormous setback, and that it revealed that the Roman Empire had no means for an ambitious program of conquests,Christol & Nony, 171The German historian Mommsen, who was no lover of Hadrian - "a repellent manner , and a venomous, envious and malicious nature" - at the same time acknowledged that, in renouncing to Trajan's conquests, Hadrian was "doing what the situation clearly required". Mommsen, A History of Rome Under the Emperors. London: Routledge, 2005, page 290 Hadrian's first act as emperor was to abandon&nbsp;– outwardly out of his own free willAccording to Historia Augusta, Hadrian declared that he was following the precedent set by Cato the Elder towards the Macedonians, who "were to be set free because they could not be protected" – something Birley  sees as an unconvincing precedent: Birley, 78&nbsp;– the distant and indefensible Mesopotamia and to restore Armenia, as well as Osrhoene, to the Parthian hegemony under Roman suzerainty. However, all the other territories conquered by Trajan were retained. Roman friendship ties with Charax (also known by the name of Mesene) were also retained (although it is debated whether this had to do more with trade concessions than with common Roman policy of exploiting dissensions amid the Empire's neighbors).D. S. Potter, The Inscriptions on the Bronze Herakles from Mesene: Vologeses IV's War with Rome and the Date of Tacitus' "Annales". Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik Bd. 88, (1991), pp. 277–290; Young, Rome's Eastern Trade, 132 Trajan's ashes were laid to rest underneath Trajan's column, the monument commemorating his success. Trajan was a prolific builder in Rome and the provinces, and many of his buildings were erected by the gifted architect Apollodorus of Damascus. Notable structures include Trajan's Column, Trajan's Forum, Trajan's Bridge, Alcántara Bridge, the road and canal around the Iron Gates (see conquest of Dacia), and possibly the Alconétar Bridge. Some historians also attribute the construction of the Babylon fortress in Egypt to Trajan; the remains of the fort is what is now known as the Church of Mar Girgis and its surrounding buildings. In order to build his forum and the adjacent brick market that also held his name Trajan had vast areas of the surrounding hillsides leveled. Unlike many lauded rulers in history, Trajan's reputation has survived undiminished for nearly nineteen centuries. Ancient sources on Trajan's personality and accomplishments are unanimously positive. Pliny the Younger, for example, celebrates Trajan in his panegyric as a wise and just emperor and a moral man. Cassius Dio added that he always remained dignified and fair.Dio Cassius, Epitome of Book 6; 21.2–3 After the setbacks of the third century, Trajan, together with Augustus, became in the Later Roman Empire the paragon of the most positive traits of the Imperial order.Karl Strobel, Das Imperium Romanum im "3. Jahrhundert": Modell einer historischen Krise? Zur Frage mentaler Strukturen breiterer Bevölkerungsschichten in der Zeit von Marc Aurel bis zum Ausgang des 3. Jh.n.Chr. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1993, ISBN 3-515-05662-9, page 319 The Christianisation of Rome resulted in further embellishment of his legend: it was commonly said in medieval times that Pope Gregory I, through divine intercession, resurrected Trajan from the dead and baptized him into the Christian faith. An account of this features in the Golden Legend. Some theologians such as Thomas Aquinas discussed Trajan as an example of a virtuous pagan. In the Divine Comedy, Dante, following this legend, sees the spirit of Trajan in the Heaven of Jupiter with other historical and mythological persons noted for their justice. Also, a mural of Trajan stopping to provide justice for a poor widow is present in the first terrace of Purgatory as a lesson to those who are purged for being proud. He also features in Piers Plowman. An episode referred to as the justice of Trajan was reflected in several art works. In the 18th-century King Charles III of Spain commissioned Anton Raphael Mengs to paint The Triumph of Trajan on the ceiling of the banquet hall of the Royal Palace of Madrid&nbsp;– considered among the best works of this artist. It was only during the Enlightenment that this legacy began to be contested, when Edward Gibbon expressed doubts about the militarized character of Trajan's reign in contrast to the "moderate" practices of his immediate successors.Robert Mankin, "Edward Gibbon: Historian in Space", A Companion to Enlightenment Historiography, Leiden: Brill, 2013, page 34 Mommsen adopted a divided stance towards Trajan, at some point of his posthumously published lectures even speaking about his "vainglory" (Scheinglorie).Mommsen, A History of Rome Under the Emperors, page 488 Mommsen also speaks of Trajan's "insatiable, unlimited lust for conquest".Römische Kaisergeschichte. Munich: 1992, page 389. It was exactly this military character of Trajan's reign that attracted his early twentieth century biographer, the Italian Fascist historian Roberto Paribeni, who in his 1927 two volume biography Optimus Princeps described Trajan's reign as the acme of the Roman principate, which he saw as Italy's patrimony.A. G. G. Gibson, ed. Robert Graves and the Classical Tradition. Oxford University Press, 2015, ISBN 978-0-19-873805-3 ,pages 257/258 Following in Paribeni's footsteps, the German historian Alfred Heuss saw in Trajan "the accomplished human embodiment of the imperial title"(die ideale Verkörperung des humanen Kaiserbegriffs).Alfred Heuß: Römische Geschichte, 4. Braunschweig 1976, pages 344ff. Trajan's first English-language biography by Julian Bennett is also a positive one in that it assumes that Trajan was an active policy-maker concerned with the management of the empire as a whole&nbsp;– something his reviewer Lendon considers an anachronistic outlook that sees in the Roman emperor a kind of modern administrator.J.E. Lendon, "Three Emperors and the Roman Imperial Regime", The Classical Journal 94 (1998) pp. 87–93 During the 1980s, the Romanian historian Eugen Cizek took a more nuanced view as he described the changes in the personal ideology of Trajan's reign, stressing the fact that it became ever more autocratic and militarized, especially after 112 and towards the Parthian War (as "only an universal monarch, a kosmocrator, could dictate his law to the East").Richard Jean-Claude, "Eugen Cizek, L'époque de Trajan.

Retrieved December 13, 2015. The biography by the German historian Karl Strobel stresses the continuity between Domitian's and Trajan's reigns, saying that Trajan's rule followed the same autocratic and sacred character of Domitian's, culminating in a failed Parthian adventure intended as the crown of his personal achievement.Jens Gering, Rezension zu: Karl Strobel, Kaiser Traian&nbsp;– Eine Epoche der Weltgeschichte,Frankfurter elektronische Rundschau zur Altertumskunde 15 (2011), [ ]. Retrieved December&nbsp;15, 2015. It is in modern French historiography that Trajan's reputation becomes most markedly deflated: Paul Petit writes about Trajan's portraits as a "lowbrow boor with a taste for booze and boys".Petit, Histoire Générale de L'Empire Romain, 1: Le Haut Empire (27 av. J.C.- 161 apr. J.C.). Paris: Seuil, 1974, ISBN 978-2-02-004969-6, page 166 For Paul Veyne, what is to be retained from Trajan's "stylish" qualities was that he was the last Roman emperor to think of the empire as a purely Italian and Rome-centered hegemony of conquest. In contrast, his successor Hadrian would stress the notion of the empire as ecumenical and of the Emperor as universal benefactor and not kosmocrator.Veyne, Le Pain et le Cirque, 654/655       |-                   Ancel, R.
