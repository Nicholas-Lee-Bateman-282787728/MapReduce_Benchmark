   St.&nbsp;Gallen, or sometimes Sankt Gallen (; ; ; ; ) is the capital of the canton of St.&nbsp;Gallen in Switzerland. It evolved from the hermitage of Saint Gall, founded in the 7th century. Today, it is a large urban agglomeration (with around 160,000 inhabitants) and represents the center of eastern Switzerland. The town mainly relies on the service sector for its economic base. The main tourist attraction is the Abbey of Saint Gall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its renowned library contains books which date back to the 9th century. The official language of St.&nbsp;Gallen is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect. The city has good transport links to the rest of the country and to neighbouring Germany and Austria. It also functions as the gate to the Appenzell Alps. St.&nbsp;Gallen is situated in the northeastern part of Switzerland in a valley about  above sea level. It is one of the highest cities in Switzerland and it often receives a lot of snow in winter. The city is pleasantly situated between Lake Constance and the mountains of the Appenzell Alps (with the Säntis as the highest peak at ). It therefore offers excellent recreation areas nearby. As the city center is built on an unstable turf ground (its founder Gallus was looking for a site for a hermitage, not for a city), all buildings on the valley floor must be built on piles. For example, the entire foundation of the train station and its plaza are based on hundreds of piles. St.&nbsp;Gallen has an area, , of . Of this area, 31.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 28.9% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 38.4% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (1.7%) is non-productive (rivers or lakes).    The founding of St.&nbsp;Gallen is attributed to the Irish monk Gallus (ca 550–620 or 640), who built a hermitage by the river Steinach in 612 AD. Around 720, one hundred years after Gallus's death, the Alemannian priest Othmar built a monastery and gave it the name monasterium sancti Gallonis (monastery of Saint Gall). In 719, its first abbot Otmar extended it to an abbey. In 926 Hungarian raiders attacked the abbey and surrounding town. Saint Wiborada, the first woman formally canonized by the Vatican, reportedly saw a vision of the impending attack and warned the monks and citizens to flee. While the monks and the abbey treasure escaped, Wiborada chose to stay behind and was killed by the raiders. Between 924 and 933 the Magyars threatened the abbey and the books had to be removed to Reichenau for safety. Not all the books were returned. On 26 April 937 a scholar kindled a fire and the abbey and the adjoining settlement were almost completely destroyed; the library was undamaged, however. About 954 they started to protect the monastery and buildings by a sourrounding wall. Around 971/974 abbot Notker finalized the walling and the adjoining settlements started to become the town of St&nbsp;Gall. In 1207, Abbot Ulrich von Sax was granted the rank of Imperial Prince (Reichsfürst) by Philip of Swabia, King of the Germans . As an ecclesiastical principality, the Abbey of St.&nbsp;Gallen was to constitute an important territorial state and a major regional power in Northern Switzerland up to 1803 when it lost its independence and was incorporated into the new Canton of St.&nbsp;Gallen.http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D8394.php The city of St.&nbsp;Gallen proper progressively freed itself from the rule of the abbot, acquiring Imperial immediacy, and by the late 15th century was recognized as a Free imperial city. By about 1353 the guilds, headed by the cloth-weavers guild, gained control of the civic government. In 1415 the city bought its liberty from the German king Sigismund. In 1405, the Appenzell estates of the abbot successfully rebelled and in 1411 they became allies of the Old Swiss Confederation. A few months later, the town of St.&nbsp;Gallen also became an ally. They joined the "everlasting alliance" as full members of the Confederation in 1454 and in 1457 became completely free from the abbot. However, in 1451 the abbey became an ally of Zurich, Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus who were all members of the Confederation. Ulrich Varnbüler was one of the earliest mayors of St.&nbsp;Gallen and perhaps one of the most colorful. Hans, the father of Ulrich, was prominent in city affairs in St.&nbsp;Gallen in the early 15th century. Ulrich entered public affairs in the early 1460s and gathered the various offices and honours that are available to a talented and ambitious man. He demonstrated fine qualities as field commander of the St.&nbsp;Gallen troops in the Burgundian Wars. In the Battle of Grandson (1476) he and his troops were part of the advance units of the Confederation and took part in their famous attack. A large painting of Ulrich returning triumphantly to a hero's welcome in St.&nbsp;Gallen is still displayed in St.&nbsp;Gallen. After the war, Varnbüler often represented St.&nbsp;Gallen at the various parliaments of the Confederation. In December 1480, Varnbüler was offered the position of mayor for the first time. From that time on, he served in several leadership positions and was considered the city's intellectual and political leader. According to Vadian, who understood his contemporaries well, "Ulrich was a very intelligent, observant, and eloquent man who enjoyed the trust of the citizenry to a high degree." His reputation among the Confederates was also substantial. However, in the late 1480s, he became involved in a conflict that was to have serious negative consequences for him and for the city.   In 1463, Ulrich Rösch had assumed the management of the abbey of Saint Gall. He was an ambitious prelate, whose goal was to return the abbey to prominence by every possible means, following the losses of the Appenzell War. His restless ambition offended the political and material interests of his neighbours. When he arranged for the help of the Pope and the Emperor to carry out a plan to move the abbey to Rorschach on Lake Constance, he encountered stiff resistance from the St.&nbsp;Gallen citizenry, other clerics, and the Appenzell nobility in the Rhine Valley, who were concerned for their holdings. At this point, Varnbüler entered the conflict against the prelate. He wanted to restrain the increase of the abbey's power and at the same time increase the power of the town that had been restricted in its development. For this purpose he established contact with farmers and Appenzell residents (led by the fanatical Hermann Schwendiner) who were seeking an opportunity to weaken the abbot. Initially, he protested to the abbot and the representatives of the four sponsoring Confederate cantons (Zurich, Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus) against the construction of the new abbey in Rorschach. Then on July 28, 1489 he had armed troops from St.&nbsp;Gallen and Appenzell destroy the buildings already under construction. When the Abbot complained to the Confederates about the damage and demanded full compensation, Ulrich responded with a countersuit, and in cooperation with Schwendiner rejected the arbitration efforts of the non-partisan Confederates. He motivated the clerics from Wil to Rorschach to abandon their loyalty to the abbey and spoke against the abbey at the meeting of the townspeople at Waldkirch, where the popular league was formed. He was confident that the four sponsoring cantons would not intervene with force, due to the prevailing tensions between the Confederation and the Swabian League. He was strengthened in his resolve when the people of St.&nbsp;Gallen re-elected him as their highest magistrate in 1490. Ulrich Varnbüler had made a serious miscalculation. In early 1490, the four cantons decided to carry out their duty to the abbey and to invade the St.&nbsp;Gallen canton with an armed force. The people of Appenzell and the local clerics submitted to this force without significant resistance, while the city of St.&nbsp;Gallen braced itself for a fight to the finish. However, when they learned that their compatriots had given up the fight, they lost confidence; and they agreed to a settlement that greatly restricted the city's power and burdened the city with serious penalties and reparation payments. Ulrich, overwhelmed by the responsibility for his political decisions, panicked in the face of the approaching enemy who wanted him apprehended. His life was in great danger, and he was forced to escape from the city disguised as a messenger. He made his way to Lindau and to Innsbruck and the court of King Maximilian. The victors confiscated those of his properties that lay outside of the city of St.&nbsp;Gallen and banned him from the Confederation. Ulrich then appealed to the imperial court (as did Schwendiner, who had fled with him) for the return of his property. The suit had the support of Friedrich II and Maximilian and the trial threatened to drag on for years: it was continued by Ulrich's sons Hans and Ulrich after his death in 1496, and eventually the Varnbülers regained their properties. However, other political ramifications resulted from the court action, because the Confederation gained ownership of the city of St.&nbsp;Gallen and rejected the inroads of the empire. Thus, the conflict strengthened the relationship between the Confederation and the city of St.&nbsp;Gallen. On the other hand, the matter deepened the alienation between Switzerland and the German Holy Roman Empire, which would eventually lead to a total separation as a result of the Swabian War. Despite the unpropitious end of his career, Ulrich Varnbüler is immortalized in a famous woodcut by Albrecht Dürer, which is now part of the Smithsonian Institution's woodcut collection. Among Varnbüler's sons, the eldest (Hans/Johann) became the mayor of Lindau. He is the patriarch of the Baden and Württemberg Varnbülers. Starting in 1526 then-mayor and humanist Joachim von Watt (Vadian) introduced the reformation into the city of St.&nbsp;Gallen. The town converted to the new reformed religion while the abbey remained Roman Catholic.  While iconoclastic riots forced the monks to flee the city and remove images from the city's churches, the fortified abbey remained untouched.Switzerland is yours.com-St. Gallen History accessed 20 November 2008 The abbey would remain a Catholic stronghold in the Protestant city until 1803. In 1798 Napoleon invaded the Old Swiss Confederation destroying the Ancien Régime. Under the Helvetic Republic both the abbey and the city lost their power and were combined with Appenzell into the Canton of Säntis. The Helvetic Republic was widely unpopular in Switzerland and was overthrown a few years later in 1803. Following the Act of Mediation the city of St.&nbsp;Gallen became the capital of the Protestant Canton of St.&nbsp;Gallen. One of the first acts of the new canton was to suppress the abbey. The monks were driven out of the abbey with the last abbot dying in Muri in 1829. In 1846 a rearrangement in the local dioceses made St. Gall a separate diocese, with the abbey church as its cathedral and a portion of the monastic buildings being designated the bishop's residence. Gustav Adolf, former king of Sweden, spent the last years of his life in St.&nbsp;Gallen, and finally died there in 1837.  In the 15th century, St.&nbsp;Gallen became well known for producing quality textiles. In 1714, the zenith was reached with a yearly production of 38,000 pieces of cloth. The first depression occurred in the middle of the 18th century, caused by strong foreign competition and reforms in methods of cotton production. But St.&nbsp;Gallen recovered and an even more prosperous era arrived. At the beginning of the 19th century, the first embroidery machines were developed in St.&nbsp;Gallen. In 1910 the embroidery production constituted the largest export branch (18% of the total export value) in Switzerland and more than half of the worldwide production of embroidery originated in St.&nbsp;Gallen. One fifth of the population of the eastern part of Switzerland was involved with the textile industry. However, World War I and the Great Depression caused another severe crisis for St. Gallen embroidery. Only in the 1950s did the textile industry recover somewhat. Nowadays, because of competition and the prevalence of computer-operated embroidery machines, only a reduced textile industry has survived in St.&nbsp;Gallen; but St.&nbsp;Gallen embroidered textiles are still popular with Parisian haute couture designers.  St.&nbsp;Gallen is known for its business school, now named the University of St. Gallen (HSG). It was ranked as the top business school in Europe by Wirtschaftswoche, a weekly German business news magazine, and is highly ranked by several other sources.University of St Gallen, International MBA rankings accessed 29 April 2009 Recently, HSG has been building a reputation for Executive Education, with its International MBA recognised as one of Europe's leading programmes,  mentions that there are only 7 "true" German MBA with international appeal, of which HSG is one and runs a PhD programme.University of St Gallen, Doctoral programs accessed 29 April 2009 HSG is a focused university that offers degrees in business and management, economics, political science and international relations as well as business law.University of St Gallen portal accessed 29 April 2009 The Master in Management course was Ranked number 1 in 2014 by The Financial Times ahead of HEC Paris.[ ] Financial Times Masters in Management Rankings 2014  It is comparatively small, with about 6,500 students enrolled at present, has both EQUIS and AACSB accreditations, and is a member of CEMS (Community of European Management Schools).University of St Gallen-MBA Programme accessed 29 April 2009 The university maintains student and faculty exchange programs around the world.

St.&nbsp;Gallen is notable for reporting the highest maximum radioactivity measurements of any Swiss city, as published in the 2009 yearly report by BAG (Bundesamt für Gesundheit), the Swiss Federal Health Office. While the daily average level of gamma-ray radioactivity in the city is unremarkable at 105 nSv/h, the maximum can reach 195 nSv/h, as high as the average for Jungfraujoch, the location with the highest reported level of radioactivity in Switzerland, due to its high elevation and therefore greater exposure to cosmic rays. The same report explains that the unusually high spikes of radioactivity measured in St.&nbsp;Gallen are due to radioactive products of radon gas being washed to the ground during heavy rain or storms, but does not explain where the sufficient quantities of radon gas and its products to account for the anomaly would come from.Jahresberichte Umweltradioaktivität und Strahlendosen.
