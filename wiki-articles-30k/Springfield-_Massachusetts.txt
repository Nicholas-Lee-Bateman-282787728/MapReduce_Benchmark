    Springfield is a city in Western New England, and the seat of Hampden County, Massachusetts, United States. Springfield sits on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River near its confluence with three rivers: the western Westfield River, the eastern Chicopee River, and the eastern Mill River. As of the 2010 Census, the city's population was 153,060. Metropolitan Springfield, as one of two metropolitan areas in Massachusetts (the other being Greater Boston), had an estimated population of 698,903 as of 2009.July 1, 2009, estimated:  The first Springfield in the New World, it is the largest city in Western New England, and the urban, economic, and cultural capital of Massachusetts' Connecticut River Valley (colloquially known as the Pioneer Valley). It is the third-largest city in Massachusetts and fourth-largest in New England, after Boston, Worcester, and Providence, Rhode Island. Springfield has several nicknames&nbsp;– The City of Firsts, because of its many innovations (see below for a partial list); The City of Homes, due to its Victorian residential architecture; and Hoop City, as basketball&nbsp;– one of the world's most popular sports&nbsp;– was invented in Springfield by James Naismith. Hartford, the capital city of the State of Connecticut, lies only  south of Springfield, on the western bank of the Connecticut River.

In 1641 it was renamed after Pynchon's hometown of [[Springfield, Essex]], England, following incidents that precipitated the settlement joining the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].<ref>Barrows, Charles Henry (1911). ''The history of Springfield in Massachusetts for the young: being also in some part the history of other towns and cities in the county of Hampden''. The Connecticut Valley Historical Society. pp. 46–48</ref> During its early existence, Springfield flourished as both an agricultural settlement and trading post, although its prosperity waned dramatically during (and after) [[King Philip's War]] in 1675, when natives laid siege to it and burned it to the ground.  The original settlement&nbsp;– today's downtown Springfield&nbsp;– was located atop bluffs at the confluence of four rivers, at the nexus of trade routes to [[Boston]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York City]], and [[Montreal]], and with some of the northeastern United States' most fertile soil.<ref name="worldcat">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/org.oclc.lac.ui.DialABookServlet?oclcnum=61302153 |title=Find in a library       : The encyclopedia of New England |publisher=worldcat.org |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref> In 1777, Springfield's location at numerous crossroads led [[George Washington]] and [[Henry Knox]] to establish the United States' [[Springfield Armory|National Armory at Springfield]], which produced the first American musket in 1794, and later the famous [[Springfield rifle]].<ref name="springfield375.org">{{cite web |url=http://springfield375.org/?p=126 |title=Firsts &#124; Springfield 375 |publisher=Springfield375.org |date= |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}</ref> From 1777 until its closing during the [[Vietnam War]], the Springfield Armory attracted skilled laborers to Springfield, making it the United States' longtime center for precision manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springfieldmuseums.org/news/view/375-new_museum_of_springfield_history_to_open_october_10 |title=New Museum of Springfield History to Open October 10&nbsp;— News |publisher=Springfield Museums |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}</ref> The near-capture of the [[Springfield Armory|U.S. Arsenal at Springfield]] during [[Shays Rebellion]] of 1787 led directly to the formation of the [[U.S. Constitutional Convention]].

During early 21st century, Springfield sought to overcome its downgrade in reputation via long-term revitalization projects and undertook several large, but unfinished projects, including a $1&nbsp;billion high-speed rail ([[New Haven-Hartford-Springfield Commuter Rail Line|New Haven-Hartford-Springfield high-speed rail]];)<ref name="nhhsrail">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhhsrail.com |title=New Haven&nbsp;— Hartford&nbsp;– Springfield Rail Program |publisher=nhhsrail.com |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref> [[MGM Springfield|a proposed $1&nbsp;billion MGM Casino]];<ref name="mgmspringfield">{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/http://www.mgmspringfield.com/springfield/vision.aspx |title=MGM Springfield&nbsp;– Our Vision |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref> and various other construction and revitalization projects.<ref name="springfield-ma">{{cite web |url=http://www3.springfield-ma.gov/planning/328.0.html |title=Springfield Redevelopment Authority: Union Station |publisher=www3.springfield-ma.gov |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref>  ==Geography== [[File:Springfield ma from space.jpg|thumb|The [[Knowledge Corridor]] surrounding Springfield from space.]] Springfield is located at {{Coord|42|6|45|N|72|32|51|W|type:city}} (42.112411, −72.547455).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |date=February 12, 2011 |title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|33.2|sqmi|km2|0}}, of which {{convert|32.1|sqmi|km2|0}} is land and {{convert|1.1|sqmi|km2|1}} (3.31%) is water.

Aside from its rivers, Springfield's 2nd most prominent topographical feature is the city's {{convert|735|acre|ha|0}} [[Forest Park, Springfield, Massachusetts|Forest Park]], designed by renowned landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. Forest Park lies in the southwestern corner of the city, surrounded by Springfield's attractive garden districts, Forest Park and [[Forest Park Heights Historic District|Forest Park Heights]], which feature over 600 Victorian [[Painted ladies|Painted Lady]] mansions. Forest Park also borders Western Massachusetts' most affluent town, [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts]]. Springfield shares borders with other well-heeled suburbs such as [[East Longmeadow, Massachusetts|East Longmeadow]], [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]], [[Ludlow, Massachusetts|Ludlow]] and the de-industrializing city of [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]]. The small cities of [[Agawam, Massachusetts|Agawam]] and [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] lie less than a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from Springfield's Metro Center, across the Connecticut River.  The City of Springfield also owns the Springfield Country Club, which is located in the autonomous city of [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]], the latter of which separated from Springfield in 1774.<ref name="books.google.com"/>  ===Climate=== Springfield, like other cities in southern New England, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfa'') with four distinct seasons and precipitation evenly distributed throughout the year. Winters are cold with a daily average in January of around {{convert|26|°F|C|0}}. During winter, [[nor'easter]] storms can drop significant snowfalls on Springfield and the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Temperatures below {{convert|0|°F|°C|0}} can occur each year, though the area does not experience the high snowfall amounts and blustery wind averages of nearby cities such as [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] and [[Albany, New York]].  Springfield's summers are very warm and sometimes humid. During summer, several times per month, on hot days afternoon [[thunderstorms]] will develop when unstable warm air collides with approaching [[cold front]]s. The daily average in July is around {{convert|74|°F|C|0}}. Usually several days during the summer exceed {{convert|90|°F|°C|0}}, constituting a "[[heat wave]]." Spring and fall temperatures are usually pleasant, with mild days and crisp, cool nights. Precipitation averages {{convert|46.7|in|mm|0}} annually, and snowfall averages {{convert|49|in|cm|0}}, most of which falls from mid-December to early March. Although not unheard of, extreme weather events like [[hurricanes]] and [[tornado]]es occur infrequently in Springfield compared with other areas in the country. On the occasions that hurricanes have hit New England, Springfield's inland, upriver location has caused its damages to be considerably less than shoreline cities like [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

Volleyball was invented in the adjacent city of Holyoke, and the first exhibition match was held in 1896 at the [[Springfield College|International YMCA Training School]], now known as [[Springfield College]]. [[File:MassMutual Center December 2013.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The MassMutual Center in 2013]] [[Ice hockey]] has been played professionally in Springfield since the 1920s, and Springfield is home to the league headquarters of the [[American Hockey League]]. The [[Springfield Indians]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (now located in [[Utica, New York]]) was the oldest minor league hockey franchise in existence. In [[1994–95 AHL season|1994]] the team relocated to Worcester and was replaced by the current [[Springfield Falcons]], who play at the [[MassMutual Center]]. For parts of two seasons (1978–80) the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Hartford Whalers]] played in Springfield while their arena was undergoing repairs after a roof collapse. On the amateur level, the Junior A Springfield Olympics played for many years at the Olympia, while [[American International College]]'s Yellow Jackets compete in [[NCAA]] Division I hockey.

The team located closest are the Valley Blue Sox of the New England Collegiate Baseball League who play their games in nearby Holyoke, but house their team offices at 100 Congress Street in Springfield.  Springfield has an official roller derby team: [http://pairodicecityrollerderby.com/ Pair O Dice City Roller Derby]. They are a non-profit organization who uses their roller derby games as fundraisers for groups such as Dakin Animal Shelter and the Shriners. Pair O Dice skaters are featured on the Clean Up ads near the waterfront.  ==Architecture== {{See also|List of tallest buildings in Springfield, Massachusetts}} In addition to its nickname ''The City of Firsts'', Springfield is known as ''The City of Homes'' for its attractive architecture, which differentiates it from most medium-size, Northeastern American cities. Most of Springfield's housing stock consists of Victorian "[[Painted Ladies]]" (similar to those found in San Francisco;) however, Springfield also features [[Gilded Age]] mansions, urban condominiums buildings, brick apartment blocks, and more suburban post-World War II architecture (in the Sixteen Acres and Pine Point neighborhoods). While Springfield's architecture is attractive, much of its built-environment stems from the 19th and early 20th centuries when the city experienced a period of "intense and concentrated prosperity"&nbsp;– today, its Victorian architecture can be found in various states of rehabilitation and disrepair. As of 2011, Springfield's housing prices are considerably lower than nearby New England cities that do not feature such intricate architecture.  [[File:UnityChurch.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Unity Church (built 1866–1869), the first commission of noted architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson|H.H.

For example, Springfield's ornate Classical High School (235 State Street), with its immense Victorian atrium&nbsp;– where Dr. Seuss, Timothy Leary, and Taj Mahal all went to high school&nbsp;– is now a luxury condominium building. The [[Hotel Kimball]], (140 Chestnut Street), which hosted several U.S. Presidents as guests and once featured the United States' first commercial radio station (WBZ), has been converted into The [[Kimball Towers Condominiums]].<ref name="hammondmuseumofradio.org">{{cite web |author=Paul Cassel VE3SY |url=http://www.hammondmuseumofradio.org/wbz-dhalper.html |title=WBZ and WBZA in the 20's and 30's |publisher=Hammondmuseumofradio.org}}</ref> The former McIntosh Shoe Company (158 Chestnut Street), one of Springfield's finest examples of the [[Chicago School of Architecture]], has been converted into industrial-style condominiums; and the red-brick, former Milton Bradley toy factory is now Stockbridge Court Apartments (45 Willow Street). In the Ridgewood Historic District, the 1950s-futurist Mulberry House (101 Mulberry Street), is now a condominium building that features some of the finest views of Springfield.  [[Forest Park, Springfield, Massachusetts|Forest Park (and Forest Park Heights)]], surrounding [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]'s beautiful {{convert|735|acre|ha|1}} [[Forest Park (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Forest Park]], is a New England Garden District that features over 600 [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Painted Ladies]]. The [[McKnight, Springfield, Massachusetts (and Mason Square)|McKnight National Historic District]], America's first planned residential neighborhood, (1881), features over 900 Victorian Painted Ladies, many of which have been rehabilitated by Springfield's growing [[LGBT]] community. The Old Hill, Upper Hill, and Bay neighborhoods also feature this type of architecture.  Maple High, which is architecturally (and geographically) distinct from, but often included with Springfield's economically depressed [[Six Corners]] neighborhood, was Springfield's first "Gold Coast." Many mansions from the early 19th century and later [[gilded age]] stand atop a bluff on Maple Street, overlooking the Connecticut River. The Ridgewood Historic district on Ridgewood and Mulberry Streets also feature historic mansions from the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Springfield&nbsp;– like many mid-size Northeastern cities, e.g., Hartford, [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and New Haven&nbsp;– from the 1950s–1970s, razed a significant number of historic commercial buildings in the name of [[urban renewal]]. In 1961, this included Unity Church, the first building designed by the young [[Henry Hobson Richardson]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochsner |first1=Jeffrey Karl |authorlink1=Jeffrey  Karl Ochsner |title=H.H.

The City managed the recoveries with great skill and has come out in great shape; even receiving a bond upgrade from Standard and Poor's Investment Services. In addition the City of Springfield has received the GFOA's Distinguished Budget Award for six consecutive years.  ===Judicial system=== Like every other municipality in Massachusetts, Springfield has no judicial branch itself. Rather, it uses the Springfield-based state courts, which include Springfield district court and Hampden County [[Massachusetts Superior Court|Superior Court]], both of which are based in Springfield. The [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Federal District Court]] also regularly hears cases in Springfield&nbsp;– now in an architecturally award-winning building on State Street, constructed in 2009.  ===Politics=== {{See also|List of mayors of Springfield, Massachusetts}} Springfield became a [[City (Massachusetts)|city]] on May 25, 1852, by decree of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts Legislature]], after a decade-long internal dispute that resulted in the partition of Chicopee from Springfield, and thus the loss of 2/5 of the city's population.  Springfield, like all municipalities in Massachusetts, enjoys limited [[home rule]]. The current [[charter|city charter]], in effect since 1959, uses a "strong mayor" government with most power concentrated in the [[mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts|mayor]], as in Boston and elsewhere. The mayor representing the city's executive branch presents the budget, appoints commissioners and department heads, and in general runs the city. The Mayor is former City Councilor [[Domenic Sarno]], elected November 6, 2007 by a margin of 52.54% to 47.18% against incumbent Charles Ryan. He took office in January 2008. In November 2009 and 2011, Sarno won reelection, albeit&nbsp;— in the latter case&nbsp;— with just 22% of eligible Springfield voters voting.<ref name="valleyadvocate">{{cite web |url=http://www.valleyadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=14394 |title=The Valley Advocate: News&nbsp;— Where Were They on Election Day? |publisher=valleyadvocate.com |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref>  The Springfield [[City council]], consisting of thirteen members, is the city's legislative branch. Elected every odd numbered year, eight of its members are elected to represent "wards," which are made of (sometimes incongruous) groupings of Springfield neighborhoods, e.g. Springfield's ethnic North End neighborhoods&nbsp;— Memorial Square and Brightwood&nbsp;— share a ward with Metro Center, Springfield's downtown. Five city council members are elected at-large. The City Council passes the city's budget, holds hearings, creates departments and commissions, and amends zoning laws.  The mayor's office and city council chambers are located in city hall&nbsp;– part of the [[Springfield Municipal Group|Municipal Group]] in Metro Center, Springfield. The Finance Control Board met there as well.  {| class="wikitable" ! colspan = 6 | Voter Registration and Party Enrollment as of October 15, 2008<ref>{{cite web |title=Registration and Party Enrollment Statistics as of October 15, 2008 |publisher=Massachusetts Elections Division |format=PDF |accessdate=May 8, 2010 |url=http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/st_county_town_enroll_breakdown_08.pdf}}</ref> |- ! colspan = 2 | Party !

There would still be some at-large seats under this format. The primary argument for this has been that City Councilors live in only four of the city's wards. An initiative to change the composition failed to pass the City Council twice. In 2007 Mayor Charles V. Ryan and City Councilor Jose Tosedo proposed a home-rule amendment that would expand the council to thirteen members adding four seats to the existing nine member at large system, but allocated between eight ward and five at large seats. This home-rule petition was adopted by the City Council 8–1, and was later passed by the State Senate and House and signed by the Governor. On election day, November 6, 2007, city residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of changing the City Council and School Committee. The ballot initiative that established a new council with five at-large seats and eight ward seats passed 3–1. On November 3, 2009, Springfield held first-in-a-generation ward elections.  The results of the 2009 election were as follows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/elections/2009-elections.html |title=City of Springfield, Mass.: 2009 Municipal Elections |publisher=Springfieldcityhall.com}}</ref>  ===Crime===  During the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, Springfield experienced a wave of violent crime that negatively impacted the city's reputation, both regionally and nationally. At one point in the first decade of the 21st century, Springfield ranked as high as 18th in the United States' annual "City Crime Rankings." Since approximately 2006, the City of Springfield has experienced a dramatic, (nearly 50%) drop-off in citywide crime.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} In 2010, Springfield ranked 35th in the United States' City Crime Rankings&nbsp;– its 2nd lowest ranking in recent years, (in 2009, it ranked 51st).

It operates 38 elementary schools, six high schools, six middle schools (6–8) and seven specialized schools. The main high schools in the city include the [http://hscommerce.org High School of Commerce], [[Springfield Central High School]], [[Roger L Putnam Vocational-Technical High School]], and the [[Springfield High School of Science and Technology]], better known as Sci-Tech. There are also two charter secondary schools in the City of Springfield: SABIS International, which ranks among the top 5% of high schools nationally in academic quality, and the Hampden Charter School of Science. The city's School Committee {{When|date=October 2009}} passed a new neighborhood school program to improve schools and reduce the growing busing costs associated with the current plan. The plan faces stiff opposition from parents and minority groups who claim that the schools are still unequal. The city is required under a 1970s court order to balance schools racially, which had necessitated busing. However, since then, the city and the school's population has shifted and many of the neighborhoods are more [[Racial integration|integrated]], calling into question the need for busing at all. Though the plan is likely to be challenged in court, the state [[Board of Education]] decided it did not have authority to review it, sidestepping the volatile issue while effectively condoning it.  ====Private schools==== The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts|Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield]] operated five Catholic elementary schools in the city, all of which were consolidated into a single entity, St. Michael's Academy, in the autumn of 2009.<ref>[http://www.masslive.com/metrowest/republican/index.ssf?/base/news-17/1232787365176350.xml&coll=1 Catholic grade schools remade], ''The Republican'', January 24, 2009</ref> The non-denominational [[Pioneer Valley Christian School]] is located in the suburban [[Sixteen Acres, Springfield, Massachusetts|Sixteen Acres]] neighborhood, educating K–12.

WWLP is the [[NBC]] affiliate for the area, in addition to subchannel affiliations with [[The CW]] and [[Ion Television]]. While WWLP is licensed to Springfield, they moved their studios to nearby Chicopee from their old studios atop [[Provin Mountain]]. WWLP is the oldest TV station to air regularly scheduled programming in the market, launching its schedule on March 17, 1953, on Channel 61. WWLP also operated WRLP (UHF 32), a UHF station licensed to [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]], whose transmitter was in [[Winchester, New Hampshire]] as well as W69AQ (UHF 69), a low power station that transmitted from the WWLP tower on Provin Mountain. WWLP remains the only full-power station in the market with an analog television signal on the air. * '''[[WGGB]], UHF 40 (Digital 40).''' WGGB is the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and primary [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], secondary [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate for the area. WGGB is owned and operated by [[Meredith Corporation|Meredith Broadcasting]] and its studios are on Liberty Street near the Chicopee line. WGGB (originally WHYN) signed on on April 1, 1953 on Channel 55. In 1958, WHYN switched to UHF 40. Guy Gannett Broadcasting bought the station in 1979 and changed its call sign to the current WGGB-TV effective at the start of the following year. In 2008, WGGB launched a secondary service called "Fox 6", named after its channel position on the local [[Comcast]] cable TV lineup. FOX6 also appears on WGGB's [[Digital Television|DTV]] sub-channel 40.2. WGGB's analog television signal signed off permanently in late November 2008, due to a transmitter failure.

WSHM-LD is Springfield's [[CBS]] affiliate operated by Hartford's [[WFSB]]. WSHM is owned and operated by Meredith Broadcasting and shares studios with WGGB on Liberty Street near the Chicopee line. WSHM-LD and WGGB broadcast local news under the branding "Western Mass News", and maintain a relationship with the ''[[Springfield Republican]]''. WSHM-LD was formerly W67DF, a translator of [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]], before being sold to Meredith. WSHM-LD is referred to as "CBS 3", denoting its cable channel assignment within the market and to encourage long-time viewers of WFSB to stay with WSHM-LD. * '''[[WGBY]], UHF 57 (Digital 58 until April 18, 2009, Digital 22 thereafter).''' WGBY is the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] affiliate for the area. WGBY's studios are in downtown Springfield, near Interstate 91 and the [[Conrail]] train lines. WGBY signed on in 1963. WGBY is owned by the Boston-based [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]. WGBY signed off their analog signal permanently in November 2008, to allow for the replacement of [[transmitting antenna|transmission antennas]].  ====Cable operators==== Springfield proper is serviced exclusively by [[Comcast]] cable.

SWSC provides retail water in Springfield and Ludlow; wholesale water to Agawam, East Longmeadow, and Longmeadow; partial or peak service to Southwick, Westfield, and West Springfield; and emergency service to Chicopee and Wilbraham.<ref name="water system" />  ===Transportation=== [[File:Memorial Bridge, Springfield MA.jpg|200px|thumb|The Memorial Bridge across the Connecticut to Springfield's Metro Center neighborhood]] [[File:Florida 148.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bradley International Airport, 12 miles south of Springfield.]]  ====Ground==== Springfield is called the ''Crossroads of New England'' because it is the major shipping nexus from New York City, Boston, [[Montreal]] and the [[Great Lakes]] (via [[Albany, New York]]). Much of the cargo heading from one of these places to another crosses through the City of Springfield. As a geographical trade center, Springfield has more advantages than just being equidistant to these other large trade centers&nbsp;– it sits beside the [[Connecticut River]], on some of the most fertile farmland in the Northeast, served by numerous rails and [[Interstate Highways]], including [[I-90 (MA)|I-90]] ([[Massachusetts Turnpike|Mass Pike]]) and [[I-91 (MA)|I-91]], which connect [[New Haven]], Hartford, Holyoke, [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], and [[Vermont]] to Springfield. One of the few spurs of I-91 in Massachusetts, [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|I-291]], runs through Springfield, and provides a secondary connection between I-90 and I-91. (There is an unnumbered connector in West Springfield).  ====Rail==== Springfield has an [[Amtrak]] [[Springfield Union Station (Massachusetts)|station]] served by trains on the ''[[Vermonter]]'' service. Currently, Amtrak operates out of a self-built platform following the 1973 close of Springfield's grand 1926 [[Springfield Union Station (Massachusetts)|Union Station]]. In 2011, Springfield's Union Station received a $70&nbsp;million renovation to become an "intermodal transportation facility," allowing [[Peter Pan Bus]], [[Greyhound Bus]], and the [[PVTA]] to occupy a modernist space next to the rebuilt, 1926 Union Station.<ref>[http://www.springfield-ma.gov/planning/union_station.0.html City of Springfield].</ref> The renovated Union Station serves as a nexus for Amtrak's re-tooled ''Vermonter'', which in 2014, began to follow the tracks of the more direct, former ''[[Montrealer (train)|Montrealer]]'' route. This allowed Springfield to become the hub of an intercity commuter line headed north, with two stops in Springfield, two stops in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]] one stop in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]] and one stop each in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts|South Deerfield]], [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]], and [[Brattleboro, Vermont]].<ref>[http://www.eot.state.ma.us/downloads/90_DayReport/kc_intro_ppt20100323.pdf ] {{wayback|url=http://www.eot.state.ma.us/downloads/90_DayReport/kc_intro_ppt20100323.pdf |date=20110928191546 }}</ref><ref>updated reference: http://www.gazettenet.com/2012/07/10/new-ties-mark-rail-work-start</ref>  In addition to Springfield's intercity commuter rail line headed north, Springfield may also benefit from a high-speed intercity commuter/freight rail from the south. The [[Hartford Line]] has received complete funding from Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and as of December 2015, is nearing complete funding from the Federal Government and the State of Connecticut. The trains on the route between [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Springfield will, it has been reported, reach speeds of {{convert|110|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The project is scheduled to begin service in January 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stacom |first1=Dan |title=Springfield-To-New Haven Commuter Rail Cost Increases, Service Begins In 2018 |url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-amtrak-hartford-line-1204-20151204-story.html |accessdate=December 5, 2015 |publisher=Hartford Courant |date=December 4, 2015}}</ref>  Springfield-area freight yards stand to profit tremendously from the city's increased rail traffic. There are no major freight yards in Springfield proper, but CSOR and CSX serve the West Springfield Yard across the Connecticut River.  ====Bus==== Local transit buses running into and out of the city use a facility owned and operated by [[Peter Pan Bus]] Lines, which is headquartered in Springfield at the corner of Main and Liberty Streets, next to the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arch that denotes entrance into [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] Springfield. As of 2011, Peter Pan's Bus Terminal is need of a major aesthetic overhaul&nbsp;– the opportunity for Peter Pan, Greyhound, and the PVTA to move across the street to Springfield's Unions Station intermodal facility should render the point moot.<ref name="springfieldcityhall6">{{cite web |url=http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/fileadmin/Planning_files/rfqs/Union_Station_In_the_News/UStation_PressRelease.pdf |date=April 4, 2011 |title=UNION STATION REGIONAL INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION CENTER ARCHITECT AND PROJECT MANAGER NAMED |author=Thomas Walsh |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref> Plans call for a bus station to be built on the plot adjacent to Union Station&nbsp;– the site of the former Hotel Charles&nbsp;– with a 23-bay bus terminal on lower levels and a 400-space public parking lot on upper levels.  Currently, the PVTA, headquartered at the dilapidated Peter Pan Terminal, provides services to the cities of Springfield, Chicopee, West Springfield, Westfield, and Holyoke. In September 2010, the City of Holyoke opened a new state-of-the-art bus station across the street from its centrally located Veterans Park. That bus station acts as the PVTA's main point of transfer between Hampden County in the south, and Hampshire county in the north.  ====Air==== * [[Bradley International Airport]], in [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]] is {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} south of Metro Center Springfield, and 12 miles north of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. It features over 100 daily departures to 30 destinations on nine airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bradleyairport.com/Flights/destinations.aspx |title=Destinations |publisher=Bradleyairport.com |date=April 5, 2010}}</ref>  Other airports serving the Springfield include: * [[Westover Metropolitan Airport]] is {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from downtown Springfield.
