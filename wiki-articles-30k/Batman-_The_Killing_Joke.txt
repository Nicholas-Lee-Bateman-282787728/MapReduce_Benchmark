    Batman: The Killing Joke is a 1988 one-shot graphic novel featuring the characters Batman and the Joker written by Alan Moore, illustrated by Brian Bolland, and published by DC Comics. Set in the fictional U.S. city of Gotham, Batman: The Killing Joke provides an origin story for the supervillain the Joker, loosely adapted from the 1951 story arc "The Man Behind the Red Hood!". Taking place over two timelines, The Killing Joke depicts the Joker attempting to drive Jim Gordon insane and Batman's desperate attempt to stop him. Created by Moore as his own take on Joker's source and psychology, the story became famous for its origin of the Joker as a tragic character; a family man and failed comedian who suffered "one bad day" that finally drove him insane. Moore stated that he attempted to show the similarities between the two characters. The story's effects on the mainstream Batman continuity also included the shooting and paralysis of Barbara Gordon (a.k.a. Batgirl), an event that laid the groundwork for her to develop the identity of Oracle. Many critics consider the graphic novel to be the definitive Joker story and one of the best Batman stories ever published. The comic won the Eisner Award for 'Best Graphic Album' in 1989 and appeared on The New York Times Best Seller List in May 2009. In 2006, The Killing Joke was reprinted as part of the trade paperback DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore. In 2008, DC Comics reprinted the story in a deluxe hardcover edition, which features new coloring by Bolland, with a more somber, realistic, and subdued palette than the original. Elements of The Killing Joke have inspired or been incorporated into other aspects of Batman media, such as films and video games. Artist Brian Bolland's version of the Joker stemmed in part from his having recently seen the film The Man Who Laughs.Bolland, "The 1980's - The Killing Joke" in The Art of Brian Bolland, pp.&nbsp;195–197 Giordano's invitation led directly to Bolland working with writer Alan Moore to create a plausible background story for the Joker. He recounted, "I thought about it in terms of who's my favorite writer at the moment, what hero I would really love to do, and which villain? I basically came up with Alan, Batman and the Joker."Salisbury, Mark, Artists on Comic Art (Titan Books, 2000) ISBN 1-84023-186-6, p. 19 Although the story takes pains to stress that it is merely one possible 'origin story,' it has been widely accepted and adopted into DC continuity, and a central mutilation of a long-running character had to be specially approved by editor Wein. Bolland said that he saw "Judge Death [as] almost a dry run for drawing the Joker." He also recounted that "by the time Alan had finished Watchmen he had fallen out with DC to a certain extent&nbsp;... [i]n the end, he only continued to do Killing Joke as a favour to me." The 48-page prestige format one-shot comic took a considerable amount of time to produce. Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time-consuming work; both creators' then-recently finished 12-issue maxiseries titles had seen delays.Will Brooker, Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon (Bloomsbury Academic September 18, 2001) pp. 268-272. ISBN 978-0826413437. He was aided by the laid back attitude taken by DC, who he says "seemed prepared to let me do it at my own pace." The original editor, Len Wein, left the company, and was replaced by Dennis O'Neil, a "very hands-off sort of guy," with whom Bolland only recalls having one conversation about the book. Bolland envisaged the flashback sequences in black and white, and instructed Watchmen-colorist John Higgins to use "muted November colors". He was upset when he saw the finished comic had "garish&nbsp;... hideous glowing purples and pinks&nbsp;... and my precious Eraserhead-esque flashback sequences swamped in orange." The 2008-published 20th anniversary edition of the book featured new colouring by Bolland, restoring his artistic intentions to the palette.  The man who will become the Joker is an unnamed engineer who quits his job at a chemical company to become a stand-up comedian, only to fail miserably. Desperate to support his pregnant wife Jeannie, he agrees to guide two criminals through the chemical plant he previously worked at so that they can rob the card company next door. During the planning, the police inform him that his wife has died in a household accident. Grief-stricken, the engineer tries to withdraw from the plan, but the criminals strong-arm him into keeping his commitment to them. At the plant, the criminals make him don a special mask to become the infamous Red Hood. Unknown to the engineer, the criminals plan to use this disguise to implicate any accomplice as the mastermind and to divert attention away from themselves. Once inside, they run into security personnel, and a shootout ensues. The criminals are gunned down and the engineer finds himself confronted by Batman, who is investigating the disturbance. Terrified, the engineer jumps into the chemical plant's waste pound lock to escape Batman and is swept through a pipe leading to the outside. Once outside, he discovers, to his horror, that the chemicals have permanently bleached his skin chalk-white, stained his lips ruby-red and dyed his hair bright green. This disfigurement, compounded with the man's misfortunes of that one day, drives him completely insane and marks the birth of the Joker.  In the present day, the Joker kidnaps Commissioner Gordon and imprisons him in a run-down amusement park and shoots and paralyzes his daughter Barbara (aka Batgirl). His henchmen then strip Gordon naked and cage him in the park's freak show. He chains Gordon to one of the park's rides and forces him to view giant pictures of his wounded daughter, naked, hoping to drive Gordon insane in order to prove that the most upstanding citizen can go mad after having "one bad day." Once Gordon has run the horrifying gauntlet, the Joker puts him on display in the freak show, ridiculing him as "the average man," a naïve weakling doomed to insanity. Batman's attempts to locate Commissioner Gordon are unsuccessful until the Joker sends him a clue that leads him to the amusement park. Batman arrives to save Gordon, and the Joker retreats into the funhouse. Though traumatized by the ordeal, Gordon retains his sanity and moral code, and he insists that Batman capture the Joker "by the book" in order to show him that adhering to the legal process works. Batman enters the funhouse and faces the Joker's traps, while the Joker tries to persuade his old foe that the world is "a black, awful joke" and thus not worth fighting for. He also states that it takes only "one bad day" to turn an ordinary man insane, and taunts Batman by correctly speculating if it was one bad day where he lost a loved one at the hands of a criminal and how that drove Batman into becoming a vigilante. Batman tracks down and subdues the Joker, tells him that Gordon survived everything he suffered at the Joker's hands, and suggests that the Joker is alone in his madness. Batman then attempts to reach out to the Joker and offers to help his old foe recover and put an end to their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is too late for that. He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke, and proceeds to tell the joke. Batman chuckles at the punch line, accompanying the Joker's maniacal cackling as the police arrive. Batman then reaches out to put a hand on the Joker's shoulder and the light disappears as the rain continues to fall.Johnson, Scott (August 17, 2013).

Comic Book Resources by delving into the relationship between the two. The story itself shows how the Joker and Batman came to terms with their respective tragic days, both eventually leading to their present lives and confrontation. Critic Geoff Klock further explained that "both Batman and the Joker are creations of a random and tragic "one bad day." Batman spends his life forging meaning from the random tragedy, whereas the Joker reflects the absurdity of "life, and all its random injustice."Geoff Klock, How to Read Superhero Comics and Why (New York: Continuum, 2002) 52-53. ISBN 0-8264-1419-2. The trials the Joker put Commissioner Gordon through were meant to serve as "proof that there is something buried deep within each lunatic, a nugget of insanity, that is simply waiting for the right moment to spring forth." Unlike the Joker, Gordon kept his wits and moral code. The story is also famous for changing how the Modern Age of Comics perceived Batman comics by bringing it back to its darker roots.Daniels, Les. Batman: The Complete History. Chronicle Books, 1999. pp. 163-164, ISBN 978-0-8118-2470-5 The comic book, however, delves deeper in order to present Batman's own psychology, how he was just as insane as the clown, and how he and the Joker perceived the world according to differing points of view, with the Joker's interpreted through a joke. The Joker serves as an unreliable narrator. He admits to his own uncertainty, as he has disparate memories of the single event ("Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another&nbsp;... If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"), accentuating the comic's depiction of "a world unraveling toward relentless urban violence and moral nihilism&nbsp;..."David Leverenz, "The Last Real Man in America: From Natty Bumppo to Batman," The "American Literary History" Reader, ed. Gordon Hutner (New York: Oxford UP, 1995) 276. ISBN 0-19-509504-9. Although a one-shot, The Killing Joke had an extraordinary impact on the DC Universe—most significantly, Barbara Gordon's paralysis.

[http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/brought-to-light1.html "The Alan Moore Interview: The Killing Joke and Brought to Light"]. Blather.net.</ref> In 2003, he elaborated:  <blockquote>''The Killing Joke'' is a story about Batman and the Joker; it isn't about anything that you're ever going to encounter in real life, because Batman and the Joker are not like any human beings that have ever lived. So there's no important human information being imparted ... Yeah, it was something that I thought was clumsy, misjudged and had no real human importance. It was just about a couple of licensed DC characters that didn't really relate to the real world in any way.<ref>George Khoury, ed., ''The Extraordinary Works of Alan Moore'' (Raleigh: TwoMorrows, 2003) 123.

[He] said, 'Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.'

Retrieved July 30, 2012.</ref>  In the introduction to the story as it appears in the ''DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore'' trade paperback, Brian Bolland disputes the widely held belief that the story started as a ''Batman'' annual story and ended up as a prestige-format book. Bolland recalls that the idea for a one-off ''Batman'' story focusing on the Joker—with Batman more of an incidental character—was his. Bolland says that in 1984, DC editor [[Dick Giordano]] told him he could do any project for DC he wanted, and Bolland requested to do a Batman/Joker prestige book with Moore as writer. Bolland has also expressed dissatisfaction with the final book, and regrets that its impending schedule for release meant he could not color the book himself (John Higgins was the colorist). Bolland says that "the end result wasn't quite what I'd hoped. I don't think it rates with some of the highlights of Alan's career."<ref>Brian Bolland, "On Batman: Brian Bolland Recalls ''The Killing Joke''," ''DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore'' (New York: DC Comics, 2006) 256.

''The Dark Age: Grim, Great and Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics'' (Raleigh: TwoMorrows, 2006) 33.</ref> Moore's rendition of the Joker's origin employs elements of the 1951 story "The Man Behind the Red Hood" (''[[Detective Comics]]'' #168), which established the concept of the Joker originally having been a thief known only as the [[Red Hood]]. The [[Tragedy|tragic]] and human elements of the character's story, coupled with his barbaric crimes as the Joker, portray the character as more of a three-dimensional human being. During an interview with ''Salon'', Moore explained that Joker's psychotic nature could have been caused by a "bad decision" in his life.<ref name="Will"/>  Much of the Joker's backstory from ''The Killing Joke'' is also referenced in 2004's "Pushback" (''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'' #50-55; reprinted with #66 as ''Batman: Hush Returns''), in which the events are observed and reported by the [[Riddler]], who recounts that the pregnant wife of the pre-accident Joker, who is called "Jack" prior to his accident, was [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and murdered by the criminals in order to force his compliance.<ref>''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #52</ref><ref>''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #53</ref>  ==="No Joke"=== In 2007, [[Geoff Johns]] wrote a companion story to ''The Killing Joke'' entitled "No Joke" that appeared in the series ''[[Booster Gold (comic book)|Booster Gold]].<ref>{{citation|author=Geoff Johns|title=Booster Gold #5|publisher=DC Comics|year=2008|page=|isbn=}}</ref>  In the story, [[Booster Gold]] is charged by [[Rip Hunter]] to go back in time and save Barbara from being shot by the Joker. Booster arrives at the carnival shortly after the Joker has rounded up the freaks, only to be attacked by them. He manages to escape (after the Joker torments him), but arrives too late to save Barbara. Catching the Joker in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara (after having struck down Commissioner Gordon), Booster attacks the Joker in a rage; the Joker nevertheless gains the upper hand, snapping several photos of Booster as well. Rip removes Booster moments before he is killed, but Booster demands to be sent back again. Booster fails several times until Rip reveals that the Joker is destined to paralyze her, as it would ensure that she would become Oracle.  The story also reveals that Batman kept the photos of Barbara and Booster, and had been waiting until Booster came of age before confronting him. Batman thanks Booster for trying to stop the Joker and offers him his friendship. Eventually, [[Dick Grayson]], who becomes his mentor's temporary successor as Batman, would also learn about this and offer his thanks as well.  ==="Ladies' Night"=== In 2010, writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and artist [[Cliff Chiang]] collaborated on a one-shot story called "Ladies' Night", which was published in the anthology series ''[[The Brave and the Bold]].'' The story is set shortly before ''The Killing Joke'', and deals with [[Zatanna]] and [[Wonder Woman]] struggling to come to terms with the impending attack on Barbara after Zatanna has a [[precognition|precognitive]] dream about it. Like "No Joke," the story heavily implies that the heroines cannot alter Barbara's fate, despite their desire to do so, instead giving her a final night on the town before she loses the use of her legs. The story also implies that Wonder Woman served as the inspiration for Barbara Gordon's eventual codename of Oracle.<ref>[[Straczynski, J. Michael]] (w), [[Chiang, Cliff]] (a). "Ladies' Night".

In the new continuity, [[Barbara Gordon]] recovered from the paralysis inflicted upon her by the Joker's bullet which lasted for four years. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Gail Simone]]|penciler=Ardian Syaf|inker=Vicente Cifuentes|title=Batgirl|issue=3|volume=4|publisher=DC Comics|date=February 2012|page=10}}</ref>  On March 13, 2015 DC Comics released 25 Joker-themed variant covers for its various monthly series for release that June, in celebration of the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to ''[[Batgirl]]'' #41 by artist [[Rafael Albuquerque]] that took its inspiration from ''The Killing Joke''. The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her. The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The [[hashtag]] #changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant.

[[Heath Ledger]], who played the Joker, stated in an interview that he was given a copy of ''The Killing Joke'' as reference for the role.<ref>{{cite news| author=Daniel Robert Epstein | title = Heath Ledger Talks Joker | publisher=[[Newsarama]] | date=2006-11-07 | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=90305 | accessdate=2006-11-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061119213701/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=90305| archivedate= 19 November 2006 | deadurl= no}}</ref>   *The story is referenced in a flashback scene in the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]], ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]''. In the movie, the antagonist [[Red Hood]] lured Batman to the chemical factory where the Joker's accident took place. Batman remembered the events like in the comic, where a fleeing Joker attempted to escape while trying to claim that he was set up but accidentally fell into the toxic waste and disfigured him. Red Hood called it Batman's greatest failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5601910/batman-under-the-red-hood-tosses-the-comics-baggage-to-reveal-the-dark-side-of-the-bat-legacy|title=Under the Red Hood cuts through Batman's baggage to reveal the dark side of his legacy|publisher=io9.com|author=Alasdair Wilkins}}</ref>  ===Television=== *''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' features a slight retelling of ''The Killing Joke'' in the series prologue.

Several references to the story are also made in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.gamepressure.com/batmanarkhamasylum/guide.asp?ID=8064|title=Walkthrough - Batman: Arkham Asylum Game Guide|publisher=Game Pressure|author=Halas, Jacek}}</ref> The Joker's makeshift throne made of mannequins at the end of the game is almost identical to the one in the graphic novel. During the game, it is revealed that the Joker had been using e-mail under the alias "Jack White," which Batman identifies as "one of Joker's oldest aliases." The Joker even personally makes a knowing reference to the story: "There were these two guys in a lunatic asylum&nbsp;... Oh hell, you've heard that one before, haven't you?" *In the 2011 video game ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', which is the sequel to ''Batman: Arkham Asylum'', when the Joker's interview tapes are found, he retells his origin from ''The Killing Joke''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/games/batman/12237/batman-arkham-city-lead-narrative-designer-paul-crocker-interview|title=Lead narrative designer Paul Crocker interview|publisher=Den of Geek|author=Leader, Michael}}</ref> In this version, he reveals that the two thugs worked for [[Carmine Falcone]]. He apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. [[Hugo Strange]] then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read twelve different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. He then paraphrases a line from the book: "I like to keep things interesting. A wise man once told me that if you have to have an origin story, you're better off making it multiple choice". *In 2013 video game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', a [[downloadable content]] ''Killing Joke'' pack includes three skins for the character from the story.

When Batman enters a carnival-esque room, Joker tells him he got a great deal on an out-of-service amusement park, "You should have seen the look on the real estate agent's face when we shook hands on the deal!" In a level featuring a psychiatric interview with [[Harley Quinn|Dr. Harleen Quinzel]], Joker is playable as the Red Hood, walking through the chemical plant that will end with him becoming the Joker. While promoting the game, [[Troy Baker]], who voices the Joker in the game, recites a monologue from the graphic novel.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/10/12/nycc-batman-arkham-origins-killing-joke-monologue?utm_campaign=ign+main+twitter&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social NYCC: Batman: Arkham Origins' Killing Joke Monologue - IGN Video]</ref> *In ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', while under the influence of Scarecrow's latest toxin, Batman hallucinates the Joker's shooting of Barbara Gordon after she is kidnapped by the mysterious [[Jason Todd|Arkham Knight]], a hallucination of Joker noting that he merely got lucky when he shot Barbara as he was ignorant of her true ties to Batman, and also claimed that he had actually been aiming for Barbara's head.  ==Reprints== ''The Killing Joke'' is included in the 2006 trade paperback collection ''[[DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/29/dc-universe-by-alan-moore-hardcover-review|title=DC Universe by Alan Moore Hardcover Review|author=Schedeen, Jesse|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=March 29, 2012}}</ref>  In March 2008, a deluxe hardcover version of the book was released, featuring recoloring of the book by Brian Bolland. The new colors featured [[black-and-white]] flashbacks, as opposed to Higgins' colors, along with one or two items per panel colored in pink or red, up until the helmet of the Red Hood is revealed.
