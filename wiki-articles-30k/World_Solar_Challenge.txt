     The World Solar Challenge or the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge due to the sponsorship of Bridgestone Corporation is a biennial solar-powered car race which covers  through the Australian Outback, from Darwin, Northern Territory to Adelaide, South Australia.WSC website The race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 28-year history spanning thirteen races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. The objective of this competition is to promote research on solar-powered cars. Teams from universities and enterprises participate. In 2015, 43 teams from 23 countries competed in the race.2015 team list Efficient balancing of power resources and power consumption is the key to success during the race. At any moment in time the optimal driving speed depends on the weather forecast and the remaining capacity of the batteries. The team members in the escort cars will continuously remotely retrieve data from the solar car about its condition and use these data as input for prior developed computer programs to work out the best driving strategy. It is equally important to charge the batteries as much as possible in periods of daylight when the car is not racing. To capture as much solar energy as possible, the solar panels are generally directed such that these are perpendicular to the incident sun rays. Sometimes the whole solar array is tilted for this purpose. The idea for the competition originates from Danish-born adventurer Hans Tholstrup. He was the first to circumnavigate the Australian continent in a  open boat. At a later stage in his life he became involved in various competitions with fuel saving cars and trucks. Already in the 1980s, he became aware of the necessity to explore sustainable energy as a replacement for the limited available fossil fuel. Sponsored by BP, he designed the world's first solar car, called The Quiet Achiever, and traversed the  between Sydney, New South Wales and Perth, Western Australia in 20&nbsp;days. That was the precursor of the World Solar Challenge. After the 4th race, he sold the rights to the state of South Australia and leadership of the race was assumed by Chris Selwood. The race was held every three years until 1999 when it was switched to every two years. The first edition of the World Solar Challenge was run in 1987 when the winning entry, GM's Sunraycer won with an average speed of .ifp lab site Ford Australia's "Sunchaser" came in second. The "Solar Resource", which came in 7th overall, was first in the Private Entry category.

The 2013 World Solar Challenge featured the introduction of the Cruiser Class, which comprised more 'practical' solar cars with 2–4 occupants. The inaugural winner was Solar Team Eindhoven's Stella from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands with an average speed of , while the second place team was the SunCruiser from Hochschule Bochum in Germany, who inspired the creation of the Cruiser Class by racing more practical solar cars in previous WSC races. The Australian team, the University of New South Wales solar racing team Sunswift was the fastest competitor to complete the race, but was awarded third place overall after points were awarded for 'practicality' and for carrying passengers.WSC 2013 Cruiser class results  In the challenger class, the Dutch team from Delft University of Technology took back the title with Nuna 7 and an average speed of , while defending champions Tokai University finished second after an exciting close race, which saw a 10–30 minute race distance, though they drained the battery in final stint due to bad weather and finished some 3 hours later; an opposite situation of the previous challenge in 2011.WSC 2013 Challenger class results The Adventure Class was won by Aurora's Aurora Evolution.WSC 2013 Adventure class results The 2015 World Solar Challenge was held on October 18–25 with the same classes as the 2013 race.

Adelaide, 2998&nbsp;km from Darwin. However, for the timings recorded at that point to count, competitors must reach the official finish line in the centre of the city under solar power alone. As the race is over public roads, the cars have to adhere to the normal traffic regulations; however, there is a special note in the official regulations remarking on the tendency of drivers to take advantage of a favourable road camber in order to capture the maximum amount of solar energy. After midday when the sun is in the west, it would be advantageous to drive on the right side of the highway, provided, of course, there is no traffic in opposite direction. A minimum of 2 and maximum 4 drivers have to be registered. If the weight of a driver (including clothes) is less than , ballast will be added to make up the difference. Driving time is between 8:00 and 17:00 (from 8&nbsp;a.m. to 5&nbsp;p.m.). In order to select a suitable place for the overnight stop (alongside the highway) it is possible to extend the driving period for a maximum of 10&nbsp;minutes, which extra driving time will be compensated by a starting time delay the next day. At various points along the route there are checkpoints where every car has to pause for 30&nbsp;minutes. Only limited maintenance tasks (no repairs) are allowed during these compulsory stops. The capacity of the batteries is limited to a mass for each chemistry (such as Lithium Ion) equivalent to approximately 5&nbsp;kWh maximum. At the start of the race, the batteries may be fully charged. Batteries may not be replaced during the competition, except in the situation of a breakdown. However, in that case a penalty time will apply. Except for the maximum outer dimensions, there are no further restrictions on the design and construction of the car. The deceleration of the dual braking system must be at least 3.8&nbsp;m/s² (149.6 in/s²). By 2005, several teams were handicapped by the South Australian speed limit of , as well as the difficulties of support crews keeping up with  race vehicles. It was generally agreed that the challenge of building a solar vehicle capable of crossing Australia at vehicular speeds had been met and exceeded. A new challenge was set: to build a new generation of solar car, which, with little modification, could be the basis for a practical proposition for sustainable transport. Entrants to the 2007 race chose between racing in the Adventure and Challenge classes. Challenge class cars were restricted to 6&nbsp;square meters of Si solar collectors (a 25% reduction), and later to 3&nbsp;square meters for GaAs, driver access and egress were required to be unaided, seating position upright, steering controlled with a steering wheel, and many new safety requirements were added. Competitors also had to adhere to the new  speed limit across the Northern Territory portion of the Stuart Highway. The 2007 event again featured a range of supplementary classes, including the Greenfleet class, which features a range of non-solar energy-efficient vehicles exhibiting their fuel efficiency. For the 2009 challenge class several new rules were adopted, including the use of profiled tyres. Battery weight limits depend on secondary cell chemistries so that competitors have similar energy storage capabilities. Battery mass is now 20&nbsp;kg for Li-ion and Li-polymer battery (was reduced from 25 and 21&nbsp;kg in the past). In 2013, a new Cruiser Class was introduced. The race took place in four stages. Final placings were based on a combination of time taken (56.6%), number of passengers carried (5.7%), battery energy from the grid between stages (18.9%), and a subjective assessment of practicality (18.9%) In the 2015 Cruiser Class regulations, the scoring formula emphasized practicality less than before. Elapsed time will account for 70% of the score, passengers 5%, grid energy use 15%, and practicality 10%.
