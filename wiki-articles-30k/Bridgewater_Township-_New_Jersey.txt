Bridgewater Township was originally created by Royal charter on April 4, 1749, from portions of the Northern precinct. It was incorporated as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships by the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, under the Township Act of 1798. During the nineteenth century, portions of the township were taken to form Warren Township (March 5, 1806), Branchburg Township (April 5, 1845), Somerville (March 25, 1863), Raritan (April 3, 1868) and Bound Brook (March 24, 1869).Snyder, John P.

Bridgewater is a relatively large, suburban township located in the center of Somerset County. The area of the present Township of Bridgewater was originally purchased from a local Lenape Native American tribe. Bridgewater was chartered by George II of Great Britain in 1749, and incorporated on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey's 104 original townships. It is named after the town of Bridgwater in the English county of Somerset.Hutchinson, Viola L. The Origin of New Jersey Place Names, New Jersey Public Library Commission, May 1945.

Tradition holds that it was at the Middlebrook encampment that the first official flag of the United States was unfurled, after a law to adopt a national flag had been passed by Congress on June 14, 1777. By special order of Congress, a Thirteen Star Flag is flown 24 hours a day at the Washington Camp Ground, part of the former Middlebrook encampment, in Bridgewater. Since 1889, the first hoisting of the flag is commemorated annually each July 4 with a changing of the flag, a reading of the Declaration of Independence, and the delivery of an historical address.Staff. "PATRIOTIC READING AGAIN SAVES SITE", The New York Times, July 4, 1970. "MIDDLEBROOK HEIGHTS, N.&nbsp;J., July 3 (UPI) A reading of the Declaration of Independence tomorrow will preserve for another year the historic campsite here where George Washington is believed to have first flown the 13-star flag officially before his troops." Until the 1960s, Bridgewater was largely known as a farming community. In the 1970s its population began to grow when residents of larger cities such as Plainfield and Newark started to migrate into Bridgewater as a result of the 1967 Plainfield Riots and 1967 Newark riots. Subsequently, Bridgewater started to receive an influx of residents who worked in the strong pharmaceutical, telecommunications and financial industries in Bridgewater and the Raritan Valley. More recently, there has also been growth as Bridgewater has become more popular with New York City commuters who use Bridgewater Station on New Jersey Transit's Raritan Valley Line or Interstate 78 East to commute to New York City. Bridgewater is now a fairly developed suburban community, with only a few traces of its rural past still evident in the town (particularly in its northwestern section). Bridgewater is now Somerset County's second-most populous municipality, after Franklin Township. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 32.510 square miles (84.200&nbsp;km2), including 32.037 square miles (82.974&nbsp;km2) of land and 0.473 square miles (1.226&nbsp;km2) of water (1.46%). While much of Bridgewater has relatively flat terrain, the northeastern portion of the township is very hilly, with the First Ridge of the Watchung Mountains (sometimes known as the First Watchung Mountain) passing through the township. Additionally the Second Ridge (Second Mountain) passes just north of the township border. The Raritan River and its branches and tributaries form much of Bridgewater's borders with other municipalities and a number of smaller rivers and streams run through Bridgewater. The Raritan itself runs along Bridgewater's southern border (except where Somerville and Raritan were carved out as separate boroughs) and the North Branch of the Raritan River forms the township's western border with Branchburg. The North Branch and South Branch of the Raritan River meet at the extreme southwestern corner of Bridgewater at the border with both Branchburg Township and Hillsborough Township, and this point known as the Raritan River Confluence was once intended to be a major reservoir.

In early 2011, application was made to turn the former inn/reception center, the Redwood Inn, into a mosque, the town's first.Levine, Audrey. "Application for Mosque on Planning Board Agenda", Bridgewater Patch. January 21, 2011. Accessed February 15, 2012. The township council passed an ordinance that required houses of worship, country clubs and other such businesses only be built on locations with access to major roads, which would directly impact the application by the mosque.Levine, Audrey. "Hearing Postponed for Zoning Change Ordinance on Houses of Worship; Public hearing postponed until March 14.", Bridgewater Patch, March 3, 2011. Accessed February 1, 2015. "The ordinance, which was unanimously recommended by the planning board Monday, changes township zoning to state that houses of worship, country clubs and other businesses can only be built on locations with access to major thoroughfares." The planning board then immediately dismissed the application, averting state statute that would become effective on May 5 that would have made rejection much more difficult. The applicant, Al Falah Center, then filed a lawsuit against the township.Levine, Audrwy. "Al Falah Center Files Suit Against Bridgewater; The center claims the township's new zoning ordinance violates religious freedom.", Bridgewater Patch, April 27, 2011. Accessed February 1, 2015. "The Al Falah Center filed a suit against Bridgewater Tuesday, alleging that the township's new zoning ordinance that requires houses of worship to be on major roads prevents members of the Muslim community from exercising their freedom of religion." In December 2014, the case was settled out of court, with the township agreeing to purchase a  lot between Routes 202-206 and Route 287 for $2.75 million and give it to the organization to build a mosque, as well as provide $5 million paid by its insurer for reimbursement for legal fees and alleged damages. In return, the case was dropped and the township was given ownership of the original Mountaintop Road property, with the zoning ordinance law left intact.Hochman, Louis C. "Bridgewater mosque will be built, as township settles suit for $7.75 million", NJ Advance Media for NJ.com, December 2, 2014. Accessed January 8, 2015. "The Al Falah Center has agreed not to build a mosque on Mountaintop Road — and will instead build one on a $2.75 million 15-acre lot the township will buy for it under the terms of a settlement, MyCentralJersey.com reports."
