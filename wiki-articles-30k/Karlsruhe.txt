    Karlsruhe (; formerly Carlsruhe) is the second-largest city in the state of Baden-Württemberg, in southwest Germany, near the Franco-German border. It has a population of 296,033. Karlsruhe Palace was built in 1715, and the city is now the seat of the two highest courts in Germany: the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Court of Justice.  The city lies at an altitude between 100&nbsp;m (on the eastern shore of the river Rhine) and 322&nbsp;m (near the communications tower In the suburb of Wettersbach). Its geographical coordinates are ; the 49th parallel runs through the city centre. Its course is marked by a stone and painted line in the Stadtgarten (municipal park). The city was planned with the palace tower (Schloss) at the center and 32&nbsp;streets radiating out from it like the spokes of a wheel, or the ribs of a folding fan, so that one nickname for Karlsruhe in German is the "fan city" (Fächerstadt). Almost all of these streets survived until today. Because of this city layout, in metric geometry, Karlsruhe metric refers to a measure of distance that assumes travel is only possible along radial streets and along circular avenues around the centre. The city centre is the oldest part of town and lies south of the palace in the quadrant defined by nine of the radial streets. The central part of the palace runs east-west, with two wings, each at a 45°&nbsp;angle, directed southeast and southwest (i.e.,&nbsp;parallel with the streets marking the boundaries of the quadrant defining the city center). The market square lies on the street running south from the palace to Ettlingen. The market square has the town hall (Rathaus) to the west, the main Lutheran church (Evangelische Stadtkirche) to the east, and the tomb of Margrave Charles III William in a pyramid in the buildings, resulting in Karlsruhe being one of only three large cities in Germany where buildings are laid out in the neoclassical style. The area north of the palace is a park and forest. Originally the area to the east of the palace consisted of gardens and forests, some of which remain, but the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (founded in 1825), Wildparkstadion football stadium, and residential areas have been built there. The area west of the palace is now mostly residential. Karlsruhe experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb) similar to much of Germany. In comparison, Karlsruhe features hot summers and average to mild winters. The city is one of the warmest and sunniest in Germany. Precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year. In 2008, the weather station in Karlsruhe, which had been operating since 1876, was closed; it was replaced by a weather station in Rheinstetten, south of Karlsruhe. According to legend, the name Karlsruhe, which translates as "Charles’ repose", was given to the new city after a hunting trip when Margrave Charles III William of Baden-Durlach, woke from a dream in which he dreamt of founding his new city. A variation of this story claims that he built the new palace in order to find peace from his wife. Charles William founded the city on June 17, 1715, after a dispute with the citizens of his previous capital, Durlach. The founding of the city is closely linked to the construction of the palace. Karlsruhe became the capital of Baden-Durlach and in 1771 of the united Baden until 1945. Built in 1822, the Ständehaus was the first parliament building in a German State. In the aftermath of the democratic revolution of 1848, a republican government was elected here. Karlsruhe was visited by Thomas Jefferson during his time as the American envoy to France; when Pierre Charles L'Enfant was planning the layout of Washington, D.C., Jefferson passed to him maps of 12 European towns to consult, one of which was a sketch he had made of Karlsruhe during his visit. In 1860, the first-ever international professional convention, the Karlsruhe Congress of chemists, was held in the city. Much of the central area, including the palace, was reduced to rubble by Allied bombing during World War II but was rebuilt after the war. Located in the American zone of the post-war Allied occupation, Karlsruhe was home to an American military base, established in 1945. In 1995, the bases closed, and their facilities were turned over to the city of Karlsruhe. The following list shows the most significant groups of immigrants residing in the city of Karlsruhe by country. The Stadtgarten is a recreational area near the main railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and was rebuilt for the 1967 Federal Garden Show (Bundesgartenschau). It is also the site of the Karlsruhe Zoo. The Durlacher Turmberg has a look-out tower (hence its name). It is a former keep dating back to the 13th century. The city has two botanical gardens: the municipal Botanischer Garten Karlsruhe, which forms part of the Palace complex, and the Botanischer Garten der Universität Karlsruhe, which is maintained by the university. The Marktplatz has a stone pyramid marking the grave of the city's founder. Built in 1825, it is the emblem of Karlsruhe. The city is nicknamed the "fan city" (die Fächerstadt) because of its design layout, with straight streets radiating fan-like from the Palace. The Karlsruhe Palace (Schloss) is an interesting piece of architecture; the adjacent Schlossgarten includes the Botanical Garden with a palm, cactus and orchid house, and walking paths through the woods to the north. The so-called Kleine Kirche (Little Church), built between 1773 and 1776, is the oldest church of Karlsruhe's city centre. The architect Friedrich Weinbrenner designed many of the city's most important sights. Another sight is the Rondellplatz with its 'Constitution Building Columns' (1826). It is dedicated to Baden's first constitution in 1818, which was one of the most liberal of its time. The Münze (mint), erected in 1826/27, was also built by Weinbrenner.  The St. Stephan parish church is one of the masterpieces of neoclassical church architecture in.Southern Germany Weinbrenner, who built this church between 1808 and 1814, orientated it to the Pantheon, Rome.  The neo-Gothic Grand Ducal Burial Chapel, built between 1889 and 1896, is a mausoleum rather than a church, and is located in the middle of the forest. The main cemetery of Karlsruhe is the oldest park-like cemetery in Germany. The crematorium was the first to be built in the style of a church. Karlsruhe is also home to a Museum of Natural History, an opera house (the Baden State Theatre), as well as a number of independent theatres and art galleries. The State Art Gallery, built in 1846 by Heinrich Hübsch, displays paintings and sculptures from six centuries, particularly from France, Germany and Holland. Karlsruhe's newly renovated art museum is one of the most important art museums in Baden-Württemberg. Further cultural attractions are scattered throughout Karlsruhe's various incorporated suburbs. Established in 1924, the Scheffel Association is the largest literary society in Germany. Today the Prinz-Max-Palais, built between 1881 and 1884 in neoclassical style, houses the organisation and includes its museum.  Due to population growth in the late 19th century, Karlsruhe developed several suburban areas (Vorstadt) in the Gründerzeit and especially art nouveau styles of architecture, with many preserved examples. Karlsruhe is also home to the Majolika-Manufaktur, the only art-ceramics pottery studio in Germany. Founded in 1901, it is located in the Schlossgarten. A 'blue streak' (Blauer Strahl) consisting of 1,645 ceramic tiles, connects the studio with the Palace. It is the world's largest ceramic artwork. Another tourist attraction is the Centre for Art and Media (Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie, or ZKM), which is located in a converted ammunition factory.  Karlsruhe is the seat of the German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) and the highest Court of Appeals in civil and criminal cases, the Bundesgerichtshof. The courts came to Karlsruhe after World War II, when the provinces of Baden and Württemberg were merged. Stuttgart, capital of Württemberg, became the capital of the new province (Württemberg-Baden in 1945 and Baden-Württemberg in 1952). In compensation for the state authorities relocated to Stuttgart, Karlsruhe applied to become the seat of the high court.Stadt Karlsruhe Stadtarchiv (ed.): Karlsruhe. Die Stadtgeschichte. Badenia, Karlsruhe 1998, ISBN 3-7617-0353-8, p. 591–594 There are four hospitals: The municipal Klinikum Karlsruhe provides the maximum level of medical services, the St. Vincentius-Kliniken and the Diakonissen krankenhaus'', connected to the Catholic and Protestant churches, respectively, offer central services, and the private ''Paracelsus-Klinik'' basic medical care, according to state hospital demand planning.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}  ==Economy== Germany's largest [[oil refinery]] is located in Karlsruhe, at the western edge of the city, directly on the river [[Rhine]]. The ''Technologieregion Karlsruhe'' is a loose confederation of the region's cities in order to promote high tech industries; today, about 20% of the region's jobs are in research and development.

Two major [[internet service provider]]s, [[WEB.DE]] and [[schlund+partner]]/[[1&1 Internet|1&1]], now both owned by [[United Internet]]&nbsp;AG, are located at Karlsruhe.  The library of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] developed the [[Karlsruher Virtueller Katalog]], the first internet site that allowed researchers worldwide (for free) to search multiple library catalogues worldwide.  In the year 2000 the regional online "newspaper" ''ka&#8209;news.de'' was created. As a daily newspaper, it not only provides the news, but also informs readers about upcoming events in Karlsruhe and surrounding areas. [[File:Karlsruhe Rbf Einfahrgruppe.jpg|thumb|[[Rail yard]], [[bypass (road)|bypass road]] Südtangente]]  In addition to established companies, Karlsruhe has a vivid and spreading startup community with well-known startups like STAPPZ.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techtag.de/startups/10-fragen-christian-von-stappz/ | title=Interview mit einem Gründer aus Karlsruhe | accessdate=2015-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://stappz.com | title=STAPPZ App from Karlsruhe, Homepage | accessdate=2015-05-08}}</ref> Together, the local high tech industry is responsible for over 22.000 jobs.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.clusterportal-bw.de/clusterdatenbank/clusterdb/Clusterinitiative/show/clusterinitiative/cyberforum-e-v/ | title=Region: Mittlerer Oberrhein Informationstechnologie, IT-Anwendungen / Unternehmenssoftware | accessdate=2015-05-08}}</ref>  ==Transport== The [[Verkehrsbetriebe Karlsruhe]] (VBK) operates the city's urban public transport network, comprising seven tram routes and a network of bus routes. This network is well developed and all city areas can be reached round the clock by tram and a night bus system. The [[Turmbergbahn]] [[funicular|funicular railway]], to the east of the city centre, is also operated by the VBK.  The VBK is also a partner, with the [[Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft]] and [[Deutsche Bahn]], in the operation of the [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]], the rail system that serves a larger area around the city. This system makes it possible to reach other towns in the region, like [[Ettlingen]], [[Wörth am Rhein]], [[Pforzheim]], [[Bad Wildbad]], [[Bretten]], [[Bruchsal]], [[Heilbronn]], [[Baden-Baden]], and even [[Freudenstadt]] in the [[Black Forest]] right from the city centre. The Stadtbahn is well known in transport circles around the world for pioneering the concept of operating trams on train tracks, to achieve a more effective and attractive [[public transport]] system, to the extent that this is often known as the [[Karlsruhe model]] [[tram-train]] system.  Karlsruhe is well-connected via road and rail, with [[Autobahn]] and [[InterCityExpress]] connections going to [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]]/[[Munich]] and [[Freiburg]]/[[Basel]] from [[Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof]]. Since June 2007 it has been connected to the [[TGV]] network, reducing travel time to [[Paris]] to only three hours (previously it had taken five hours).  [[File:Karlsruhe OElhafen.jpg|thumb|Oil port]] Two ports on the [[Rhine]] provide transport capacity on [[cargo ship]]s, especially for [[petroleum products]].  The nearest airport is part of the [[Baden Airpark]] (officially ''Flughafen Karlsruhe/[[Baden-Baden]]'') about {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Karlsruhe, with regular connections to airports in Germany and Europe in general. [[Frankfurt International Airport]] can be reached in about an hour and a half by car (one hour by [[InterCityExpress]]); [[Stuttgart Airport]] can be reached in about one hour (about an hour and a half by train and [[S-Bahn|S&#8209;Bahn]]).  Two interesting facts in transportation history are that both [[Karl Drais]], the inventor of the bicycle, as well as [[Karl Benz]], the inventor of the automobile were born in Karlsruhe. Benz was born in Mühlburg, which later became a borough of Karlsruhe (in 1886). Benz also studied at the Karlsruhe University. It also is interesting that Benz’s wife [[Bertha Benz|Bertha]] took the world's first long distance-drive with an automobile from [[Mannheim]] to Karlsruhe-Grötzingen and [[Pforzheim]] (see [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]]). Their professional lives led both men to the neighboring city of Mannheim, where they first applied their most famous inventions.  [[File:Karlsruhe Leibgrenadierdenkmal.jpg|thumb|Memorial for Baden Life Grenadiers in several wars, 1803–1918]] [[File:Karlsruhe Durlach Karlsburg.jpg|thumb|[[Karlsburg Castle]] in Durlach]]  ==Jewish community== [[File:Juedischer Friedhof Groetzingen.jpg|thumb|Jewish cemetery of Grötzingen]] Jews settled in Karlsruhe since its foundation. They were attracted by the numerous privileges granted by its founder to settlers, without discrimination as to creed. Official documents attest the presence of several Jewish families at Karlsruhe in 1717. A year later the city council addressed to the margrave a report in which a question was raised as to the proportion of municipal charges to be borne by the newly arrived Jews, who in that year formed an organized congregation, with Rabbi Nathan Uri Kohen of [[Metz]] at its head. A document dated 1726 gives the names of twenty-four Jews who had taken part in an election of municipal officers.  As the city grew, permission to settle there became less easily obtained by Jews, and the community developed more slowly. A 1752 Jewry ordinance stated Jews were forbidden to leave the city on Sundays and Christian holidays, or to go out of their houses during church services, but they were exempted from service by court summonses on Sabbaths. They could sell wine only in inns owned by Jews and graze their cattle, not on the [[commons]], but on the wayside only. Karlsruhe was the seat of the central council of Baden Jewry. The first chief rabbi of the country Rabbi Asher Loew was from (Durlach) Karlsruhe, [[Nethaneel Weil|Nethanael Weill]] was a rabbi in Karlsruhe from 1750 until his death.  [[File:Karlsruhe Synagoge 1810.jpg|thumb|[[Karlsruhe Synagogue]], built by [[Friedrich Weinbrenner]] in 1798, existed until 1871]] In 1783, by a decree issued by Margrave [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Charles Frederick of Baden]], the Jews ceased to be [[serf]]s, and consequently could settle wherever they pleased. The same decree freed them from the ''Todfall'' tax, paid to the clergy for each Jewish burial. In commemoration of these changes special prayers were prepared by the acting rabbi Jedidiah Tiah Weill, who, succeeding his father in 1770, held the office until 1805. In 1808 the government issued regulations concerning the administration of the spiritual affairs of the Jewish community, by which the chief rabbi of Karlsruhe became the spiritual head of the Jews of the country. Complete [[emancipation]] was given in 1862, Jews were elected to city council and Baden parliament, and from 1890 were appointed judges. Jews were persecuted in riots occurring in 1819 and anti-Jewish demonstrations were held in 1843, 1848, and the 1880s. The well-known German-Israeli artist [[Leo Kahn]] studied in Karlsruhe before leaving for France and Israel in the 1920s and 1930s. [[File:Chanukka Karlsruhe 3.jpg|thumb|Public [[hanukkah]] on the ''Schlossplatz'']] Today, there are about 900 members in the Jewish community, many of whom are recent immigrants from Russia, and an orthodox rabbi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jg-karlsruhe.de |title=Jewish Community Karlsruhe - Karlsruhe, Germany }}</ref>  Karlsruhe has memorialized its Jewish community and notable pre-war synagogues with a memorial park.<ref name="alemannia-judaica">{{cite web|url=http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/images/Images%2021/ka%20syn.jpg|title=images/Images%2021/ka%20syn|publisher=alemannia-judaica.de|accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref>  ===Karlsruhe and the Holocaust=== [[File:Karlsruhe Synagoge Luftbild.jpg|thumb|The new synagogue]] In 1933, 3,358 Jews lived in Karlsruhe. The community owned buildings and property, such as two synagogues, one on Karl-Friedrich-Straße and one on Kronenstraße, two elderly citizens' homes, a Jewish school, a hospital, welfare institutions, and several Jewish cemeteries. During the first years of the Nazi regime, the community continued to function, particularly to prepare Jews for emigration. On October 28, 1938, all male Polish Jews living in Karlsruhe were deported to Poland. Synagogues were destroyed on [[Kristallnacht]], 9–10 November 1938. Most of the men were arrested and sent to [[Dachau concentration camp]], but were released after they had furnished proof that they intended to emigrate. In October 1940, 895 Jews were expelled during [[Operation Wagner-Bürckel]] and interned by the French [[Vichy France|Vichy]] authorities in [[Camp Gurs|Gurs]] in southern France. Most of these were then deported from there to [[Auschwitz]] (via the [[Drancy deportation camp]], on the outskirts of [[Paris]]) between August and November 1942. Most of the 429 remaining Jews and other so‑called "non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]]" were deported to the east between 1941 and 1944. In 1945 there were only 18 Jews in Karlsruhe. More than 1,000 of them had been killed between 1933 and 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karlsruhe.de/kultur/stadtgeschichte/gedenkbuch.de |title=Karlsruhe condolence book |publisher=Karlsruhe.de |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}</ref> The Baden Central Jewish Council was reorganized in 1948.
