  The DNA polymerases are enzymes that create DNA molecules by assembling nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. These enzymes are essential to DNA replication and usually work in pairs to create two identical DNA strands from a single original DNA molecule. During this process, DNA polymerase “reads” the existing DNA strands to create two new strands that match the existing ones. Every time a cell divides, DNA polymerase is required to help duplicate the cell’s DNA, so that a copy of the original DNA molecule can be passed to each of the daughter cells. In this way, genetic information is transmitted from generation to generation. Before replication can take place, an enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA molecule from its tightly woven form. This opens up or “unzips” the double-stranded DNA to give two single strands of DNA that can be used as templates for replication. In 1956, Arthur Kornberg and colleagues discovered the enzyme DNA polymerase I, also known as Pol I, in Escherichia coli. They described the DNA replication process by which DNA polymerase copies the base sequence of a template DNA strand. Subsequently, in 1959, Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work.  DNA polymerase II was also discovered by Kornberg and Malcolm E. Gefter in 1970 while further elucidating the role of Pol I in E. coli DNA replication.   The main function of DNA polymerase is to make DNA from nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. The DNA copies are created by the pairing of nucleotides to bases present on each strand of the original DNA molecule. This pairing always occurs in specific combinations, with cytosine along with guanine, and thymine along with adenine, forming two separate pairs, respectively. When creating DNA, DNA polymerase can add free nucleotides only to the 3' end of the newly forming strand. This results in elongation of the newly forming strand in a 5'-3' direction. No known DNA polymerase is able to begin a new chain (de novo); it can only add a nucleotide onto a pre-existing 3'-OH group, and therefore needs a primer at which it can add the first nucleotide. Primers consist of RNA or DNA bases (or both). In DNA replication, the first two bases are always RNA, and are synthesized by another enzyme called primase. Enzymes,helicase and topoisomerase II, are required to unwind DNA from a double-strand structure to a single-strand structure to facilitate replication of each strand consistent with the semiconservative model of DNA replication. It is important to note that the directionality of the newly forming strand (the daughter strand) is opposite to the direction in which DNA polymerase moves along the template strand. Since DNA polymerase requires a free 3' OH group for initiation of synthesis, it can synthesize in only one direction by extending the 3' end of the preexisting nucleotide chain. Hence, DNA polymerase moves along the template strand in a 3'-5' direction, and the daughter strand is formed in a 5'-3' direction.  This difference enables the resultant double-strand DNA formed to be composed of two DNA strands that are antiparallel to each other. The function of DNA polymerase is not quite perfect, with the enzyme making about one mistake for every billion base pairs copied. Error correction is a property of some, but not all, DNA polymerases. This process corrects mistakes in newly synthesized DNA. When an incorrect base pair is recognized, DNA polymerase moves backwards by one base pair of DNA. The 3'-5' exonuclease activity of the enzyme allows the incorrect base pair to be excised (this activity is known as proofreading). Following base excision, the polymerase can re-insert the correct base and replication can continue forwards. This preserves the integrity of the original DNA strand that is passed onto the daughter cells. The known DNA polymerases have highly conserved structure, which means that their overall catalytic subunits vary very little from species to species, independent of their domain structures. Conserved structures usually indicate important, irreplaceable functions of the cell, the maintenance of which provides evolutionary advantages. The shape can be described as resembling a right hand with thumb, finger, and palm domains. The palm domain appears to function in catalyzing the transfer of phosphoryl groups in the phosphoryl transfer reaction. DNA is bound to the palm when the enzyme is active. This reaction is believed to be catalyzed by a two-metal-ion mechanism. The finger domain functions to bind the [[Nucleotide triphosphates|nucleotide triphosphate]] with the template base.  The thumb domain plays a potential role in the processivity, translocation, and positioning of the DNA.<ref name="pmid10364165">{{cite journal | author = Steitz TA | title = DNA polymerases: structural diversity and common mechanisms | journal = J.

[[Processivity]] is a characteristic of enzymes that function on polymeric substrates. In the case of DNA polymerase, the degree of processivity refers to the average number of nucleotides added each time the enzyme binds a template. The average DNA polymerase requires about one second locating and binding a primer/template junction. Once it is bound, a nonprocessive DNA polymerase adds [[nucleotide]]<nowiki/>s at a rate of one nucleotide per second.<ref name="Losick_2008">{{cite book | author = Losick R, Watson JD, Baker TA, Bell S, Gann A, Levine MW | title = Molecular biology of the gene | publisher = Pearson/Benjamin Cummings | location = San Francisco | year = 2008 | pages = | isbn = 0-8053-9592-X  | edition = 6th }}</ref>{{rp|207–208}} Processive DNA polymerases, however, add multiple nucleotides per second, drastically increasing the rate of DNA synthesis.

During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37&nbsp;°C, the rate was 749 nucleotides per second.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McCarthy D, Minner C, Bernstein H, Bernstein C |title=DNA elongation rates and growing point distributions of wild-type phage T4 and a DNA-delay amber mutant |journal=J.

There is a dramatic increase in processivity at the [[DNA replication#Replication fork|replication fork]]. This increase is facilitated by the DNA polymerase’s association with proteins known as the sliding [[DNA clamp]]. The clamps are multiple protein subunits associated in the shape of a ring. Using the [[hydrolysis]] of ATP, a class of proteins known as the [[Replication factor C|sliding clamp loading proteins]] open up the ring structure of the sliding DNA clamps allowing binding to and release from the DNA strand. [[Protein-protein interaction]] with the clamp prevents DNA polymerase from diffusing from the DNA template, thereby ensuring that the enzyme binds the same primer/template junction and continues replication.<ref name="Losick_2008"/>{{rp|207–208}} DNA polymerase changes conformation, increasing affinity to the clamp when associated with it and decreasing affinity when it completes the replication of a stretch of DNA to allow release from the clamp.  ==Variation across species==  {{Infobox protein family | Symbol = DNA_pol_A | Name = DNA polymerase family A | image = PDB 2hht EBI.jpg | width =  | caption = c:o6-methyl-guanine pair in the polymerase-2 basepair position | Pfam = PF00476 | Pfam_clan =   | InterPro = IPR001098 | SMART =  -| PROSITE = PDOC00412 | MEROPS =  | SCOP = 1dpi | TCDB =  | OPM family =  | OPM protein =  | CAZy =  | CDD =  }} {{Infobox protein family | Symbol = DNA_pol_B | Name = DNA polymerase family B | image = PDB 2dy4 EBI.jpg | width =  | caption = crystal structure of rb69 gp43 in complex with dna containing thymine glycol | Pfam = PF00136 | Pfam_clan = CL0194  | InterPro = IPR006134 | SMART =  | PROSITE = PDOC00107 | MEROPS =  | SCOP = 1noy | TCDB =  | OPM family =  | OPM protein =  | CAZy =  | CDD =  }} {{Infobox protein family | Symbol = DNA_pol_B_2 | Name = DNA polymerase type B, organellar and viral | image = PDB 1xhz EBI.jpg | width =  | caption = phi29 dna polymerase, orthorhombic crystal form, ssdna complex | Pfam = PF03175 | Pfam_clan = CL0194  | InterPro = IPR004868 | SMART =  | PROSITE =  | MEROPS =  | SCOP =  | TCDB =  | OPM family =  | OPM protein =  | CAZy =  | CDD =  }} Based on sequence homology, DNA polymerases can be further subdivided into seven different families: A, B, C, D, X, Y, and RT.

It also has Deoxyribophosphodiesterase (dRPase) activity in the polymerase domain and can show [[ATPase]] activity in close proximity to ssDNA.<ref name="pmid22135286">{{cite journal | author = Hogg M, Sauer-Eriksson AE, Johansson E | title = Promiscuous DNA synthesis by human DNA polymerase θ | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 2611–22 |date=March 2012 | pmid = 22135286 | pmc = 3315306 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1102 }}</ref>  ====Reverse transcriptase==== Retroviruses encode an unusual DNA polymerase called [[reverse transcriptase]], which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp) that synthesizes DNA from a template of RNA. The reverse transcriptase family contain both DNA polymerase functionality and RNase H functionality, which degrades RNA base-paired to DNA.  Some retrovirus examples include [[Hepatitis B]] virus and [[HIV]].<ref name="Losick_2008"/>{{rp|}}  ==See also== *[[Molecular machine#Biological|Biological machines]] *[[DNA repair]] *[[DNA replication]] *[[DNA sequencing]] *[[Enzyme catalysis]] *[[Genetic recombination]] *[[Molecular cloning]] *[[Polymerase chain reaction]] *[[Protein dynamics#Global flexibility: multiple domains|Protein domain dynamics]]  *[[Reverse transcription]] *[[RNA polymerase]] *[[Taq DNA polymerase]]  == References == {{reflist|2}}  == Further reading == {{refbegin}} * {{cite journal | author = Burgers PM, Koonin EV, Bruford E, Blanco L, Burtis KC, Christman MF, Copeland WC, Friedberg EC, Hanaoka F, Hinkle DC, Lawrence CW, Nakanishi M, Ohmori H, Prakash L, Prakash S, Reynaud CA, Sugino A, Todo T, Wang Z, Weill JC, Woodgate R | title = Eukaryotic DNA polymerases: proposal for a revised nomenclature | journal = J.
