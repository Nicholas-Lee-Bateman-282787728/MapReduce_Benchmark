 The King George V-class battleships were the most modern British battleships used during World War II. Five ships of this class were commissioned:  (1940),  (1941),  (1941),  (1942) and  (1942). The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited all of the number, displacement, and armament of warships built following its ratification, and this was extended by the First London Naval Treaty but these treaties were due to expire in 1936. With increased tension between Britain, the United States, Japan, France and Italy, it was supposed by the designers of these battleships that the treaty might not be renewed and the ships of the King George V class were designed with this possibility in mind. All five ships would see combat during World War II, with King George V and Prince of Wales being involved in the action on 24 May to 27 May that resulted in the German battleship  being sunk. Following this on 25 October 1941, Prince of Wales was sent to Singapore arriving on 2 December and becoming the flagship of Force Z. On 10 December, Prince of Wales was attacked by Japanese bombers and sank with the loss of 327 of its men. In the aftermath of the sinking, King George V, Duke of York, Howe and Anson provided escort duty to convoys bound for Russia. On 1 May 1942, King George V collided with the destroyer HMS Punjabi, resulting in King George V being sent to Gladstone docks for repairs on 9 May, before returning to escort duty on 1 July 1942. On October 1942 Duke of York was sent to Gibraltar as the new flagship of Force H and supported the Allied landings in North Africa in November. Anson and Howe would also provide cover for multiple convoys bound for Russia from late 1942 until 1 March 1943, when Howe provided convoy cover for the last time. In May 1943 King George V and Howe were moved to Gibraltar in preparation for Operation Husky. The two ships bombarded Trapani naval base and Favignana on 11–12 July and also provided cover for Operation Avalanche on 7 September to 14 September. During this time Duke of York and Anson participated in Operation Gearbox, which was designed to draw attention away from Operation Husky. Duke of York was also heavily involved in the action that sank the German battleship  on 25 December 1943. This battle was also the last time that British and German capital ships fought each other during World War II. In late March 1945, King George V and Howe were sent to the Pacific as part of Task Force 57. On 4 May 1945, King George V and Howe led a forty-five-minute bombardment of Japanese air facilities in the Ryukyu Islands. King George V fired her guns in anger for the last time in a night bombardment of Hamamatsu on 29 July and 30 July 1945. Duke of York and Anson were also dispatched to the Pacific, but arrived too late to participate in hostilities. On 15 August Duke of York and Anson accepted the surrender of Japanese forces occupying Hong Kong and along with King George V  were present for the official Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay. Following the end of World War II, the ships were slowly phased out of service and by 1957 all of the ships had been sold off for scrap; a process that was completed by 1958. The King George V class was the result of a design process that began in 1928. Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, a "holiday" from building capital ships was in force through 1931. The battleships of the British Navy consisted of only those old battleships that had been kept after the end of World War I, plus the two new, but slow s. In 1928, the Royal Navy started considering the requirements for the warships that it expected to start building in 1931.Brown, p. 25 The First London Naval Treaty of 1930 extended the "shipbuilding holiday" through 1937. Planning began again in 1935, drawing on previous design work. The new class would be built up to the Treaty maximum displacement of 35,000&nbsp;tons. Alternatives with 16-inch, 15-inch and 14-inch main guns were considered and the 15-inch armament was chosen. Most designs were intended to steam at 27 knots with full power, and it was decided that the likely decisive range in a battle would be from 12,000 to 16,000 yards. Armour and torpedo protection formed a much greater portion of the design than that of the previous Royal Navy battleships.Brown, pp. 28–29 In October 1935, the decision was made to use 14-inch guns. At the time, the United Kingdom was negotiating for a continuation of the Naval Treaties with the other parties of the London Treaty. The British Government favoured a reduction in the maximum calibre of battleship gun to 14 inches and in early October, the government learned that the United States of America would support this position if the Japanese could also be persuaded to do so. Since the large naval guns needed to be ordered by the end of the year, the British Admiralty decided on 14-inch guns for the King George V class. The Second London Naval Treaty, a result of the Second London Naval Conference begun in December 1935, was signed in March 1936 by the United States, France and Britain and this set a main battery of 14-inch naval guns as the limit.Raven and Roberts, p. 275 The King George Vs were the first British battleships to alternate engine rooms and boilers in the machinery spaces, which reduced the likelihood of one hit causing the loss of all power.Brown, pp. 164–165 The machinery was arranged in four engine (turbine) rooms and four boiler rooms, with the 8 machinery compartments alternating in pairs of engine or boiler rooms. Each pair of boiler rooms formed a unit with a pair of engine rooms. Nominal full power was 110,000 shaft horsepower at 230 rpm with  steam at .Journal of Naval Engineering The machinery was designed to operate at an overload power of 125,000 shpDumas, Warship, The King George V Class, Part 1, P14 and Prince of Wales "...main machinery steamed at overload powers of 128,000 to 134,000 shaft horsepower with no difficulties..."Garzke & Dulin, p. 206 during the hunt for the Bismarck.

It is calculated by dividing fuel consumption in pounds per hour, into the shaft horse power produced by the turbines. of 0.748&nbsp;lb per shp on trials which compared favourably with contemporary battleships.R&R, Ensign Four, Queen Elizabeth Class Battleships, p34Garzke & Dulin, p. 66. The French battlecruiser  achieved 0.753 lb/hr and 0.816 lb/hr on her preliminary and full power trials, respectively, in 1936. During full power trials on 10 December 1940, King George V at 41,630 tons displacement achieved 111,700 shp at 230 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0.715&nbsp;lb per shp.Brown 1995, p. 28.  After 1942 the Royal Navy was forced to use fuel oils with considerably higher viscosity and greater seawater content than these boilers could efficiently use.Gray and Killner, JNE, Volume 2, Book 4, January 1949, Sea Water Contamination of Boiler Fuel Oil – Part II The poor quality of the oil fuel combined with the seawater contamination to reduce the efficiency of the steam power plant and increased the maintenance required.JNE, Recent Improvements in Oil-Burning Equipment, Parts I, II, & III. The high seawater content was caused by a number of factors; the King George V class used fuel oil as part of the Side Protection System in the liquid layers of the SPS. As the fuel was consumed, water was allowed to enter the bottom of the layer to maintain its defensive qualities. The low viscosity fuel used in the early part of war resisted mixing with seawater and what seawater contamination did occur was easily removed. Additionally Britain's oil tanker fleet was relatively intact. After 1942 oil tanker losses to enemy attacks increased and the demands for more aviation fuel led to a degradation of bunker fuel used in steam driven naval vessels. This fuel readily absorbed seawater from older oil tankers that had increased propensity for seawater leakage, and from contact with seawater in the SPS system. It was also very much more difficult to remove the seawater once this poorer quality fuel was contaminated.  By 1944 the specific full power fuel consumption had increased to 0.8&nbsp;lb per shp and boiler maintenance was becoming increasingly difficult.JNE, Recent Improvements in Oil-Burning Equipment The Admiralty had been aware of this problem and were designing new types of oil sprayers and burners that could burn the available fuel oil much more efficiently, and sometime after 1944,JNE, Recent Improvements in Oil-Burning Equipment. Possibly post-war. Duke of York and Anson were fitted with new, higher pressure, oil sprayers and burners that restored the boilers to full efficiency. These same oil sprayers and burners were used in  along with other detail improvements so that Vanguard achieved a full power specific fuel consumption of 0.63&nbsp;lb per shpRaven and Roberts, p. 339 while using the same steam pressures and temperatures as used on the King George V class.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 236–297. The armour protection of the King George V-class battleships was designed after consideration of the Royal Navy's experience of World War I and upon testing between the wars.Raven and Roberts, p. 263 The design of this class was dominated by the provision of protection.Brown (2006), p. 29 Magazine protection was given priorityRaven and Roberts, p. 415 through the provision of a thick belt and deck armour and by placing the magazines at the lowest levels of the ship.Raven and Roberts, p. 285 The horizontal protection over the magazines consisted of three layers with a total thickness of 9.13&nbsp;inches; the weather deck consisted of 1.25&nbsp;inches of D steel,Okun, Nathan. Armor protection of the battleship KM Bismarck. D or Ducol steel was a High Tensile Steel developed after WW1. It had very good armour properties and was used extensively on the King George V-class battleships as a support for deck and belt armour and for hull, deck and splinter proof plating. This armour had approximately 25% greater resistance to penetration than earlier forms of armour, Brown (2006), p. 29 the main armoured deck was 5.88&nbsp;inches thick over a .5-inch DOkun, Nathan. Armor protection of the battleship KM Bismarck. steel deck and above the shell rooms there was another 1.5-inch splinter deck.Raven and Roberts, p. 284Garzke & Dulin, pp. 252–255 The powder magazines were below the shell rooms for added protection, a practice that was begun with the Nelson-class battleships. The weatherdeck thickness was the same over the machinery spaces but there the main armoured deck was reduced to 4.88&nbsp;inches over a .5-inch D steel deck. The main armoured deck was continued forward of the forward armoured bulkhead and gradually reduced from full thickness to 2.5&nbsp;inches, while aft of the after magazines an armoured turtle deck covered the steering gear with 4.5–5&nbsp;inches of armour whilst also providing protection along the waterline. The main armour belt was  high and covered the hull side from the main armoured deck to finish  below the deep waterline.Raven and Roberts, p. 154. Post-World War I studies had indicated that it was possible for delayed-action AP shells to dive under a shallow belt and penetrate into vital areas of the ship and therefore the main belt was made to extend as far below the waterline as possible.Garzke & Dulin, p. 230: "The armour thicknesses and underwater protection scheme evolved from tests completed prior to design work...tests on , , , and Empress of India [sic]  led to the conclusion that side armour should extend as far below the standard load waterline as practicable." Along the ship, the belt started just forward of the forward turret and finished just aft of the aft turret. The belt was at its thickest above and at the waterline. Along the magazines, the belt was 15&nbsp;inches thick (381&nbsp;mm);specifically 14.7 inches of cemented armour, composite material and 0.88 inches Ducol steel hull plate over the machinery spaces, the belt was 14&nbsp;inches (356&nbsp;mm). The lower section of belt tapered to a thickness of between 4.5&nbsp;in and 5.5&nbsp;in.Breyer, pp. 182–184 Armour protection was even better than the thickness of armour would indicate due to the improved qualities of the cementedface hardened armour which provided excellent resistance.Garzke (1980), p. 247: "Side armour protection of these ships was better than indicated in mere thickness tabulations, as the excellent quality of British Cemented armour provided the resistance of about 25% greater thickness of US Class "A" armour." The armoured belt, together with armoured bulkheads fore and aft and the armoured main deck, formed an "armoured citadel" protecting magazines and machinery. The armoured bulkhead was 12&nbsp;in (305&nbsp;mm) thick forward and 10&nbsp;in (254&nbsp;mm) thick at the after end of the citadel The main armoured belt extended forward and aft of the main armoured bulkheads with reduced height to protect the waterline and gradually reduced in thickness from 13 to 5.5&nbsp;inches. Immune zone calculations vary widely from source to source.ADM 239/268: C.B.04039, Armour Protection (1939)Raven and Roberts, p. 293 state:"...it was estimated that the belt armour would withstand 15 inch shells at a range of about 13,500 yards (15 inch armour) and 15,600 yards (14 inch armour) at normal inclination...". The Magazines were stated to withstand 15-inch plunging fire up to 33,500 yards.Garzke & Dulin (1980), p. 251, state: Against the British 15 inch Mark I naval gun, firing an 1,938&nbsp;lb shell, this protection scheme provided an immunity zone from 17,200 to 32,000 yards over the magazines, 19,500 to 28,000 yards over the machinery.Okun, Nathan. Armor protection of the battleship KM Bismarck. Nathan Okun calculated against the German 38 cm SK C/34 naval gun (15 inch) mounted on the contemporary s, the immunity zone was from 21,500 to 36,600 yards over the magazines, 23,800 to 33,200 yards over the machinery. Okun's calculations omit the 1.5" splinter deck over the magazine, as his article states that there is no armour over the magazines below the 5.88" armour deck. The armour provision was designed to offer protection from guns of a greater calibre than the class mounted themselves, and was on a scale second to none at the time the ships were designed. Indeed, the armour protection of these vessels was to be subsequently exceeded only by the Japanese battleships of the Yamato class.Burt, p. 395 The main gun turrets were relatively lightly protected in comparison to contemporary battleships.Garzke & Dulin (1980), pp. 252–255 Maximum turret and barbette armour was reduced to 12.75&nbsp;inches in this class from the 16&nbsp;inches of the Nelson class. The turret faces had 12.75 in (324&nbsp;mm) of armour at the front;  sides (at the gun chamber); 6.86&nbsp;inches (284–174&nbsp;mm) on the sides and rear; the roof plate was 5.88 in (149&nbsp;mm) thick. The main armament barbettes were of varying thickness: 12.75&nbsp;in (324&nbsp;mm) thick on the sides, 11.76&nbsp;in (298&nbsp;mm) forward and 10.82&nbsp;in (275&nbsp;mm) aft of the turret. To some extent the higher quality of the armour minimized the loss of protection and the turret's flat face improved ballistic resistance at long ranges, while the low profile of the turret minimized target area at closer ranges. The reduction in turret and barbette armour was a compromise in favour of the thickest possible protection for the magazines. The extensive anti-flash protection in the turrets and barbettes was designed to ensure that the magazines would remain safe even if the turrets and/or barbettes were penetrated. The secondary gun mounts, casements and handling rooms received only light plating of 0.98&nbsp;in (25&nbsp;mm) to protect against splinters. Unlike contemporary foreign battleships and the preceding Nelson-class battleships, the King George V class had comparatively light conning tower protection with 4&nbsp;inches (100&nbsp;mm) inches sides, 3&nbsp;in (75&nbsp;mm) forward and aft and a 1.47&nbsp;in (38&nbsp;mm) roof plate.Burt, p. 389. Side and front data from Burt, rest from Garzke.Garzke & Dulin (1980), p. 252 The RN's analysis of World War I revealed that command personnel were unlikely to use an armoured conning tower, preferring the superior visibility of unarmoured bridge positionsTestimony of Ted Briggs. For example, Captain Kerr and Admiral Holland commanded the Hood from her unarmoured bridge. Stability and weight considerations clearly played an important part in the British decision to limit superstructure armour. The conning tower armour was sufficient to protect against smaller ship guns and shell fragments.Garzke & Dulin (1980), p. 247  The hull below the waterline, along the main armour belt, formed the Side Protection System (SPS). It was subdivided into series of longitudinal compartments in a void-liquid-void layout; the outer and inner were filled with air, and the middle compartment with liquid (fuel or water). The outer hull plating in the region of the SPS was thin to reduce potential splinter damage from a torpedo. The outer compartment of the SPS was normally an empty or void space (containing only air) and this allowed the initial explosion from a torpedo to expand while minimizing damage to the ship. The centre compartment was filled with oil or seawater and this spread the pressure pulse over a larger area while the liquid contained any metal splinters that were created from the torpedo explosion. The inboard compartment was another void space and served to contain any liquid leaking from the liquid layer and any remaining pressure pulse from the torpedo explosion. Inboard of the final void space was an armoured bulkhead which varied in thickness from 1.5 in (37&nbsp;mm) over the machinery spaces to 1.75&nbsp;inch (44&nbsp;mm) abreast of the magazines. This bulkhead formed the "holding bulkhead" and it was designed to resist the residual blast effects from the torpedo hit. If this final inner bulkhead was penetrated a further set of subdivided compartments would contain any leaks; inboard of the holding bulkhead the ship was highly subdivided into small compartments containing auxiliary machinery spaces. The SPS void-liquid-void layer was generally about 13 feet wide, and the auxiliary machinery spaces added approximately another 8 feet of space from the outer hull plating to the major machinery spaces. The only exception to this was abreast A and B Engine Rooms, where the auxiliary machinery spaces were omitted, but another void space, about three feet wide was substituted in its place.Raven and Roberts,  pp. 294–297. Above the SPS, and directly behind the armour belt, was a series of compartments, typically used for washrooms or storage spaces, which were designed to allow for upward venting of overpressure from a torpedo hit. This scheme was designed to protect against a 1000&nbsp;lb warhead, and had been tested and found effective in full-scale trials.Brown, pp. 30–31 The SPS was also a key component of the ship's damage control system, as lists resulting from flooding could be corrected by counterflooding empty void spaces, and/or draining normally liquid filled compartments. In the case of the loss of the Prince of Wales these spaces were used for counterflooding to reduce list.Death of a Battleship p. 17  was sunk on 10 December 1941, from what was believed to have been hits by six aerial launched torpedoesMiddlebrook & Mahoney, p. 288. The figure of six hits seems to stem from post sinking analysis, probably by the Bucknill Committee and some survivor reports. However Appendix 1, Prince of Wales Compass Platform Narrative (recorded during the action) on pages 329–330, states four torpedo hits, one on the port side and three on the starboard side. Appendix 4, Post Action Statement by Gunnery Officer of HMS Prince of Wales, pages 338–339, by Lt Cdr McMullen, also states one torpedo hit on the port side and three on the starboard side. and a 500&nbsp;kg bomb. However, an extensive 2007 survey by divers of the wreck of Prince of Wales determined definitively that there had been only 4 torpedo hits. Three of these four hits had struck the hull outside the area protected by the SPS. In the case of the fourth, the SPS holding bulkhead appeared intact abreast the area where the hull was hit. The conclusion of the subsequent 2009 paper and analysisDeath of a Battleship, Garzke, Dulin and Denlay was that the primary cause of the sinking was uncontained flooding along "B" propeller shaft.B was the outermost shaft on the port side The propeller shaft external shaft bracket failed, and the movement of the unsupported shaft then tore up the bulkheads all the way from the external propeller shaft gland through to B Engine Room itself. This allowed flooding into the primary machinery spaces. The damage and flooding was exacerbated by poor damage control and the premature abandonment of the after magazines and a telephone communications switchboard.Garzke, Dulin & Denlay,  pp. 15–20 "B" propeller shaft had been stopped, and then restarted several minutes after being struck by a torpedo.Garzke, Dulin & Denlay, Subsequent inquiries into her loss at the timeMiddlebrook,  p. 310: "...the Second Bucknill Committee started its sittings...on 16 March 1942." identified the need for a number of design improvements, which were implemented to a lesser or greater degree on the other four ships of the class.Raven and Roberts, p. 388 Ventilation and the watertightness of the ventilation system were improved, while internal passageways within the machinery spaces were redesigned and the communications system made more robust.Raven and Roberts, p.297 Improved propeller shaft glands and shaft locking gear were introduced.Garzke & Dulin, p. 247 Some of the supposed failures of the ship were nevertheless predicated on the assumption that a torpedo had hit and defeated the SPS at or about frame 206Garzke & Dulin p. 368. Frame 206 is the location of a bulkhead that runs across the ship from port to starboard, about 1/3 of its length from the stern and separates Y Action Machinery Room from the Port Diesel Dynamo room. 'B' Engine Room begins about 20 feet forward of frame 206.Middlebrook, pp. 198–203 Middlebrook also assumed a hit at frame 206 based upon the Bucknill Committee analysis but discounted the likelihood of defeat of the SPS. at the same time as the hit that damaged B propeller shaft. The 2007 survey's  video footage evidence showed however that the hull is basically intact in this area.Death of a Battleship, Garzke, Dulin and Denlay. While the hull area around Frame 206 is indented, and with split seams and popped rivets, there is no torpedo hole. See 3D images made from the study of Expedition 'Job 74' video footage. The inability to survey the wreck during the war no doubt frustrated effortsMiddlebrook,  p. 311: "The committee could not have known two things: first, that the Japanese torpedoes contained only 330 or 450 lb of explosive charge (which knowledge would have only increased their dilemma) and secondly, that the extensive damage and flooding had been caused not by the explosion seen on Prince of Waless port side abreast frame 206 but by the unseen torpedo hit underneath the stern. This was the torpedo that damaged the bracket of the port-outer shaft, distorted the shaft itself, and permitted the vast inrush of water. It is small wonder that the committee was baffled..." to arrive at a definitive cause for the loss of Prince of Wales and, subsequently, that somewhat flawed analysisThe Bucknill Committee Inquiry, 1942 has led to a number of incorrect theories regarding the reasons for the sinking being inadvertently disseminated over the years.Garzke & Dulin, p. 241. This volume, for example, proposed three alternative theories based upon a torpedo hit or hits at frame 206 that defeated the SPS. On examination of the Prince of Wales after her encounter with the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser , three damaging hits were discovered which had caused about 400 tons of water, from all three hits, to enter the ship.ADM267/111 Battle Damage Sustained by H.M.S. Prince of Wales, 24 May 1941:"About 400 tons water in ship mainly abaft after bulkhead"Garzke & Dulin, p. 190, states that Captain Leach had informed Admiral Wake-Walker "...best speed was 27 knots because of 600 tons of flooding water...", but this is contradicted by the official damage report, ADM 267/111.234/509: Sinking of the 'Bismarck', 27 May 1941: Official Despatches, paragraph 24: "The effects of all this on her gunnery had been witnessed by the Rear-Admiral (Wake-Walker) Commanding, First Cruiser Squadron, and he knew, in addition, that her bridge was seriously damaged, that she had taken in 400 tons of water aft..." One of these hits, fired from Bismarck, had penetrated the torpedo protection outer bulkhead in a region very close to an auxiliary machinery space causing local flooding within the SPS, while the inner, 1.5-inch ( 2x19 mm)Garzke & Dulin, pp. 252, 234: "*Two plate construction"Tarrent, p. 31 D-steel holding bulkhead, however, remained intact, as the German shell was a dud. The German shell would have actually exploded in the water if its fuse had worked properly, due to the depth which the shell had to dive before striking the Prince of Wales under her armoured belt.Burt, p. 415 The King George V and the four other ships of the class as built carried ten BL 14 inch Mk VII naval guns, in two quadruple turrets fore and aft and a single twin turret behind and above the fore turret.Garzke & Dulin, p. 176 There was debate within the Admiralty over the choice of gun calibre;Roskill, Naval Policy between the wars, volume II pp. 327–329.This describes a normal debate within the Admiralty regarding gun size, armour, speed, torpedo protection and AA firepower and what should be the correct ratio between these attributes for the King George V battleships. In the end the Admiralty chose a ship with high speed, enhanced protection, heavy AA and 10 14-inch guns. The Admiralty controller wrote that a change to 15-inch guns would entail an 18-month delay (which would have meant no new RN battleships until 1942). Roskill noted that the London Naval Treaty stipulated a 14-inch maximum gun size, with an opt out clause, which Britain was very reluctant to exercise, since the Admiralty was hoping to persuade the other naval powers to stick to 14-inch guns. though there was little or no debate within Parliament;Hansard HC Deb 20 July 1936 vol 315 cc32-3Hansard HC Deb 20 July 1937 vol 326 cc2001-53Hansard HC Deb 20 July 1937 vol 326 cc2054-65 London Navy Treaty Bill.The member from Epping, Mr Churchill, criticised the choice of 14-inch main armament, as the US and Japan were believed to have selected 16-inch guns for their new ships, see also: Garzke & Dulin, p. 227 other European powers preferred 15-inch, and the USN, 16-inch main guns.Garzke & Dulin, p. 227 Initially the Admiralty studied vessels armed with a variety of differing main armament layouts including nine Garzke & Dulin, pp. 167–170 guns in three turrets, two forward and one aft. While this was well within the capabilities of the British shipyards, the design was quickly rejected as they felt compelled to adhere to the Second London Naval Treaty signed in 1936, and there was a serious shortage of skilled technicians and ordnance designers, along with compelling pressures to reduce weight. As a result, the class was designed to carry twelve 14-inch guns in three quadruple turrets and this configuration had a heavier broadside than the nine 15-inch guns. Unfortunately, it proved impossible to include this amount of firepower and the desired level of protection on a 35,000&nbsp;ton displacement,Garzke & Dulin, p. 175 and the weight of the superimposed quadruple turret brought the stability of the vessel into question. In the end, the second forward turret was changed to a smaller two gun turret in exchange for better armour protection, reducing the broadside weight to below that of the nine gun arrangement. The 14-inch Armour Piercing (AP) shell also carried a very largeNaval Weapons index, The KM 38 cm/52 SK C/34 carried a 41.4lb bursting charge, while the USN 16-inch Mk VI 2700 lb AP shell carried a 40.9lb bursting chargeUSN Bureau of Ordnance, Naval Ordnance 1937 Edition, paragraph 1318: "The impact damage which a projectile itself does is entirely secondary to that which results from its burst. The design of most naval projectiles is based primarily on using the projectile as a vehicle with which to carry a quantity of explosive into a ship and secondarily to provide missiles with which to carry the force of the explosion." bursting charge of  The armour-piercing capability of the gun and its ammunition is exhibited by the conning tower on the wreck of the German battleship Bismarck, which was given 14-inch thick armour, which is said to resemble a "Swiss cheese".Brown (2006), pp. 31, 35. Recent underwater inspection of the wreck of the Bismark showed that the 14 inch guns performed at least adequately in this action. The conning tower on Bismark had greater armour protection than its main belt, which had a maximum thickness of 12.6 inches. The last naval treaty had an escalator clause that permitted a change to 16-inch guns if another signatory did not conform to it by 1 January 1937. Although they could have invoked this clause, the effect would have been to delay construction and it was considered prudent to build with 14-inch rather than find themselves without the new battleships. The U.S. opted to absorb a delay and built its ships with larger guns.Friedman, pp. 270–271 In service, the quad turrets proved to be less reliable than was hoped for. Wartime haste in building, insufficient clearance between the rotating and fixed structure of the turret, insufficient full calibre firing exercises and extensive arrangements to prevent flash from reaching the magazines made it mechanically complex,Garzke & Dulin, p. 228 leading to problems during prolonged actions. In order to bring ammunition into the turret at any degree of train, the design included a transfer ring between the magazine and turret; this did not have sufficient clearance to allow for the ship bending and flexing.Brown Nelson to Vanguard (2000) p31 Improved clearances, improved mechanical linkages, and better training led to greater reliability in the quadruple turrets but they remained controversial. During the battle of the Denmark Strait against the German battleship Bismarck, the main battery of the newly commissioned  had mechanical problems: it started to fire three-round salvos instead of five-round salvoes, and there were problems in all except for the twin "B" turret.Tarrant, V.E.

Tarrant notes, on page 63 that "Information on Prince of Wales Gunnery is from PRO Adm 234/509" The main battery output was reduced to 74 percent (Bismarck and Prinz Eugen achieved 89% and 85% output, respectively) during the engagement, as out of seventy-four rounds ordered fired, only fifty-five were possible.Garzke and Dulin, 1980. pp. 189–190.Tarrant, V.E.

No.3 gun had problems with safety interlocks causing it to miss salvoes 15 to 20. At salvo 18 when Prince of Wales turned away, 2 of "Y" turrets guns were in operation. "Y" turrets shell transfer ring jammed at salvo 20, due to a shell sliding out of its tray due to the motion of the ship as Prince of Wales turned. The number of known defects in the main armament that was hampering 14-inch fire, the damage sustained and the worsening tactical situation forced Captain Leach to disengage from combat.Garzke & Dulin (1980), p. 190.The Bismarck Episode by Russel Grenfell, p. 54The loss of the Bismarck, by Graham Rhys-Jones, pp. 119–20German Capital Ships and Raiders in WW2, A naval Staff History, Battle Summary 5, p. 8The Battle of the Denmark Strait by John Asmussen With the range down to 14,500 yards and with five of his 14-inch guns out of action, Leach decided to break off his engagement with a superior enemy.Bennett, Naval Battles of WW2, p. 141 Roskill in the War at Sea (the official British history of the Second World War at sea), Volume 1, describes the decision to turn away: "In addition to the defective gun in her forward turret another 4 gun turret was temporarily incapacitated by mechanical breakdowns. In these circumstances Leach decided to break off the action and, at 0613, turned away under cover of smoke."Roskill SW, The War at Sea, Volume 1: The Defensive, 1954 p. 406Axis Battleships of WW2, Garzke and Dulin, p. 190, states: "As Prince of Wales turned away at 0613, Y turret jammed, temporarily leaving only two out of ten 14 inch guns operational". This is not supported by Bennett, Roskill and ADM 234–509. During the later action with Bismarck,  was also having trouble with her main battery, and by 0927 every gun missed at least one salvo due to failures in the safety interlocks for antiflash protection.Garzke & Dulin (1980), pp. 213–214: "At 0927 a shell hit the Bismarck...By that time KGV was having trouble with her main battery and every gun missed at least one salvo..." John Roberts wrote of main gunnery problems encountered by King George V: At 0847 Rodney opened fire...at a gun range of 23500 yards, followed by King George V one minute later at 24,600 yards...The Final Action by John Roberts, Warship 28, p. 264 Initially she [KGV] did well achieving 1.7 salvoes per minute while employing radar control but she began to suffer severe problems from 0920 onward [Note: KGV had opened fire at 0848 and fired for about 25 minutes at 1.7 salvoes per minute until 0913, when the type 284 radar broke down, but with no recorded loss of 14 inch gun output until 0920.The Final Action by John Roberts, Warship 28, pp. 264–268]. KGV recorded 14 straddles out of 34 salvoes fired from 0853 to 0913, when using her type 284 radar for ranging and spotting.The Final Action by John Roberts, Warship 28, pp. 264–265 'A' turret was completely out of action for 30 minutes [From 0920The Final Action by John Roberts, Warship 28, p. 268], after firing about 23 rounds per gun, due to a jam between the fixed and revolving structure in the shell room and Y turret was out of action for 7 minutes due to drill errors... Both guns in B turret, guns 2 and 4 in A turret and gun 2 in Y turret were put out of action by jams and remained so until after the action – 5 guns out of 10! There were a multitude of other problems with mechanical failures and drill errors that caused delays and missed salvos. There were also some misfires – one gun (3 of A turret) misfired twice and was out of action for 30 minutes before it was considered safe to open the breech. :—John Roberts, The Final Action During the early part of her action against the German capital ship Scharnhorst at the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December 1943, , firing under radar control in poor weather, scored 31 straddles out of 52 broadsides fired and during the latter part she scored 21 straddles out of 25 broadsides, a very creditable gunnery performance. In total, Duke of York fired 450 shells in 77 broadsides. "However, HMS Duke of York still fired less than 70% of her possible output during this battle because of mechanical and "errors in drill" problems."British 14"/45 (35.6 cm) Mark VII navweaps.com The King George Vs were the only battleships designed for the Royal Navy to use 14-inch guns and turrets. (HMS Canada, originally designed for Chile, had used 14-inch guns during the First World War.)  The QF 5.25 inch Mark I dual purpose gun has been dogged with controversy as well. The RN Gunnery Pocket Book published in 1945 states that: "The maximum rate of fire should be 10–12 rounds per minute.". Wartime experience revealed that the maximum weight which the loading numbers could handle comfortably was much lower than 80–90&nbsp;lb, and the weight of the 5.25-inch ammunition caused serious difficulties, allowing them to manage only 7–8 rpm instead of the designed 10–12 rpm.Campbell, 1985. p. 44 The mount had a maximum elevation of +70 degrees. The slow elevating and training speeds of the mounts were inadequate for engaging modern high-speed aircraft.Naval Weapons of the World From 1880 to Today – British 5.25"/50 (13.4 cm) QF Mark I Despite these issues, Prince of Wales was credited with several 5.25-inch kills during Operation Halberd,Garzke & Dulin, p. 191 and damaged 10 of 16 high level bombers in two formations during her last engagement, two of which subsequently crash landed.Garzke & Dulin, p. 195Garzke & Dulin, pp. 206-207  had her 5.25-inch turrets upgraded to RP10 controlCampbell, p. 45 which increased training and elevating speeds to 20 degrees per second.Unmodified the training speed was 10 degrees per second These ships were equipped with the HACS AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control clock for surface fire control of the secondary armament. The King George V-class design had four 0.5-inch quadruple machine gun mounts, but in 1939 these were replaced by two Mark VI pom-pom mounts. In 1940, to combat air attack, four Unrotated Projectile mountings were fitted, one on "B" turret, two on "Y" turret, and one replaced a pom-pom mount added in 1939 at the stern. The pom-poms mounted in the King George V were designed and produced by Vickers Armstrongs, as a result of a post-World War I requirement for a multiple mounting which was effective against close-range bombers or torpedo planes. The first model, tested in 1927, was a very advanced weapon for its timeCampbell p. 20 and in 1938 the Mark VI* had a muzzle velocity of 2,400 feet per second, a 1.594-inch bore and a barrel length of 40 calibres. They fired a 1.8-pound shell at a rate of 96–98 rounds per minute for controlled fire and 115 rounds per minute for automatic fire.Campbell p. 71 The range of the Mark VI* was 6,800 yards, at a muzzle velocity of 2,300 feet per second. The Mark VI octuple mount weighed 16 tons. The Mark VII quadruple mount weighed 10.8 tons if power operated; it could be elevated to 80 degrees and depressed to 10 degrees at a rate of 25 degrees per second which was also the rate of train. The normal ammunition supply on board for the Mark VI was 1,800 rounds per barrel.Garzke & Dulin, p. 229 King George V introduced the Mk IV Pom-pom director to the Royal Navy in 1940, becoming the first ship in the world to feature gyroscopic target tracking in tachymetric anti-aircraft directors.Campbell, p. 33Raven and Roberts, p. 291 The main guns of the King George V-class ships were controlled via two director control towers, one on top of the bridge superstructure and one aft of the mainmast, each of the control towers were equipped with 15&nbsp;ft rangefinders and fed targeting information to an Admiralty Fire Control Table, Mk IX. In the event that the control towers were disabled both "A" and "Y" turrets had internal 41&nbsp;ft rangefinders whilst "B" turret had 30&nbsp;ft rangefinders. The first two ships of the class to be completed, King George V and Prince of Wales, carried four HACS Mk IVGB directors for the ship's secondary 5.25-inch guns as well as six Mk IV pom-pom directors; all ten of these directors featured Gyro Rate Unit, tachymetric fire control. Whilst the Duke of York and Howe had HACS Mk V directors, with Anson having the Mk V directors replaced for the updated Mk VI.Raven and Roberts p. 284 King George V was the first ship of the class to join the Home Fleet on 11 December 1940 and her first action was providing distant cover for Operation Claymore in February 1941, before escorting Atlantic convoys, HX 114-115 during March.Chesneau, p. 7 Owing to the threat of the German battleship Bismarck, the Home Fleet sent King George V and the newly completed Prince of Wales on 22 May to help locate Bismarck, along with the battlecruiser  and six destroyers.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 177–179 On 24 May, Prince of Wales and Hood made contact with Bismarck and opened fire at 26,000 yards.Garzke & Dulin, p. 209 Prince of Wales sixth salvo straddled Bismarck and it was during this salvo, and one other, that she landed two decisive hits, holing Bismarck's bow, flooding a generator room, an auxiliary boiler room, and forcing the critical shutdown of two of her boilers, which led to Bismarck making the fateful decision to attempt to return to port.Garzke & Dulin, p. 177 During this time the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen had been solely targeting Hood and at 06:01 she blew up and sank, with the loss of all but three of her complement of 1,419 officers and men.Garzke & Dulin, p. 179 Following this, Captain Leach (Prince of Wales′s captain) gave the order to disengage, laying a heavy smokescreen to facilitate the retreat. Prince of Wales would attempt to reengage Bismarck on two more occasions, but owing to the distance being in excess of 20,000 yards was unable to land any more hits and was forced to return to Iceland to refuel and would play no further part in actions against Bismarck.Garzke & Dulin, p. 190 Meanwhile, King George V on 24 May was still 300 to 400 miles away from Bismarck and it wasn't until 27 May that King George V and  were able to engage Bismarck, due to a Swordfish torpedo bomber disabling Bismarck's steering gear on 26 May.Garzke & Dulin, p. 180 During the engagement King George V and Rodney were able to close to ranges of 16,000 yards and succeeded in disabling multiple turrets on Bismarck rending her unable to effectively engage the British ships. After 32 min of firing King George V had fired 335 14-inch shells at Bismarck, scoring multiple hits that contributed to Bismarck sinking soon after.Raven and Roberts, p. 351Garzke & Dulin, p. 214 After being repaired at Rosyth, Prince of Wales transported Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the United States for a conference with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that resulted in the Atlantic Charter being declared, which laid out how the allies intended to deal with the post-war world, on 14 August 1941.Chesneau, p. 12 Following the declaration of the charter, Prince of Wales on 24 September provided escort for Operation Halberd, with Prince of Wales downing several Italian aircraft on 27 September. On 25 October 1941, Prince of Wales departed home waters bound for Singapore, with orders to rendezvous with the battlecruiser Repulse and the aircraft carrier Indomitable, however, Indomitable ran aground in Jamaica and was unable to proceed. On 2 December the group docked in Singapore and Prince of Wales then became the flagship of the ill-fated Force Z under Vice-Admiral Sir Tom Phillips. The force then diverted to British Malaya as they had received intelligence that Japanese forces were landing there, however, this was a diversion and on 10 December the force was spotted by a Japanese submarine.Chesneau, pp. 12–13 At 11:00 the first Japanese air attack began against the force and at 11:30 Prince of Wales was struck by a torpedo. This led to rapid flooding and she began to take on a heavy list.  Prince of Wales was hit by three more torpedoes, before a 500 kg (1100&nbsp;lb) bomb hit the catapult deck, penetrating through to the main deck before exploding in the makeshift aid center causing numerous casualties. Several other bombs from this attack were very "near misses", which indented the hull, popped rivets and caused hull plates to "split" along their seams which intensified the flooding aboard Prince of Wales. At 13:15 the order was given to abandon ship and at 13:20 Prince of Wales capsized and sank with Vice-Admiral Phillips and Captain Leach being among the 327 fatalities.Chesneau, p. 13 The wreck lies upside down in  of water at .Rasor, p. 98 In October, King George V was involved in Operation EJ, which involved escorting the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious, whose aircraft attacked German shipping in the Glomfjord.HMS KING GEORGE V – King George V-class 14in gun Battleship Duke of York, the third ship of the class, first action was on 1 March 1942, when she provided close escort for convoy PQ 12 and was later joined by King George V on 6 March, as Admiral John Tovey believed that the German battleship Tirpitz would attempt to intercept the convoy, however, aircraft from Victorious were able to prevent Tirpitz from leaving its base in Norway.Garzke & Dulin, p. 216 During escort duty on 1 May 1942 King George V collided with the destroyer Punjabi, cutting Punjabi in two and damaging 40 feet of her own bow, resulting in King George V being sent to Gladstone Dock for repairs on 9 May before resuming escort duty on 1 July 1942. When the last two ships in the class, Howe and Anson were completed in late 1942, they were assigned to provide cover for convoys bound for Russia. On 12 September, Anson was joined by Duke of York in providing distant cover for convoy QP. 14. In October, Duke Of York was sent to Gibraltar to support the Allied landings in North Africa in November.Konstam, p. 43Rohwer, p. 221 On 31 December, Howe and King George V provided distant cover for arctic convoy RA. 51.Rohwer, p. 233Rohwer, p. 195Rohwer, p.219   Anson covered her last convoy on 29 January 1943, before being relocated, with Duke of York, to the Mediterranean. In June 1943, the two battleships took part in Operation Gearbox, which was designed to draw attention away from Operation Husky.Rohwer, p. 226Chesneau (2004), p. 15 At the same time, King George V and Howe were also relocated to the Mediterranean. They bombarded Trapani naval base on 12 July and defended Algiers against an air raid, before departing to take part in Operation Avalanche. Between 9 and 11 September they provided support for Operation Slapstick and later escorted the surrendered Italian fleet to Malta.Cheneau (2004), p. 16Konstam, p. 44Garzke & Dulin, p. 224 When the German battleship Scharnhorst was relocated to Norway, it was deemed necessary to provide heavy protection for all convoys bound for Russia. On 25 December, Scharnhorst was reported at sea. Initial contact was made by the cruisers of Force 1 (Belfast, Norfolk and Sheffield) but following a brief engagement, Scharnhorst was able to outdistance the cruisers.Garzke & Dulin, p. 218 Meanwhile, Force 2, which included Duke of York, was able to close to range and Duke of York opened fire on Scharnhorst, scoring multiple hits at ranges in excess of 12,000 yards. Scharnhorst scored two hits upon Duke of York during the engagement, both of which hit masts and failed to explode. One of the Duke of York shells exploded in Scharnhorsts number one boiler room, slowing her significantly and allowing British destroyers to close to torpedo range.Garzke, p. 219 Their torpedo hits allowed Duke of York to close to a range of 10,400 yards before opening fire once again. All Scharnhorsts turrets were silenced and shortly afterwards Scharnhorst sank with the loss of over 1,700 men.Garzke & Dulin, p. 220Chesneau, pp. 14–15 Following this, on 29 March 1944, Duke of York provided cover for convoy JW 58 and in August Duke of York and Anson provided cover for the aircraft carrier Furious, while it carried out air strikes against German targets in Norway as part of Operation Bayleaf. On 3 April, Duke of York provided cover for Operation Tungsten, which succeeded in damaging the German battleship Tirpitz.Rohwer, p. 314Garzke & Dulin, p. 221Garzke & Dulin, p. 222 In late March 1945, King George V and Howe began operations in the Pacific as part of Task Force 57. The first major operation that the task force undertook was Operation Iceberg, offshore support for the US landings at Okinawa, which started on 1 April.Chesneau, p. 10Garzke & Dulin, p. 215 During the operation King George V and Howe were subjected to sporadic Japanese kamikaze attacks, however, no damage was inflicted upon them by these attacks, while Howe succeeded in downing an attacking kamikaze plane. On 4 May, the two battleships led a forty-five-minute bombardment of Japanese air facilities in Ryukyu Islands.Garzke & Dulin, p. 225 In mid-July, they joined US battleships in a bombardment of industrial installations at Hitachi. During the Okinawa campaign, the pair supported British carriers. Their last offensive action was a night bombardment of Hamamatsu on 29 to 30 July 1945. Duke of York and Anson arrived too late to take part in hostilities, but on 15 August they accepted the surrender of Japanese forces occupying Hong Kong.Chesneau, p. 15 King George V and Duke of York were present at the official Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay. After the end of World War II, King George V became the flagship of the Home Fleet until December 1946, when it became a training vessel, before being scrapped in 1957.Chesneau, p. 215 Duke of York became the flagship of the Home Fleet after King George V, until April 1949, before being scrapped in 1957. Howe returned to Portsmouth in January 1946 and spent the remainder of her career there before being scrapped in 1957. Anson briefly served as the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet and helped to re-occupy Hong Kong, however, in 1949 she was placed into reserve before being scrapped in 1957.Garzke & Dulin, p. 223 Books           Name Pennant Namesake Builder Ordered Laid down Launched Commissioned Fate 41 HM King George V Vickers-Armstrong, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne 29 July 1936 1 January 1937 21 February 1939 1 October 1940 Broken up at Dalmuir, 1959 (ex-King Edward VIII) 53 Prince of Wales Cammell Laird, Birkenhead 3 May 1939 19 January 1941 Sunk in air attack in South China Sea, 10 December 1941 (ex-Anson) 17 Duke of York John Brown and Company, Clydebank 16 November 1936 5 May 1937 28 February 1940 19 August 1941 Broken up at Faslane, 1958 (ex-Jellicoe) 79 Admiral of the Fleet George Anson, 1st Baron Anson Swan Hunter, Wallsend 28 April 1937 20 July 1937 24 February 1940 14 April 1942 Broken up at Faslane, 1958 (ex-Beatty) 32 Admiral of the Fleet Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe Fairfields, Govan 1 June 1937 9 April 1940 17 June 1942 Broken up at Inverkeithing, 1958 Hein, David. “Vulnerable: HMS Prince of Wales in 1941.” (Abstract) Journal of Military History 77, no. 3 (July 2013): 955-989.
