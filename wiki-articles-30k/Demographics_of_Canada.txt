  This article is about the demographic features of the population of Canada, including population density, ethnicity, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population, the People of Canada.  The Canada 2011 Census had a total population count of 33,476,688 individuals, making up approximately 0.5% of the world's total population. Estimates have the population around 35 million as of December 2012. Sources: Statistics Canada     According to OECD/World Bank, the population in Canada increased from 1990 to 2008 with 5.6 million and 20.4% growth in population, compared to 21.7% growth in the United States and 31.2% growth in Mexico. According to the OECD/World Bank population statistics, between 1990–2008 the world population growth was 27%, a total of 1,423 million people.CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion Population 1971–2008 (pdf pages 83–85) IEA (OECD/ World Bank) original population ref e.g. in IEA Key World Energy Statistics 2010 page 57  Derived from: Statistics Canada – (table) Population and Dwelling Counts, for Canada, Provinces and Territories, 2011 and 2006 Censuses – 100% Data       Age characteristics: Net migration rate: 5.65 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2013 est.)

Percentages therefore add up to more than 100%. The most common response was 'Canadian'. As data is completely self-reported, and reporting individuals may have varying definitions of "Ethnic origin" (or may not know their ethnic origin), these figures should not be considered an exact record of the relative prevalence of different ethno-cultural ancestries but rather how Canadians self-identify. Statistics Canada projects that, by 2031, approximately 28% of the population will be foreign-born. The number of people belonging to visible minority groups will double,   and make up the majority of the population in Toronto and Vancouver. Counting both single and multiple responses, the most commonly identified ethnic origins were (2011): Data from the same subject matter, though from 2001, is also grouped more geographically by Statistics Canada as follows:  Percentages are calculated as a proportion of the total number of respondents (32,852,325 in 2011) and total more than 100% due to dual responses. All ethnocultural ancestries with responses totalling to more than 1% of the total number of responses are listed in the table above according to the exact terminology used by Statistics Canada. The most common ethnic origins per province are as followsEthnocultural Portrait of Canada – Select a geography (total responses; only percentages 10% or higher shown; ordered by percentage of "Canadian"): Statistics Canada identifies visible minorities in accordance with the Employment Equity Act.
