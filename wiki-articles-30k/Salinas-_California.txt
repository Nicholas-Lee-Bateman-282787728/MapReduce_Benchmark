   Salinas  is the county seat and largest municipality of Monterey County, California. Salinas is located  east-southeast of the mouth of the Salinas River, at an elevation of about  above sea level. The population was 155,662 as of 2013. The city is located at the mouth of the Salinas Valley roughly eight miles from the Pacific Ocean and has a coastal climate. The city consists mostly of late 20th century single family homes and low-level apartments, ranging from modest bungalows to spacious luxury homes, and serves as the main business, governmental and industrial center of the region. The marine climate is ideal for the floral industry, grape vineyards, and vegetable growers. Salinas is known for its  vibrant and large agriculture industry and as the hometown of writer and Nobel Prize in Literature laureate John Steinbeck, who based several of his novels there.  The land currently occupied by the city of Salinas is thought to have been settled by Native Americans known as the Esselen prior to 200 AD."The Esselen Indians of the Big Sur Country" by Gary S. Breschini and Trudy Haversat Between 200 and 500 AD, they were displaced by the Rumsen group of Ohlone speaking people, who were the inhabitants at contact with the Spanish. Large Spanish land grants for the Catholic Missions and as bonuses to soldiers gave way to Mexican land grants for smaller ranchos where mostly cattle were grazed, and a thriving trade in cattle hide came through the Port of Monterey."Early Salinas" by Gary S. Breschini, Mona Gudgel, & Trudy Haversat California officially was a part of the United States of America in 1850, following several years of battles in the Salinas area with John Fremont flying the American flag on the highest peak of the Gabilan Mountains and claiming California for the United States. Before this time, Monterey was the capital of California and had been under military rule after the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo at the end of the Mexican-American war. The Salinas post office opened in 1854. A traveler's inn called the Halfway House at the intersection of two stage coach routes was built in 1856 and a settlement grew up there. The streets of Salinas were laid out in 1867, and the town was incorporated in 1874. The city was named after the word for a "salt marsh" in Spanish, salinas. The conversion of grazing land to crops and the coming of the rail road in 1868 to transport goods and people was a major turning point in the history and economic advancement of Salinas. Dry farming of wheat, barley, and other grains as well as potatoes and mustard seed was common in the 1800s. Chinese labor drained thousands of acres of swampland to become productive farmland, and as much early farm labor was done by Chinese immigrants, Salinas boasted the second largest Chinatown in the state, slightly smaller than San Francisco."10,000 Years on the Salinas Plain" by Gary S. Breschini, Mona Gudgel, & Trudy Haversat  Irrigation changed farming in Salinas to mainly row crops of root vegetables, grapes and sugar beets. Many major vegetable producers placed their headquarters in Salinas. The historic prevalence of row crops is documented by aerial photographic interpretation of Earth Metrics,Earth Metrics Inc. Driven by the profitable agricultural industry, Salinas had the highest per capita income of any city in the United States in 1924. Following World War II major urban and suburban development converted much farmland to city. The city experienced two particularly strong growth spurts in the 1950s and 1960s, and again in the 1990s and early 2000s. Aerial photographic interpretation indicate such major conversion of cropland to urban uses over the time period 1956 to 1968,U.S.G.S. Map May 14, 1956 ABG-6R-5, #75 1:20,000U.S.G.S.

Salinas was also the birthplace of writer and Nobel Prize laureate John Steinbeck. The historic downtown, known as Oldtown Salinas, features much fine Victorian architecture, and is home to the National Steinbeck Center, the Steinbeck House and the John Steinbeck Library. Major development took place in the 1990s, with the construction of Creekbridge, Williams Ranch, and Harden Ranch.Salad days near end in lettuce capital as development boom encroaches. The Baltimore Sun. Traditionally an Anglophonic European American settlement, Salinas became home to a significant Asian minority who joined European-American immigrants in the agriculture and fishing industries at the turn of the 20th century. Meanwhile, the neighboring and, at the time, unincorporated community of Alisal became a mecca for Hispanic immigrants primarily from Mexico, drawn to opportunities in the area’s agricultural industry. When annexed in 1963, Alisal was described as a large Mexican-American enclave, added to a city that was still otherwise majority European-American. Hispanic immigration peaked from the 1980s through the early 2000s. Mostly European-American neighborhoods in North Salinas, an expansion of the original city built mostly in the 1950s and 60s, became majority Latino by 2010. As Latino immigrants and their descendants became more affluent and established, the proportion of Hispanics increased in the city’s more affluent South and North-East. From the time it was first built in the late 1980s, to the 2000 Census, Creekbridge – the city’s highest income area, least affected by poverty - remained mostly European-American and minority Latino. By 2010, however, US-born Latinos had become the largest ancestry group in the area. In South Salinas, the city’s original area and most European-American section, Hispanics typically constitute over 40% of residents. Despite its key role in the city’s early development and significant Filipino immigration over recent decades, the Asian-American community of Salinas remains small compared to California average. The highest concentration of Asian-Americans is found in Creekbridge, where they constitute roughly 1 in 5 residents. Along with the great influx of legal immigrants was an influx of undocumented immigrants. By 2011, Salinas had one of the highest concentrations of unauthorized immigrants in the state and nationwide. Of the city’s three main zip codes, two had 10%-15% of residents being unauthorized immigrants, and a third over 15%. The fear many undocumented immigrants have of government authorities has been a great obstacle faced by local law enforcement in crime investigations, community relations, and gathering information needed for effective policing. As a result, Salinas police department policy is to not verify immigration status of individuals coming into contact with city police officers. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , 99.84% of it land and 0.16% of it water. Prior to mass agricultural and urban development, much of the city consisted of rolling hills bisected by wooded creeks and interspersed with marsh land. Today, the city is located mostly on leveled ground, with some rolling hills and wooded gulches with creeks remaining in the north-eastern Creekbridge and Williams Ranch neighborhoods, as well as the Laurel Heights section of East Salinas. The natural ecosystems accompanying the area's topography and environment have been recreated in Natividad Creek Park and adjacent Upper Carr Lake. The city rests about  above sea level, and it is located roughly eight miles from the Pacific Ocean. The Gabilan and Santa Lucia mountain ranges border the Salinas Valley to the east and to the west, respectively. Both mountain ranges and the Salinas Valley run approximately  south-east from Salinas towards King City. The Salinas River runs the length of the Salinas Valley and empties into the Pacific Ocean at the center of the Monterey Bay. During the summer months the river flows partially underground and it is this extensive underground aquifer that allows for irrigation of cropland in an area without much annual rainfall.  Salinas has cool and moderate temperatures, due to the "natural air conditioner" that conveys ocean air and fog from the Monterey Bay to Salinas, while towns to the north and south of Salinas experience hotter summers, as mountains block the ocean air. Thus, Salinas weather is closer to that of the Central Coast of California, rather than that of inland valleys, and thus has a mild Mediterranean climate with typical daily highs ranging from around  in the winter to around  in the summer. According to the Weather channel, monthly average temperature highs range from 61 to 75 F. The record highest temperature was  on September 14, 1971. The record lowest temperature was  on December 21, 1937. Annually, there are an average of 5.5 days with + highs, and an average of 11.7 days with lows reaching the freezing mark or lower. Salinas is in the top ten American Cities for cleanest air quality. The offshore marine layer generates winds that blow smog further inland). The difference between ocean and air temperature also tends to create heavy morning fog during the summer months, known as the marine layer, driven by an onshore wind created by the local high pressure sunny portions of the Salinas Valley, which extend north and south from Salinas and the Bay. The average annual rainfall for the city is approximately . The wettest year on record was 1998 with  of precipitation. The driest year was 2004 with . The most precipitation in one month was  in February 1998.  The record maximum 24-hour precipitation was  on January 23, 2000. Occasionally, there is snowfall on the peaks of the Gabilan and Santa Lucia mountain ranges, but snow in the city itself is extremely rare, occurring about once every 5 to 15 years on average. An inch of snow fell in Salinas on February 26, 2011.   As of the 2008-2012 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, Salinas tended to be poorer and less educated than California and the nation as a whole, with the notable exception of sizable neighborhoods in the southern and north-eastern portions of the city (see thematic maps and table below). The most affluent and educated neighborhoods in Salinas are Creekbrige (North-East) and South Salinas. Hebbron Heights/central East Salinas was the poorest and least educated - as it has been since the Alisal area containing it was annexed by the city in 1963. While most neighborhoods saw 1 in every 4-to-6 residents live in poverty, only 1 in 25 residents lived in poverty in Creekbridge - the by far lowest rate in the city and less than a third of state and national average. Regarding educational attainment, the pattern was different. There remained a significant disparity across the city, but the city's most affluent neighborhoods failed to exceed national or statewide averages despite having significantly higher incomes and lower poverty than California or the nation as a whole.

East Salinas and the downtown area suffered from a very low median household income as well as high crime rates. South and North Salinas featured roughly the same level of median households income with the latter being home to city's wealthiest newly constructed neighborhoods. Salinas has long had a well-recognized, significant problem with organized street gangs and associated violent crime. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the city's overall violent crime and homicide rates are significantly above those for California and the nation overall, although the overall violent crime has declined since 2000. Gang activity and violent crime are focused in the poorer parts of central and central East Salinas and exacerbated by the city's comparatively low tax base and consequently limited policing resources. A hypothesis to explain the city's particularly intense problem with gang related violent crime cites the city's proximity to Salinas Valley State Prison. The prison was an early launch pad for street operations of the notorious prison gang, Nuestra Familia. This in turn, is seen as having spawned a legacy of multi-generational gang membership among the poorer and less educated residents of East Salinas. Violent Crimes and Homicides per 100,000 residents (US Bureau of Justics Statistics, 2014) Salinas boasts an emerging arts scene led by the First Fridays Art Walk and the innovative use of non-traditional or business venues to exhibit art and host live local music.
