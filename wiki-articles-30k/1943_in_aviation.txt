August 17–18 (overnight) – 596 Royal Air Force bombers attack the German ballistic missile research station at Peenemünde for the first time in a raid especially designed to kill as many German scientists and other workers as possible before they can reach air raid shelters. They kill nearly 200 people in the accommodations area, but also mistakenlhy bomb a nearby prison camp for foreign slave workers, killing 500 to 600 there. For the first time, the British bombers fly a route intended to trick German night fighter forces into deploying to defend the wrong target. Also for the first time, the British employ the new Spotfire 250-lb (113-kg) target indicator. Forty British bombers (6.7 percent) fail to return. The raid sets the German ballistic missile program back at least two, and perhaps more than six, months.Hinchcliffe, Peter, The Other Battle: Luftwaffe Night Aces vs. Bomber Command, Edison, New Jersey: Castle Books, 1996, ISBN 978-0-7858-1418-4, pp. 177-179.

August 23–24 (overnight) – Royal Air Force Bomber Command resumes the bombing of Berlin with a raid by 727 bombers. Poor target marking, poor timing by bombers, and the difficulty H2S navigation radar has in identifying landmarks in Berlin lead to wide scattering of bombs, although the Germans suffer nearly 900 casualties on the ground. For the first time, the Germans employ new Zahme Sau ("Tame Boar") tactics – the use of ground-based guidance to direct night fighters into the British bomber stream, after which the night fighters operate independently against targets they find – and the British lose 56 bombers, the highest number so far in a single night and 7.9 percent of the participating aircraft.Hinchcliffe, Peter, The Other Battle: Luftwaffe Night Aces vs. Bomber Command, Edison, New Jersey: Castle Books, 1996, ISBN 978-0-7858-1418-4, p. 186. August 25 – A Luftwaffe aircraft scores the first hit on a target in history using a guided missile, striking the Royal Navy sloop  in the Bay of Biscay with a Henschel Hs 293 glide bomb. The warhead does not explode, and damage to Bideford is minimal. In the same strike, an Hs 293 slightly damages the Royal Navy patrol vessel  with a near miss. August 27 – Guided missiles sink a ship for the first time, when a squadron of 18 German Dornier Do 217s launching Henschel Hs 293 glide bombs sinks the Royal Navy sloop  in the Bay of Biscay with the loss of 198 lives.HMS Egret (L 75 / U 75)  In the same strike, the Royal Canadian Navy destroyer  suffers heavy damage from Hs 293 hits, while the Royal Navy destroyer  evades damage by out-turning the Hs 293s as the German bombers launch them at her one at a time. The loss of Egret and damage to Athabaskan lead the Allies to halt antisubmarine patrols in the Bay of Biscay by surface ships.Milner, Marc (1994). The U-boat hunters: the Royal Canadian Navy and the offensive against Germany's submarines. University of Toronto Press, p. 57 August 27–28 (overnight) – 674 British bombers attack Nuremberg, suffering the loss of 33 aircraft. Despite clear skies, it is very dark and many aircraft have trouble with their H2S radar sets and with hearing the directions of the Master Bomber, and results are unsatisfactory. August 30 – A Qantas Empire Airways PBY Catalina flying boat on the "Double Sunrise Route" from Ceylon to Perth, Australia, completes the longest non-stop scheduled airline flight in history. From mooring buoy to mooring buoy, the flight takes 31 hours 51&nbsp;minutes.Wilkinson, Stephan, "The PBYs That Flew Forever," Aviation History, July 2011, p. 53. August 30–31 (overnight) RAF Bomber Command dispatches 660 bombers to attack Mönchengladbach and Rheydt, Germany.

August 31 &ndash; Serving in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, American professional football player Len Supulski dies along with seven other men in the crash of a B-17 Flying Fortress near Kearny, Nebraska, during a training flight. August 31-September 1 (overnight) &ndash; RAF Bomber Command sends 622 bombers to attack Berlin. For the first time, the Luftwaffe employs illuminator aircraft &ndash; Junkers Ju 88s dropping flares &ndash; to provide light for attacking "Wild Boar" fighters. Cloud cover, H2S problems, and stiff German resistance cause Pathfinder aircraft to drop their markers well south of the target area and lead the bombers to scatter their bombs as much as 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) back along the approach route to Berlin, suggesting that Bomber Command crews are turning back early in the face of increasing losses. Forty-seven bombers do not return; although this is only 1.6 percent of the overall force, the loss rate among Handley Page Halifaxes is 11.4 percent and that among Short Stirlings is 16 percent. German fighters have shot down two-thirds of the lost bombers. Despite the raids failure, it prompts Gauleiter of Berlin Josef Goebbels to order all children and all adults not engaged in war work to be evacuated from Berlin to the countryside and to towns in eastern Germany where air raids are not expected.Royal Air Force Bomber Command 60th Anniversary Campaign Diary August 1943Hinchcliffe, Peter, The Other Battle: Luftwaffe Night Aces vs. Bomber Command, Edison, New Jersey: Castle Books, 1996, ISBN 978-0-7858-1418-4, p. 190.

A counterstrike by 108 Japanese Zero fighters, Aichi D3A "Val" dive bombers, and Nakajima B5N "Kate" torpedo bombers and a number of Mitsubishi G4M ("Betty") bombers is ineffective. The U.S loses 11 aircraft, while the Japanese lose 39 single-engine planes and several G4Ms. During operations from shore bases at Rabaul, Japanese carrier aircraft have lost 50 percent of their fighters, 85 percent of their dive bombers, and 90 percent of their torpedo bombers in less than two weeks.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, pp. 330-336. The last unit of the former U.S. Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command, the 480th Antisubmarine Group, is disbanded, and all American antiubmarine activities become the responsibility of the U.S. Navy.Schoenfeld, Max, Stalking the U-Boat: USAAF Offensive Antisubmarine Operations in World War II, Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1995, ISBN 978-1-56098-403-0, p. 160. The U.S. Army Air Forces antisubmarine effort has sunk 12 German submarines.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume X: The Atlantic Battle Won May 1943-May 1945, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1990, p. 29. November 11–12 (overnight) 134 British bombers raid the railroad marshalling yards at Cannes, France, and the main railway line between France and Italy, losing four aircraft. The raid fails to hit the railroad yards and succeeds only in inflicting blast damage on railway workshops. After Bomber Commands No. 617 Squadron completes its training to operate from high altitudes following the abandonment of low-level missions by heavy bombers, 10 of the squadrons Lancasters attack French railroads with 12,000-pound (5,443-kg) bombs, scoring one hit on a railroad viaduct at Anthéor. November 12 – A strike by five Japanese Mitsubishi G4M ("Betty") bombers damages the light cruiser  off Bougainville.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, p. 346. November 13 – American preparatory bombing for the amphibious landings in the Gilbert Islands begins with a strike by 17 U.S. Army Air Forces B-24 Liberators against Japanese forces on Betio island at Tarawa Atoll. For the next week, B-24s raid Betio, Butaritari, or both every day, Mili four times, and Jaluit and Maloelap twice each, destroying several Japanese aircraft. Japanese aircraft strike Nanumea and Funafuti once each, destroying one B-24 and damaging two.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, p. 98. November 17 – Air Solomons (AirSols) fighters intercept 35 Japanese planes heading for a strike on the U.S. landings on Bougainville, shooting down 16 for the loss of two F4U Corsairs. A Japanese torpedo bomber sinks a U.S. destroyer-transport off Bougainville with heavy loss of life.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, pp. 350, 351. November 17–18 – 83 British bombers make a completely blind bombing raid on Ludwigshafen. Germany, guided only H2S radar. British radio broadcasts succeed in misdirecting most German night fighters to land too early to intercept them, and only one Lancaster is lost. November 18–19 – Carrier aircraft from , , and  strike the island of Betio at Tarawa Atoll, inflicting considerable damage on Japanese forces there.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, p. 149. November 18–19 (overnight) – Bomber Commands "Battle of Berlin" begins with a raid by 444 bombers on Berlin, of which nine (2 percent) are lost; few German night fighters intercept them, but Berlin is covered by cloud and they bomb blindly with unknown results. German night fighters successfully intercept a major diversionary raid by another 395 British bombers on Mannheim and shoot down 23 bombers (5.9 percent of the force). Mannheim also is cloud-covered and the raid scatters its bombs largely outside the city, but nonetheless kills 21 people, injures 154, and renders 7,500 homeless. It is the last raid on Mannheim for 15 months. November 19–20 (overnight) – 266 British bombers attack Leverkusen, Germany, in bad weather, which prevents most German night fighters from intercepting them but also makes them scatter their bombs so widely that only one bomb lands in Leverkusen, with other bombs hitting at least 27 other towns well to the north. Five bombers (1.9 percent of the force) are lost. November 20 – Operation Galvanic, the American invasion of the Gilbert Islands, begins with amphibious landings on Betio island at Tarawa Atoll and on Butaritari. The invasion is supported by 11 fleet and light aircraft carriers, eight escort aircraft carriers, and land-based aircraft of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army Air Forces Seventh Air Force. To oppose them, the Japanese have only 46 aircraft in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands combined. During the evening, Japanese torpedo bombers hit the aircraft carrier  with on torpedo, forcing her to withdraw for repairs but losing eight of their number; it is the only damage Japanese aircraft inflict on any American ship during the Gilbert Islands campaign.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, pp. 114-118, 120, 121, 138, 142, 336-340. November 22–23 – Bomber Command mounts its largest raid on Berlin to date, dispatching 746 bombers. Despite having to bomb in weather bad enough to ground most German night fighters, the bombers conduct one of the most successful raids of the war, creating several firestorms with smoke reaching an altitude of 19,000 feet (6,000 meters), rendering 175,000 people homeless, and damaging many sights and attractions in central Berlin as well as several factories and government buildings. Twenty-six British bombers (3.4 percent of the force) are lost. It is the last time that Short Stirlings participate in a raid against a target in Germany. November 23–24 (overnight) – 383 British bombers attack Berlin with the loss of 20 of their number (5.2 percent of the force). Although cloud cover interferes with target maerking, bomber crews are able to bomb using 11 major fires still burning from the previous night as aiming points and inflict further heavy damage on the city. November 24 The Japanese submarine I-175 torpedoes and sinks the U.S. Navy escort aircraft carrier  20 nautical miles (37&nbsp;km) southwest of Butaritari with the loss of 644 lives, including that of Rear Admiral Henry M. Mullinnix; there are 272 survivors.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, pp. 139-141. The first Allied aircraft – a damaged U.S. Marine Corps SBD Dauntless dive bomber – lands on Bougainville.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, p. 362. November 25–26 (overnight) Japanese aircraft attack American ships east of the Gilbert Islands, scoring no hits. 262 British bombers raid Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, losing 12 aircraft (4.6 percent of the force). November 26 Per orders from Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, the Luftwaffe puts on a display of Germany's most advanced aircraft and aerial weapons at Insterburg, East Prussia, for Adolf Hitler. During his 90-minute visit, Hitler appears bored with the Dornier Do 335 fighter, the Junkers Ju 390 long-range bomber/transport/maritime patrol plane, the Fieseler Fi-103 manned flying bomb, the Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship missile, the Fritz X anti-ship glide bomb, a Junkers Ju 88 equipped with special equipment for laying smoke screens, and panoramic radars and the Korfu receiving set for tracking enemy bombers, and he does not view the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket fighter at all. He pauses at the Junkers Ju 290 bomber/transport/maritime patrol plane and orders that one be made available as his personal aircraft.  He shows great interest in the Arado Ar 234 jet bomber, ordering that 200 be built by the end of 1944, and is most excited by the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, two of which make demonstration flights. Informed by Willy Messerschmitt that it could be adapted to carry one or two 250-kg (551-pound) bombs, Hitler orders that the Me 262 be produced as a bomber rather than a fighter, delaying its entry into service.Dorr, Robert F., "German Jets at Insterburg: Hitler's Excellent Airshow," defensemedianetwork.com, December 11, 2013. A Henschel Hs 293 glide bomb launched by a Luftwaffe Heinkel He 177 sinks the British troopship HMT Rohna in the Mediterranean Sea with the loss of 1,138 lives. Among the dead are 1,015 U.S. military personnel, and 35 American survivors later die of their wounds; it is the largest loss of life experienced by the U.S. armed forces in a single incident at sea., pp. 25, 31, 101. November 26–27 (overnight) Japanese aircraft again strike American ships off the Gilbert Islands, scoring no hits. They encounter the first aircraft-carrier-based night combat air patrol in history, consisting of a TBF Avenger torpedo bomber and two F6F Hellcat fighters. The Avenger shoots down one Japanese plane, but Lieutenant Commander Edward H. "Butch" O'Hare, the U.S. Navys second ace in history and first of World War II, is shot down and killed flying one of the Hellcats;Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, pp. 142-143. he has seven victories at the time of his death. Bomber Command dispatches 450 bombers to attack Berlin; they scatter their bombs, but add to the damage to the city center and suburbs. German night fighters intercept them, and 28 Lancasters (6.2 percent of the force) are lost and 14 more crash upon reaching England. A diversionary raid on Stuttgart by 173 more bombers scatters its bombs and loses six additional bombers (3.4 percent of the force). November 28 – Japanese resistance on Tarawa Atoll ends. American aircraft carriers depart the Gilbert Islands area before the end of the month.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, p. 178. The Venezuelan airline Avensa makes its first flights. December 1 – The United States reopens the former Japanese airfield on Betio at Tarawa Atoll as Hawkins Field for use by fighters. In mid-December, it will begin to handle heavy bombers as well.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, p. 211. December 2 – A night raid by 105 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers surprise the brilliantly lit Italian port of Bari while it is crowded with about 30 Allied ships, meeting little opposition. A sheet of flame from a burning tanker spreads over the harbor; 16 ships carrying 38,000 tons (34,473,374&nbsp;kg) of cargo are destroyed, eight are damaged, and a quantity of mustard gas is released from the cargo of one stricken ship; at least 125 American personnel alone are killed; and the port does not return to full operations for three weeks. It is the most destructive single air raid against shipping since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume IX: Sicily-Salerno-Anzio, January 1943-June 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1990, pp. 321-322. December 2–3 (overnight) – 458 British bombers attack Berlin, scattering their bombs widely across the southern part of the city and the countryside beyond due to adverse winds but nonetheless causing some damage to factories and destroying 136 buildings. German night fighters intercept the raid and the British lose 40 bombers (8.7 percent of the force). December 3–4 (overnight) Japanese Rabaul-based aircraft attack U.S. ships approaching Bougainville Island.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, pp. 360-361. 527 British bombers raid Leipzig, Germany, with the American broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow riding as an observer in a Lancaster of No. 619 Squadron. The most successful attack on Leipzig of the war, it inflicts heavy damage on housing and industrial buildings. During the return flight to England, the bombers mistakenly fly over the defenses of Frankfurt-am-Main, where many are shot down. Twenty-four bombers do not return, a 4.6 percent loss rate. December 4 U.S. Navy carrier aircraft strike Kwajalein Atoll. Those from  and  concentrate on Roi, where they shoot down 28 Japanese aircraft and destroy 19 on the ground, sink a large cargo ship, and damage the light cruiser Isuzu; those from  and  strike Kwajalein Island, where they destroy 18 floatplanes, sink three merchant ships, and damage the light cruiser Nagara. A combined total of five American aircraft are lost. Twenty-nine Yorktown aircraft raid Wotje later in the day. Japanese aircraft attack the retiring carrier force during the afternoon and overnight, damaging Lexington with a torpedo in exchange for the loss of 29 Japanese planes.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, pp. 191-197. The U.S. Navy submarine  torpedoes and sinks the Japanese aircraft carrier Chūyō near Hachijōjima with the loss of over 1,243 lives, including 20 American prisoners-of-war. December 8 – Aircraft from the U.S. Navy carriers  and  strike Nauru in cooperation with a bombardment by surface warships; eight or ten of the 12 Japanese planes on the island are destroyed.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, pp. 197-198. December 10 – The Allied airstrip at Cape Torokina on Bougainville officially opens. December 13 – Since November 14, the Japanese have lost 122 aircraft based in the Marshall Islands. December 14 – Aircraft of the U.S. Army Air Forces Fifth Air Force attack Japanese forces at Arawe with 433 tons (393&nbsp;metric tons) of bombs.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, p. 373. December 15 – Fifth Air Force aircraft cover U.S. Army landings at Arawe. A strike on the landing forces by 64 Japanese naval aircraft is unsuccessful.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, pp. 373-376. December 16–17 – Almost continuous unopposed Japanese air attacks on the landing force at Arawe damage and destroy various U.S. landing craft and small craft.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, p. 376. December 16–17 (overnight) 493 British bombers attack Berlin. German night fighters intercept them continuously from the coast of the Netherlands all the way to the target, and 25 Lancasters (5.2 percent of the force) are shot down; the raid sees the first use of the British Serrate radar homing system, which four British night fighters use to attack German night fighters along the bombers route, and they damage one Messerschmitt Bf 110. Most of the bombs fall on the city; the damage to railroads combines with people using trains to escape the bombing to delay supplies to German forces on the Eastern Front, and damage inflicted by this attack combines with that of earlier attacks to leave one-quarter of Berlins housing destroyed. An additional 29 Lancasters crash upon returning to England due to low cloud cover at their bases. RAF Bomber Command sends 47 bombers against two V-1 flying bomb launch sites near Abbeville, France. One raid fails, but the other, by No. 617 Squadron Lancasters employing 12,000-pound (5,443-kg) Tallboy bombs, damages its target. December 15–25 – Japanese aircraft at Rabaul bomb U.S. forces on Bougainville nightly, killing 38 and wounding 136. December 17 – For the first time, the Cape Torokina airstrip on Bougainville is used to stage the first Air Solomons (AirSols) raid on Rabaul. December 20–21 (overnight) – 650 British bombers raid Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany. German night fighters intercept them successfully and 41 British aircraft (6.3 percent) are lost.  Despite the scattering of bombs due to cloud cover – which even leads to the city of Mainz being hit by mistake – the raid inflicts significant damage on Frankfurt-am-Main.  A diversionary raid on Mannheim mostly misses the city but suffers no losses. December 21 – Rabaul-based Japanese aircraft make three dive-bombing attacks on U.S. forces unloading at Arawe.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, pp. 376-377. December 21–30 – Butaritari-based U.S. Army Air Forces Douglas A-24 Banshee dive bombers make nine strikes on Mili and one on Jaluit.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, p. 213. December 23 – American aircraft based at Tarawa strike Nauru.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, p. 212. December 23–24 – 379 British bombers raid Berlin, losing 16 (4.2 percent) of their number. They scatter their bombs widely due to cloud cover. December 23–25 – Air Solomons (AirSols) aircraft strike Rabaul heavily, U.S. Navy carrier aircraft strike Kavieng on New Ireland, and Fifth Air Force aircraft attack Japanese positions at Cape Gloucester and Cape Hoskins on New Britain.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, p. 383. December 26 – 70 to 80 Japanese Rabaul-based aircraft attack U.S. ships supporting the days U.S. landing at Cape Gloucester, sinking a destroyer and damaging two others. Minor raids follow on the next two days.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, p. 385-386. December 26–27 – Japanese Rabaul-based aircraft raid U.S. forces off Arawe.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VI: Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, 22 July 1942-1 May 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1988, p. 377. December 28 – American aircraft based at Tarawa strike Nauru. December 29–30 (overnight) – 712 British bombers strike Berlin with the loss of 20 aircraft (2.8 percent of the force). Cloud cover makes them scatter their bombs, with many missing the city. December 31 Japanese Rabaul-based aircraft raid U.S. forces off Arawe, losing four aircraft. Since mid-December, when they began staging through Tarawa Atoll, U.S. Army Air Forces B-24 Liberators have dropped 601 tons (545,227&nbsp;kg) of bombs on the Marshall Islands. The U.S. Army officially activates the 555th Parachute Infantry Company, the first airborne infantry unit in history composed entirely of African Americans. Expanded into the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion in 1944, it will be employed on smoke jumping duty, fighting forest fires in the Pacific Northwest.
