 Colby College is a private liberal arts college located on Mayflower Hill in Waterville, Maine, USA.  Founded in 1813, it is the 12th-oldest independent liberal arts college in the United States.  Colby was the first all-male college in New England to accept female students in 1871.http://www.colby.edu/about_cs/history.cfm Approximately 1,800 students from more than 60 countries are enrolled annually.  The college offers 54 major fields of study and 30 minors.  The 2015 annual ranking of U.S. News & World Report categorizes it as 'most selective' and rates it tied for the 15th best liberal arts college in the nation.http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges  In part because of Colby's location, more than two thirds of Colby students participate in study abroad programs.  Colby College competes in the NESCAC conference.  On February 27, 1813, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted a petition to establish the Maine Literary and Theological Institution, the 33rd chartered college in the United States.Mayflower Hill, A History of Colby College, Earl Smith, University Press of New England, 2006 The petition was led by Baptists who had come to the region for missionary work, and who wanted to train their own ministers, to end the reliance on England for providing men of learning. From 1816-1818, the new institution found a home in Waterville on 179 acres of land donated by citizens.  In 1818, trustees assigned the institution to Rev. Jeremiah Chaplin, a Baptist theologian.  Chaplin arrived in Waterville in the summer of 1818 with his family and seven students, including George Dana Boardman, the institution's first graduate.  They were put up in a vacant Waterville home, and in that home the first classes were held. After Maine separated from Massachusetts in 1820, the first Maine legislature affirmed the Massachusetts charter for the institution, but made significant changes.  Students could no longer be denied admission based on religion, the institution was prohibited from applying a religious test when selecting board members, and the trustees now had the authority to grant degrees.  A turning point, the Maine Literary and Theological Institution was renamed Waterville College on February 5, 1821.  In 1822, Elijah Parish Lovejoy, who would become a celebrated martyr to emancipation and to freedom of the press, graduated as valedictorian.  In 1825, the theological department was discontinued.  In 1828 the trustees decided to turn the somewhat informal preparatory department of the college into a separate school, to which was given the name Waterville Academy (most recently called the Coburn Classical Institute."Little Talks #749" Colby College Special Collections. December 31, 1967.  Accessed at http://web.colby.edu/specialcollections/2011/01/17/lt749-readonly/ In 1833, Rev. Rufus Babcock became Colby's second president, and students formed the nation’s first college-based anti-slavery society.http://www.colby.edu/education/activism/stories/antislavery.html  In 1845, the college's first Greek Society was formed, a chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon, which was followed by chapters of Zeta Psi in 1850 and Delta Upsilon in 1852.Colby College 1820-1925: An Account of Its Beginnings, Progress and Service, Edwin Carey Whittemore During the Civil War, many young men were called away from school to join the fight; from Waterville College, Richard C. Shannon, Henry C. Merriam, and Benjamin Butler.  Twenty-seven Waterville College students perished in the war, and more than 100 men from the town.  In the years following the war, as was the case at many American colleges, Waterville College was left with few students remaining to pay the bills and a depleted endowment.  Waterville College was on the verge of closing.    On August 9, 1865, a Boston merchant, prominent Baptist philanthropist and Maine native Gardner Colby attended Waterville College's commencement dinner, and unbeknownst to anyone in attendance except college president James Tift Champlin, announced a matching $50,000 donation that would allow the college to remain open.  On January 23, 1867, the college was renamed Colby University in gratitude.Colby College 1820-1925: An Account of Its Beginnings, Progress and Service, p 93, accessed at http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/colbiana_books/4/#b.mon.tag Now on solid financial footing and just 16 months after The Battle of Appomattox Court House, trustees of the college voted to construct a library and chapel to honor the Colby men who died in the war, making Memorial Hall the first Civil War memorial erected on a college campus.  The building began construction in the summer of 1867, and was dedicated at commencement in 1869.  At commencement in 1871, a Martin Milmore sculpture based on the Lion of Lucerne was added as the centerpiece of the building.  The lion was brought to Miller Library from Memorial Hall in January 1962."The Lion of Lucerne", Colby College Libraries, accessed: http://libguides.colby.edu/content.php?pid=240829 In the fall of 1871 Colby University was the first all-male college in New England to accept female students.  The national Sigma Kappa sorority was founded at Colby in 1874 by the college's first five female students.http://www.sigmakappa.org/about/default.asp?page=history  One of the buildings is named after the first woman to attend, Mary Caffrey Low, who was the valedictorian of the Class of 1875. In 1874, based on the success of its partnership with the Coburn Classical Institute, Colby created relationships with Hebron Academy and Houlton Academy (most recently known as Ricker College.The History Of Ricker, Ricker Alumni Association, accessed at: http://www.ricker.net/rickerh.htm  In 1893, the Higgins Classical Institute was also deeded to Colby - the last preparatory school that the university would acquire.History of the Baptists in Maine, by Henry Sweetser Burrage.  p 437, Marks Printing House, 1904  Students published the first issue of The Colby Echo in 1877. On January 25, 1899, Colby president Nathaniel Butler, Jr. '73, having come from the University of Chicago, renamed the "university" Colby College.Colby College 1820-1925: An Account of Its Beginnings, Progress and Service, p 129, accessed at http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/colbiana_books/4/#b.mon.tag  In 1920, Colby celebrated its centennial, marking not the date of the original charter, but the date of its charter from the new State of Maine in 1820. Franklin W. Johnson was appointed president of the college in June 1929.  That same year saw the public release of the Maine Higher Education Survey Report, which gave Colby's campus a less than desirable review.  Criticisms included a cramped location of just 28 acres located between the Kennebec River and the Maine Central Railroad Company tracks through Waterville, an aging physical plant, and proximity to the unpleasant odors of a pulp mill and the soot of the railroad.  Using the report as justification, President Johnson presented a proposal to move the college to a more adequate location to the Trustees on June 14, 1929.  The campaign to raise funds for the move was immediately complicated by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, and competing offers for the college's contemplated location emerged.The Man of Mayflower Hill: A Biography of Franklin W. Johnson, by Ernest C. Marriner, Colby College Press, 1968  Most notably, William H. Gannett offered a site in Augusta - a financially attractive option for the college, but a troublesome prospect for the town of Waterville.  Ultimately, a joint effort between Waterville citizens and the college raised more than $100,000 to purchase  near the outskirts of the city on Mayflower Hill, and the deed was presented to the college on April 12, 1931.Mayflower Hill: A History of Colby College, Earl H.

In 1951, the last class took place on the old campus in Coburn Hall.  In 1956, the Maine State Highway Commission diverted the proposed path of Interstate 95 to swing clear of the new campus to the west,http://digital.olivesoftware.com/Default/Skins/ColbyCollege/Client.asp?Skin=ColbyCollege&AppName=2&AW=1443640212710 and in 1961, Parade Magazine called the 24-mile section of I-95 from Augusta to Waterville "America's finest example of a 'driver's road' for scenery, speed, and safety.https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/50interstate2.cfm  Colby installed its first computer in 1975 - a DEC PDP-11/50 in the Lovejoy Building.The Strider Years, Marriner, Ernest Cummings (1980).

COLBY COLLEGE, 439 F.Supp. 631 (1977)  Of the case, President Strider commented that "Colby is prepared, as we have always tried to do, to comply with the law, but it would be helpful to know what the law is."

William D. Adams was the President of Colby from 2000-2014.  Major accomplishments included conducting the largest capital campaign in the history of Maine, which raised $376 million;http://bangordailynews.com/2013/01/09/news/mid-maine/colby-college-president-to-retire-next-year/ a new strategic plan for the college; accepting a major gift for the Colby College Museum of Art- the Lunder Collection of American Art - and the construction of a new wing for the museum to house it in 2013;http://www.colby.edu/administration_cs/president/upload/ColbyStratPlan.pdf and expansion onto the "Colby Green" with the construction of the 44,000 square-foot Diamond Building in 2007 and the 36,400 square-foot Davis Science Building in 2014.  Adam's final year was overshadowed by the controversial "renovation" of Miller Library, defended by Colby's Library Director Clem Guthro,http://www.thecolbyecho.com/opinion/a-response-to-students-and-faculty-defending-the-miller-renovations  in which a majority of the browsable collection was shipped to storage. Adam's policy unleashed an unprecedented protest from faculty, and made Colby the center of a national controversy that included the New York Public Library.Colby College Libraries Upon retirement, William D. Adams was appointed by President of the United States Barack Obama as Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities. On July 1, 2014, David A. Greene took office as the new president of the college.Called to Action, Colby Magazine, Summer 2014 Ed., accessed at: http://www.colby.edu/magazine/called-to-action/ Students choose from courses in 54 major fields and have wide flexibility in designing independent study programs, electing special majors, and participating in internships and study-abroad programs.
