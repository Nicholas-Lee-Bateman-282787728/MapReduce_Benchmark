They established a law firm with former New Jersey governor John Griggs spanning "varied interests in lumbering, manufacturing, transportation, and other enterprises that ranged from owning the Grosvenor Hotel in New York City to Arthur's legal counseling for the rising McGraw-Hill publishing empire." The Baldwins became acquainted with the seminary's president, Ezra Squier Tipple, who "welcomed the brothers to his prominent New York City Methodist Church when they came to Manhattan." Leonard Baldwin eventually became a trustee of the seminary in 1919. The donation originally consisted of $500,000 to build a college building, and $1,000,000 in the form of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P) stock.

Brothers College, later renamed as the "College of Liberal Arts", opened in September 1928 with its first class of 12 students. Brothers College would incorporate the women's program and become coeducational in 1942 during World War II when school officials recognized that the military draft and war effort would reduce the all-male student body. Drew offered admission to United States Navy personnel through the V-12 Navy College Training Program. Drew was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the program which offered students a path to a naval officers' commission.Herge, Henry C.

The university expanded its graduate education programs focusing in religious studies in 1955 with the establishment of the Graduate School, the third of Drew's degree-granting entities.  Four years later, it would expand the curriculum into other areas of the humanities.  The Graduate School was renamed as the "Caspersen School of Graduate Studies" after a pledge of $5,000,000 in 1999 by financier Finn M. W. Caspersen (1941–2009) and his wife (and Drew alumna) Dr. Barbara Morris Caspersen.Associated Press Staff. "Financier Finn Caspersen found dead" in Newsday (9 September 2009).

It allows first-year students to participate, with faculty who also serve as their academic advisers, in intensive study of a topic of hopefully mutual interest. Interdisciplinary study became a focus of the curriculum as well, with the creation of majors in behavioral studies, neuroscience and Russian Studies, and minors in such fields as American studies, arts administration and museology, business management, dance, public health and writing. In 1984, psychology professors Philip Jensen and Richard Detweiler led an effort to provide a personal computer and application software to all incoming freshman, a program referred to as the "Computer Initiative". Drew was the first liberal arts college to have such a requirement. The Computer Initiative differentiates Drew from other liberal arts colleges, and continues to this day.  As a result, Drew has considerably fewer public computing labs than comparable schools its size, utilizing the centrally-managed student laptops for instructional and general-purpose computing use.  After serving two-terms as New Jersey's 48th governor, Thomas Kean (b. 1935) was appointed as Drew's tenth president.  He would serve for 15 years before retiring in 2005. During his tenure, Kean continued his work in public service on several commissions, and was appointed as chairman of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States by George W. Bush in the wake of the September 11th attacks.National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. Thomas H.

Below is a list of key programs available to undergraduate students Graduate education has taken place at Drew University since 1912.  Initially, graduate education was limited to theology, and was conducted through the Theological School.  In 1955, the Graduate School was established to take responsibility for the academic study (i.e., non-ministerial) of religion at the graduate level, and allow for the development of new graduate programs.  In 1999, to honor the generous gift made by Barbara and Finn Caspersen, the school was renamed the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies. In 2006, the Graduate Division of Religion (GDR), which includes programs in biblical studies and early Christianity, historical studies, religion & society, and theological & philosophical studies, was moved from the Graduate School to the Theological School. The transition was made to reflect current trends in the academic study of religion. In 2006, the school created a Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) program, and in 2009, a Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) in Poetry program was established by Anne Marie Macari. The Graduate School currently offers the following 9 degrees:  Drew Theological School admitted its first students in 1867.  Until the 1950s, the school was known as the Drew Theological Seminary, and most students sought a Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.) degree, which was considered the standard for becoming a minister in an established church.  Occasionally, the seminary did issue other degrees, such a Master of Arts or a Doctor of Theology (Th.D.) to students engaged in the graduate study of religion. Starting in 1920 women were admitted as students, and most notably Olive Winchester was issued a Doctor of Theology in 1925, and became the first female ordained minister in Great Britain. The school is often noted for its strong ties to Korean Methodism. The Rev. Henry Appenzeller, a graduate of the Theological School, became the first Christian missionary to Korea. He worked to establish the Korean Methodist Church, schools and universities, and he translated the Bible into Korean. As a result of his work and his connection to Drew, the Theological School's matriculating class includes many students from South Korea. One of the 13 official seminaries of the United Methodist Church, the Theological School prepares those pursuing ministry in the United Methodist Church. The student body also includes students preparing for ministry in other Christian denominations, and those from other faith communities.
