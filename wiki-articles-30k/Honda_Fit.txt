 The Honda Fit, also marketed as the Honda Jazz, is a four-door, front-engine, front-wheel drive  subcompact car manufactured and marketed by Honda since 2001 and now in its third generation. Marketed worldwide and manufactured at ten plants in eight countries, sales have reached almost 5 million by mid 2013. Sharing Honda's global small car platform with the City, Airwave, Mobilio, Mobilio Spike, Freed and Freed Spike, the Fit is noted for its one-box or monospace with an interior packaging concept enabling a reconfigurable cargo volume competing with larger vehicles. Honda released hybrid gasoline-electric versions of the Fit in Japan in October 2010 and in Europe in early 2011. The Honda Fit EV, a limited production all-electric version, was released in the United States in July 2012 and in Japan the following month. The nameplate "Jazz" is used in Europe, Oceania, the Middle East, Africa, Australia and most parts of Asia, while the name "Fit" is used in Japan, China and the Americas. The Honda Fit debuted in June 2001 in Japan and immediately became a big hit. At its introduction in 2001, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award. By December 2001, it had outsold the Toyota Corolla, and ranked first in sales for nine out of twelve months in 2002. It subsequently was introduced in Europe (early 2002), Australia (late 2002), South America (early 2003), South Africa and South-East Asia (2003), China (Sep 2004), and Mexico (late 2005). The Fit's fuel tank under the front seat and compact rear suspension have enabled the rear seats to fold especially low, creating a flexible and regularized cargo volume that is large for its class. ::See: Honda Fit: diagram with forward fuel tank location and rear seat folded, into space typically occupied by the fuel tank. A production model for the United States and Canada debuted on January 8, 2006 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The car was released in Canada on April 3, 2006, and in the U.S. on April 20, 2006 as a 2007 model year car. In the North American markets, the first generation Fit was replaced after only two model years by a new 2009 model, which was released for Japan in November 2007 as a 2008 model. Subsequent iterations will maintain the same platforms worldwide. The Fit is sold in 6 variations whilst its City/Fit Aria sedan sibling is sold in 4 variations. All Fit/Jazz models throughout the world utilize these distinct codes. They are found in the vehicle’s identification number (VIN): Fit/Jazz Depending on the region, the Fit is available with a 1.2, 1.3 (in Europe referred as 1.4L model), 1.5-liter i-DSI engine, or 1.5-liter VTEC engine. All four engines are based on Honda’s L-series engine family. The eight-valve i-DSI (intelligent dual and sequential) engines use two spark plugs per cylinder, allowing gasoline to burn more completely; therefore, fuel consumption and emissions are reduced while maximum torque at mid-range rpm is maintained. The 1.5&nbsp;L VTEC engine has the typical 16-valve configuration that can maximize output at high rpm. Honda Fit's L-series of engines also provides the castings and reciprocating mass for Honda Marine’s 75 and  outboard motors, the BF75 and the BF90. The engines are mated to a five-speed manual, five-speed automatic, or continuously variable transmission (CVT), depending on the region (CVT not offered in United States). Two forms of the CVT are offered: the regular, and the CVT-7. The CVT-7 offers a smooth, continuous flow of power, or seven simulated "gears" controlled by paddle shifters on the steering column. The Fit uses Honda's Global Small Car platform, which is also used by the Fit Aria/City (a sedan version of the Fit), the Airwave (a station wagon version of the Fit Aria/City), the Mobilio, and the Mobilio Spike.  The Fit's central fuel tank location under the front rather than rear seats &mdash; combined with a compact, semi-independent, H-shaped torsion beam rear suspension &mdash; allows for a lower load platform and increased cargo volume.  Noted for its "class leading utilization of interior space and maximum flexibility for people or cargo," the Fit offered approximately twice the storage space behind its rear seat compared with the Toyota Yaris hatchback. Ultra Seat: The fuel tank and rear suspension layout also allows a multiple-mode seating system, marketed by Honda as Ultra Seat (Asia) and Magic Seat (North America, Oceania), with four seating modes &mdash; and a fifth in certain markets: According to the Fit's chief engineer, Kohei Hitomi, the Magic/Ultra seating system's design "came about after the design team had spent long hours watching people in supermarkets and how they stored their things." Ultra Luggage: In certain markets, Honda offers the Fit/Jazz without a spare tire, a system marketed as Ultra Luggage, where the spare tire well is used as part of a 'Tall' mode cargo area behind the rear seats.  A flexible flap allows three configurations of rear storage: Regular, Tall and Upper/Lower mode. The first generation Fit was produced at six locations, in Suzuka, Japan; Sumaré, Brazil; Guangzhou, China; Ayutthaya, Thailand; Karawang, Indonesia; and Laguna, Philippines. Models produced in Japan were for Honda's home market, Europe, some Asian markets, Australia (till the end of 2005), Canada and the United States. Models for the Malaysian, Singaporean and Vietnamese markets are produced in Thailand. The Brazilian factory supplied Mexico, all of Latin America and the Caribbean. Chinese models were sold in mainland China, and products from a dedicated export plant were exported to some left-hand-drive European markets, while Jazz models in Hong Kong were imported from Japan. The Fit is marketed in different ways and has different characteristics throughout the world, depending on which region it is sold in.  Two engines (1.3 i-DSI and 1.5 VTEC) were offered, each with a number of trim lines ranging from the basic "Y" to the sporty "S".  The 1.3&nbsp;L i-DSI was available with only the regular CVT automatic. The 1.5&nbsp;L VTEC model with the CVT-7 was added in September 2002. A five-speed manual was added in June 2004 for FWD model with the larger engine. Unique to the Japanese market, the Fit is also available in 4WD. Starting at a price of about JPY1,123,000 is the basic 1.3Y model. At the top of the range is the 1.5W four-wheel-drive version for JPY1,743,000. A bewildering range of options and accessories are available at most levels, including Honda's HDD GPS Navigation System called Internavi with its  color screen. This system incorporates TV and FM radio. In Japan, the Fit replaced the market segment previously served by the Honda Civic and shared a platform with the Honda City when the Civic no longer complied with Japanese Government dimension regulations when the Civic exceeded the 1700mm width dimension.  Like Japan, the European market also has two engines available. The European-only 1.2 i-DSI is offered as the base model in many countries, and can be purchased only with a five-speed manual transmission. The 1.4 i-DSI is identical to the 1,339&nbsp;cc 1.3 i-DSI sold in Japan, but marketed as a 1.4&nbsp;L to differentiate it from the smaller 1.2&nbsp;L engine (ironically, at 1,244&nbsp;cc, it is closer to 1.3&nbsp;L than the bigger one is to 1.4&nbsp;L). 1.4&nbsp;L models started out well-equipped with the 5-speed manual standard and the CVT-7 available as an option. All European models have ABS with disc brakes on the front wheels and drum brakes or disc brakes on the rear ones. Side airbags are standard on some high end models. The car has a good reputation in Europe with the UK's biggest automotive survey, performed by the motoring show Top Gear, revealing that the Honda Jazz was the second best vehicle on UK roads (after the Honda S2000), as voted by UK car owners in 2006. The popularity of the Jazz has made it Honda's best-selling model in the region, comprising 30% of all European Honda sales. Top Gear also went so far as to state that Honda Jazz (along with the Toyota Yaris) is the closest to reality car that money can buy, meaning that a Honda Jazz can cover the majority of the automotive needs that man has today. Local production and sale of the Fit (Hatchback) in China started in September 2004, roughly one year after the launch of the sedan version 'Fit saloon' (City/Fit Aria) in September 2003. The trims are similar to those in Japan; with the combination of 1.3 i-DSI, 1.5 VTEC, five-speed manual, and CVT, there are four models in total.  The Fit went on sale in the United States and Canada in April 2006 for model year 2007, replacing the Civic hatchback for North America and becoming that market's chief entry-level subcompact. The Civic continues to grow in size and price and was reclassified as a compact (larger than a subcompact) in 2011. In keeping with Honda's safety initiative, the Fit was offered in North America with power windows, standard side airbags, side-curtain airbags, and ABS, in addition to the mandatory front airbags. Due to differing safety regulations, North American Fits have larger bumpers, and a longer front clip, than the rest of the world, resulting in a slight increase in overall length. For the 2008 model, US models feature the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) to alert the driver of low pressure in any of the four stock wheels. Unlike some systems, the system in the 2008 Fit notifies the driver that a tire is low, but not which tire. The Fit narrowly missed qualifying for the Canadian government's $1,000 rebate, which is only offered for cars that meet the new federal fuel efficiency rating. Honda Canada Inc. decided to reimburse consumers the rebate for 2007, and a revision to the federal ratings allowed the 2008 Fit to qualify for the $1,000 rebate. The Fit was offered in two variants in the United States (Base and Sport), and three in Canada (DX, LX and Sport). Differences were primarily limited to cosmetics and standard equipment, since all models shared the same 1.5&nbsp;L 109&nbsp;hp (81&nbsp;kW) engine and standard five-speed manual transmission. A conventional five-speed automatic transmission was optional, instead of the CVT found throughout the rest of the world. The Fit Sport received paddle shifters mounted behind the steering-wheel when ordered with the automatic. For 2006, 27,934 Fits were sold in the United States. A total of 56,432 Fits were sold in the United States in 2007. The 2008 Honda Fit was largely unchanged from the 2007 with the exception of the TPMS and new windshield wipers that abandon the large rubber blade design to a more traditional rigid plastic with thin rubber blade design. MSRP was also increased by roughly US$100. Total sales in the United States for the year were 79,794, an increase of almost 41% over previous year. Reception Honda marketed the Fit as "Small is the New Big". Car and Driver magazine described that "[n]ot only is it endowed with an impressive array of standard features and an upscale interior, but its dynamics rival the responses of cars with much fancier pedigrees and price tags." The magazine even cited its lane-change number of 71.4&nbsp;mph edged the best run by a Ferrari F430 Spider F1 tested. And the car was included in Car and Driver's 10 Best Lists for three times. In May 2006, Fit was placed first in a Car and Driver comparison of seven economy cars that included Nissan Versa and Toyota Yaris.  Consumer Guide said in its review, "While prices seem steep for a subcompact (compared to the Toyota Yaris and Nissan Versa), this is one in name and exterior size only; it's really a small wagon that challenges some compact SUVs for room while getting significantly better fuel economy". Fit, sourced from Brazil, was launched in October 2005. Fit is currently (2014) made in Mexico. Honda started local production and sale of Fit in April 2003 when Brazil became the second production base, after Japan, for Fit. In Brazil, though initially was available with the 1.3 L i-DSI engine only, eventually the Fit has the same engines as the Japanese models (all Brazilian Honda cars have engines imported from Japan) and there are three trim levels available. Base model LX features the 1.35 i-DSI engine (which is marketed as 1.4 in Brazil) and driver side airbag. The second model in the range, the LXL, features the same engine from the LX, but adds some extra equipment: passenger side airbag and ABS. Top model EX has essentially the same equipment as the LXL, but comes with the 1.5 VTEC engine. All models are available with the five-speed manual or the regular CVT automatic. There are neither side airbags nor side curtains available for the Brazilian version. Also, the radio antenna is positioned differently, as it is near the front of the roof. Honda started selling the 2007 model in February 2006 with new bumpers and some cosmetic changes. Alcohol (ethanol) and gasoline hybrid Fit: Honda Brazil will start the sales in mid-December 2006 only for 1.35 i-DSI.  at 100% gasoline and  at 100% alcohol. It also works with any intermediary mix rate. There is an additional gasoline fuel tank on the right side under the triangle window for low temperature starts. This ensures a good start on cold days if the main tank has been filled with alcohol. Honda Fit was awarded by Quatro Rodas magazine as Best Buy in 2005 and 2006, and as the car with happiest buyers in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.  Launched in 2003, it was sold as the Jazz in South Africa. It is available with the 1.3 i-DSI (badged as a 1.4) or 1.5 VTEC engines both offered with either manual or CVT (automatic) transmission. All Honda Fits sold in Chile are built in Brazil, except for a few early 2004 models. Until 2007, all three Brazilian trim levels were available LX, LXL and EX, with five-speed manual or CVT automatic transmissions, but for 2008 models, the 1.5-liter 16-valve VTEC engine is no longer available, while the Brazilian LXL, with 1.35-liter 8-valve i-DSI engine, is sold as EX. No alcohol powered engines are available in Chile. The Jazz/Fit offering in Australia follows, to a degree, the Japanese versions (excluding the 4WD models), and was released in Australia in October 2002. The base model GLi is powered by a 1.34-litre i-DSI engine, and includes air-conditioning, a CD player, two front airbags, ABS brakes, EBD, a trip computer, remote central locking, a transponder coded immobilizer, power steering, windows and mirrors. Standard is a five-speed manual gearbox, with the CVT auto being an optional extra. The VTi adds the 1.5-litre VTEC engine, "sports" trim, and side mirror-mounted turning indicators. Optional is the 7-speed version of the CVT auto with Formula 1 inspired gear shift paddles on the steering wheel; the VTi-S has a "sports" body kit, fog lamps, and  alloy wheels. A "dot" on the "J" in Jazz on the rear of the first-generation model indicates whether it is powered by a 1.5 or 1.3-litre engine. The 1.5&nbsp;litre version (VTi) has a blue dot and 1.3-litre version (GLi) has a red dot. The second-generation models can be differentiated by the presence (VTi) or absence (GLi) of audio controls on the steering wheel. The body kit for the VTi-S has changed since its introduction in 2003. The picture to the right illustrates the differences. The white Jazz VTi-S in the middle is a December 2003 model, while the left silver Jazz is a 2004 VTi with optional bodykit, the right silver Jazz is a 2004 model VTi-S. Since its introduction to Australia, the Jazz has been imported from Japan. However, in late 2005, Honda Australia began importing the Jazz from Thailand. The cheaper production costs allowed Honda to make significant price cuts across the Jazz range, although the color range has been reduced to six (compared to 12 in Japan). In 2006, the Australian Honda Jazz received a few minor cosmetic facelift. At this stage a free trade agreement was established between Australia and Thailand which resulted all Australian Honda Jazz models being made from the Thailand factory. The model and trip variants remained the same excluding the cosmetic changes. All models were upgraded to LED tail lamps as standard and also the 1.3&nbsp;L Gli Jazz models have its antenna mounted at the front just above the front windscreen. The VTi 1.5&nbsp;L engine and body remained the same with the addition of a sports collapsible antenna mounting on the rear roof. The CVT paddle shift system was altered for easier use. The paddle system is down gears on the left and up gears on the right. The previous model had a shifter for both up down at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. The VTi-S is mechanically similar to the VTi but has a sports body kit. In addition, the LED tail lamps are smoked giving a more 'sporty' look. Fit/Jazz in Malaysia is available in two variants, the 1.5 i-DSI and 1.5 VTEC. Both of them are equipped with CVT-7 and having 2WD driving the front wheels. No manual transmission is offered. Unlike the Australian market which had different trims for the Jazz e.g. (GLi (Base Model with 1.3 motor), VTi (1.5 VTEC motor without Bodykit) and VTi-S (Sports Model with Bodykit)), the Malaysian Jazz models were either the 1.3 iDSi or the 1.5 VTEC. Choices now are 1.4 iDSi and 1.5 VTEC. The VTEC model is equipped with Honda Modulo Bodykit. Standard equipment on both models includes air-conditioning, driver and front passenger air-bags, CD/radio headunit, ABS brakes, EBD, trip computer, central locking, power-assisted windows, power-assisted side mirrors, power-assisted steering, reflector halogen headlamps and Ultra/Magic folding seats. Optional extras can be purchased from Honda Dealers/Service Centers all around Malaysia at retail price. A three-year warranty is standard for all Jazz models purchased from authorized Honda dealers in Malaysia. Initially the Jazz was sold as a CBU model (fully imported from Japan). The variants included the 1.3 iDSi and the 1.5 VTEC model. Subsequently Malaysia received units that were built in Thailand. The main and most noticeable difference were rear disc brakes. Japanese models incorporated rear drum brakes. Early 2006 saw the facelift of the Jazz (which was introduced earlier in Japan). The facelifted version included new front fascia and bumpers, new rear bumper, new side skirts, side mirror mounted indicators/turn signals, rear LED brake lights, rear LED third brake light, body colored housing headlamps and minor interior changes. The motor remains unchanged. Sold as the Jazz in Singapore by the authorised dealer and Fit by parallel importers. 1.5L i-DSI variant is offered for the Jazz while the Fit sold by parallel importers is available in 1.3L only. CVT or five-speed manual transmissions are offered in Singapore. Introduced in November 2003 for local production and sold as the Jazz in Thailand. Thailand became the third production base to produce Fit, after Japan and Brazil. Initially it was available only with a 1.5 L i-DSI engine which was shared with City (Fit Aria), five-speed manual transmission or CVT. It is available in two variants, the 1.5 i-DSI and 1.5 VTEC. Both of them are FF layout with CVT-7 or five-speed manual transmission offered. Jazz's Engine Figures The Jazz was first imported from Japan under the name Fit in 2002, but due to the high price it was not very popular. In late 2003, Honda decided to import the Fit from Thailand, badged as the Jazz, to Indonesia at a much lower price. After the release, the Jazz was an instant success and became the best-selling car in Indonesia after the Toyota Innova, Toyota Avanza and Daihatsu Xenia. It was offered in only one trim with the 1.5 i-DSI engine mated to either a 5-speed manual or a CVT transmission. In early 2005, a VTEC model was offered with added rear disc brakes, ABS, EBD and airbags. Since 2005, all Jazz models were built at Honda's Karawang factory. Sold as the Jazz in the Philippines from 2004 up to 2008 (1st generation). It is available with three trim lines: and 2 engine configurations: 2004 models were imported from Thailand, while 2005–2008 models were built in Honda's plant in Laguna. 2007 Honda Fit NHSTA crash scores: Europe NCAP tested on 2004 Honda Jazz 1.4 SE (RHD) model: Honda Jazz became the supermini to have the best overall performance for combined safety in its class.  The second generation Fit debuted on 17 October 2007 at the Tokyo Motor Show. At its introduction in 2007, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award for the second time. The vehicle offers a longer wheelbase than its predecessor and is wider and longer overall. Overall height is unchanged, while interior height increased by .3&nbsp;in. Multi-mode seating and cargo configurations are retained, with redesigned headrests enabling more convenient folding of the rear seats. The cabin features greater interior volume, and boot capacity decreased from 21.3 to .  North America models are slightly longer, due to a longer fascia; the difference is visible in photos below.    Two engines are offered in the new Fit. A  i-VTEC produces  at 6,000&nbsp;rpm and  at 4,500&nbsp;rpm. This engine is offered in both European and Asian markets. A  i-VTEC engine is also offered and produces a maximum output of  at 6,600 rpm and  at 4,800 rpm. This is the only engine available in the American market. A five-speed manual, five-speed automatic (4WD only) and CVT transmission are available. The chassis was re-engineered, with structural rigidity increased by 164 percent over the first generation Fit.  The Fit now features improved ride and handling. Sales of the Fit Hybrid began in Japan in October 2010. The hybrid version starts at  million (around ), the lowest price for a gasoline-hybrid electric vehicle sold in Japan. The Fit Hybrid features a 1.3-litre engine and electric motor, with an estimated fuel economy of  measured in accordance with Japanese 10–15 cycle. The car uses a parallel hybrid system that works in tandem with the gasoline engine. The parallel hybrid system is simple and lightweight while enhancing driving performance and fuel economy. The European version, called Jazz Hybrid, was unveiled at the 2010 Paris Motor Show and became available in early 2011. The Honda Fit/Jazz for the European and Japanese markets features revised headlamps, new front grille, a leather seating option and a new Lime Green exterior color choice. Fuel economy estimated in accordance with European standard is around  and CO2 emissions of 104&nbsp;g/km. It has the lowest carbon emission of automatic car in the B-segment. When the car is driven in a low and steady speed, the car switches to EV mode and releases no carbon emission: the engine shuts down and the car is powered solely by the electric motor. A compact Intelligent Power Unit (IPU) is located under the rear cargo area, the Jazz Hybrid maintains the same fully adjustable seating configuration as the gasoline-powered model and the same spacious area for optimum utilization and storage. With the fuel tank placed in the center plus an ultra-thin electric motor and compact IPU, it claims to achieve an efficient weight distribution. In an interview, Kohei Hitomi, the project leader of Fit hybrid, admitted that to bring CO2 further down will affect some attributes that buyers of the car most value: bigger electric motor and battery will sacrifice space utility;  improving aerodynamics might make side mirrors smaller. He said there are benefits for customers to keep all the versatility. The drivetrain is the same drive system as the Honda Insight. The advantages of the system are low cost, low weight and that it can be combined with either manual transmission or continuous variable transmission. The car is better suited than its diesel competitors in areas where superminis are most common: city centres. It is more economical in urban conditions. Thanks to the instant torque of the electric motor, it has a much better engine response. The hybrid version is not available in the U.S. According to Koichi Kondo, Executive Vice President of Honda: “As for the future, it's open to question. We will carefully be watching the market situation.” Hitomi, as reported by Automotive News, believes that the current Fit offered in North American market has very good fuel mileage as it is and questions if buyers are willing to pay extra for marginal mileage gains.  It is reported about 86,000 Fit Hybrid are sold in 2011. In Malaysia, the Fit hybrid is called Jazz hybrid. Honda introduced the hybrid model to Malaysia in March 2012. Honda will produce the Jazz hybrid in Malaysia by the end of 2012. Honda was the largest hybrid vehicle seller in Malaysia in 2011 and Malaysia is currently Honda’s largest hybrid vehicle market in Southeast Asia. It is reported that Honda will introduce the Fit hybrid to China within 2012. The Jazz hybrid is launched in Thailand in July 2012, the first hybrid in the country's sub-compact market. First time buyers of the car are eligible for Thai government's first car tax rebate. The hybrid model is assembled in Thailand. New model of Fit Hybrid was launched in Japan in 2013. It is equipped with Honda’s next-generation sport hybrid i-DCD system that combines a 97 kW (130 hp), 156 N·m (115 lb·ft) 1.5-liter direct injection engine combined with a 22 kW (30 hp) 160 N·m (118 lb·ft) Honda H1 motor. Powertrains are shared with Honda Vezel and Honda Grace Hybrid.   The Fit Shuttle is a compact station wagon derived from the second generation Fit and is available in Japan's domestic market. The Shuttle is also a successor to the station wagon variant of first generation Fit, sold as the Airwave. The car leverages the efficient packaging of Fit and Fit hybrid. The launch of the car in June 2011 was pushed back from March as a result of the quake and tsunami in Japan on March 11, 2011. Production of the car was transferred from Honda's Sayama plant in Saitama Prefecture to Suzuka plant in Mie Prefecture as a result of power rationing after the quake. Production began in early May 2011. The Fit Shuttle was shortlisted for Car of The Year Japan 2012. Its drivetrains are shared with the Fit. The Fit Shuttle has a 1.5 L i-VTEC engine with , which is optional in Japan's Fit. A hybrid version, the Fit Shuttle hybrid, is also available, with a 1.3 L i-VTEC engine with IMA. Continuously variable transmission is the only transmission available for FWD models. A five-speed auto transmission is standard on four-wheel-drive models. The fuel efficiency of the station wagon and its hybrid variant was enhanced to be the same as that of Fit and Fit hybrid by reducing engine friction, front brake rolling resistance, improvement in aerodynamics and improvement of control efficiency of the hybrid system. All models feature ECON Mode for enhancing real-world fuel economy. Hybrid model has Eco Assist (Ecological Drive Assist System) to help the driver engage in fuel-efficient driving practices. It went on sale on June 16, 2011, in Japan. The Fit Shuttle comes with a double-hinged two-piece load floor that both allows access to an under-floor storage bin and also functions as a divider for the cargo area. Through better sound dampening and insulation, the Fit Shuttle is pledged to be as quiet as a mid-size sedan. Japanese sales began in October 2007. Facelifted models, and the hybrid version, arrived in October 2010. Models available in Japan are the 1.3&nbsp;L and 1.5&nbsp;L variants consisting of the 13G, 15XH and the top-of-the-line RS. In 2007, aftermarket tuner Mugen, introduced a new line of accessories for the Japanese market 2008 Honda Fit. On 17 January 2008, they introduced the Mugen Fit F154SC at the 2008 Tokyo Auto Salon. The F154SC has a supercharger installed onto the stock L15A engine that raises base horsepower of the  I4 to  and . Other upgrades include full coilover suspension, exhaust, intake, and brakes. Body modifications include a widen track to feed more air into the engine bay. Although the second generation Honda Fit was introduced in the Japanese market in 2007, the first generation Fit was still sold in the North American market for the 2008 model year. The second generation Fit for the North American market was unveiled on 19 March 2008, at the 2008 New York International Auto Show for the 2009 model year. The North American Fit's front overhang is several inches longer to improve U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test ratings. The engine is a  i-VTEC 4-cylinder with 117 horsepower at 6600&nbsp;rpm mated to a five-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic transmission. The second generation Honda Fit went on sale in North America around August 26, 2008, for the 2009 model year.  It was considered the most expensive within the subcompact class when equipped as such, but was also described as modestly priced. It was reported in September 2009 that Honda is considering producing the Fit in North America in response to the increasing strength of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. For the 2011 models, Vehicle Stability Assist, cruise control, remote entry and USB audio interface became standard across all trim levels. In addition, the Fit Sport now comes with carpeted floor mats. As of the 2011 model year, the base Fit comes with a remote entry, 15-inch wheels with covers, power windows, power locks, cruise control, a tilt and telescoping steering wheel, a 160-watt AM/FM/CD audio system with four speakers, a USB audio interface, a 12-volt power outlet, and other features. The Fit Sport adds a ground appearance package,  alloy wheels, paddle shifters, a navigation system, a security system, fog lights, chrome exhaust finisher, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, steering wheel-mounted audio controls, floor mats, a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system, and other features. For 2012, the Fit features revised floor, front fenders, A-pillars, and front corner-window glass. The Fit Sport features a revised grille, dark "machined surface" finish alloy wheels, a black monochrome theme interior with chrome accents. The base model receives body-color exterior mirrors (previously black), standard security system and new wheel covers for 2012. Canadian trims include the DX (two speakers, black door handles and side mirrors), DX-A (adds factory-installed air conditioning), LX (adds among other things, body-colored door handles and side mirrors, 15-inch lightweight alloy wheels from the 2006–2011 Civic Hybrid and DX-G, rear spoiler, power locks and remote entry, two speakers for a total of four, cruise control), and Fit Sport (adds USB jack and Vehicle Stability Assist). The Fit Sport is similar to its American counterpart, however a navigation system is not offered as an option. There are plans to build subcompact cars, which many rumoured to be Fit, in Honda's new plant in Mexico. NHTSA Crash Test Ratings: Frontal Driver and Passenger:  Side Driver Impact:  Side Rear Passenger Impact:  Rollover:  The Sumare-built new Fit was introduced in October 2008 in Brazil at the Sao Paulo Auto Show. There are four versions: LX and LXL, with the 1.35-liter (marketed as 1.4) 16V engine, and EX and EXL, with the 1.5-liter 16V engine. Both engines have VTEC and flex fuel capabilities as standard. Manual and automatic – both five-speed – gearboxes are offered; CVT is no longer available. The Jazz is sold in Malaysia currently in one variant. It comes with a 1.5&nbsp;L i-VTEC engine with an automatic gearbox. Only available in S variant, it comes in a blue-black upholstery interior trim, 4-speaker CD/MP3/WMA player with USB and AUX jack, immobiliser and 4 Corner Reverse Sensors. It retails at an estimated . The 2008 Fit is available from parallel importers and the authorised dealer in Singapore.

Jazz in Thailand gets a facelift in January 2011 with new front grille and rear bumper, sees an addition of front dual airbags across the range and front fog lamps in SV models. In early 2012 Thai government allowed to import Jazz (and Accord) from Japan to serve buyers in Thailand without exercise tax, due to the flood in Honda plant in Ayudhaya province; the Japan spec Fit came with HID headlamps and 6 airbags. The Jazz hybrid was launched in Thailand in July 2012, the first hybrid in the country's sub-compact market. First time buyers of the car are eligible for Thai government's first car tax rebate.

Honda expects the launch of Next-Gen Jazz in India sometime during the next fiscal in 2015.  The second generation Fit (sold as the Jazz) is available in Australia, albeit initially without electronic stability control (known as Vehicle Stability Control in Honda nomenclature). Honda introduced the feature at the end of 2010. Stability Control has since become standard on all Jazzes sold. Until the end of 2011 the Australian Jazz was sourced from Thailand. However, due to the 2011 flooding in Thailand, Honda Australia sourced two special editions of Jazz from Japan from early 2012 until Honda's plant in Thailand resumed production. The Japan-produced Vibe and Vibe S replaced the existing GLi and VTi prefixed models.  On July 28, 2008, Honda UK announced that the second generation Jazz would be on sale from October 17, 2008. The new model will be sold with two new engine variants; a 90 PS 1.2-litre i-VTEC petrol capable of  (combined) and with low CO2 emissions of 120&nbsp;g/km; and a 100 PS 1.4-litre i-VTEC petrol engine capable of  (combined) and with similarly low CO2 emissions of 123&nbsp;g/km. Honda also announced the introduction of an optional new "I-SHIFT" semi-automatic gearbox replacing the traditional automatic CVT gearbox that had been available on the previous model. Production of the Jazz for European markets moved from Japan to Honda's UK plant in Swindon on 7 October 2009. Facelifted models and the new hybrid model went on sale on 1 February 2011. Aerodynamics improvement help the Cd drop from 0.336 to 0.330. Engine modifications result in a drop of carbon emission of two grams to 123&nbsp;g/km for 1.2&nbsp;L engine and 126&nbsp;g/km for 1.4&nbsp;L engine respectively. CVT transmission will also be available on cars with the larger engine. The third generation Fit retains the overall design concept of previous generations, notably the center-located fuel tank and multi-configuration interior concept, marketed as Magic Seating. The redesigned bodywork features styling with distinctive bodyside cut-in swage lines; a new platform employing ultra-high strength 780 MPa yield steel for 27% of its bodywork &mdash; and a shorter overall length (-1.6 inches), longer wheelbase (+1.2inch) increased rear legroom (+4.8 inches) and increased passenger volume (+4.9 cu ft) compared to its previous generation. Body panels are both welded and bolted to the frame in a hybrid monocoque and spaceframe fusion &mdash; and rear torsion beam suspension is more compact, no longer using an anti-sway bar to maximize interior and cargo space.  The HR-V shares its platform with the Fit. Japan models went on sale in September 6, 2013. Models available in Japan range from the 13G, 15X, RS and hybrid. The Fit Hybrid uses an Earth Dreams 1.5-liter Atkinson cycle DOHC i-VTEC engine paired with a 7-speed DCT (dual-clutch transmission) and an internal high-output motor, IPU (Intelligent Power Unit) with lithium-ion battery, electric servo braking system with variable servo ratio control.

By December 2001, it had outsold the Toyota Corolla, and ranked first in sales for nine out of twelve months in 2002. With a total sales of 250,790 for the year of 2002, it became the best-selling vehicle in Japan, which is a first for a Honda model. By September 2003, a little more than two years after the car was first sold, Fit reached 500,000 sales in Japanese market. After a minor model change that went on sale on June 11, 2004, Honda announced that, in about 2 weeks' period after its introduction, the company received orders from customers totaled around 13,000 units. By November 2007, in less than 6 months after minor model change, cumulative sales of Fit reached one million units in Japan. The second generation has been the top selling car in Japan since its official launch in November 2007. By September 2010, cumulative sales in Japan reached 1.5 million units. By December 2004, cumulative global sales of Fit/Jazz reached 1 million units. On 17 July 2007, Honda announced that as of the end of June more than 2 million Fit/Jazz units had been sold worldwide since its introduction. Japan accounts for the largest percentage of sales, with 962,000 units sold in the home market. Europe is next with 417,000 units. The U.S. accounts for 77,000 cars since introduction in 2006. Honda expected to sell 33,000 vehicles in the U.S. for the 2007 model year, but exceeded these expectations and sold 40,000. Honda plans to put 70,000 Fits on the U.S. roads for the 2008 model year. In the first half of 2008, Honda and other manufacturers were surprised by the rapid shift towards smaller cars in the United States. Sales of Fit during the first five months of the year jumped 64% compared with that of 2007. Production of 2009 Fit for the United States market was to increase from 60,000 to 80,000 cars. Further increase in supply for the United States market is limited by Honda's production capacity of 500,000 a year for all markets. Honda announced that by the end of July 2009, worldwide sales of Fit/Jazz reached 3 million. One year later, global cumulative sales reached 3.5 million units in July 2010. In April 2006, Honda Australia started promoting the Honda Jazz with Village Green, an animated television commercial, in 30 second and 60 second versions. The 60 second ad was inspired by Thomas the Tank Engine. The campaign was developed by Foote Cone Belding Melbourne, by creative director/art director Scott Lambert, copywriter Mark Ringer and agency producer Mandi Wright. The animated ad was directed by Michael Cusack at Anifex, with director of photography/producer Richard Chataway. In April 2006, American Honda and its ad agency RPA launched the all-new small car, the Honda Fit, with six five-second and two 30-second TV ads, with the slogan 'The Fit Is Go'. These ads ran only briefly as demand quickly outstripped supply. In September 2008, RPA (Rubin Postaer and Associates) announced it had started a national advertising campaign for Honda Fit, beginning September 29. The list of ads include "Mecha-Mosquitoes," (broke 9/21) "Defense Mechanism" (breaks 10/2) and "Bats" (breaks 9/28), produced by Digital Domain. As part of the campaign, the vehicle also appeared in Gossip Girl, 90210, America’s Next Top Model, Smallville and Everybody Hates Chris. Print ads "Gas Hogs" and "Cavernous" will be featured in popular magazines. A dedicated marketing site was built to communicate top product features through games and interactive experiences. The campaign continued the 'The Fit Is Go' slogan.  In January 2010, Honda announced a recall of 646,000 Fit hatchbacks from 2002 to 2008 due to a window switch that could catch fire. The recall, which affected Fit/Jazz models, including about 170,000 Jazz compact cars in the United Kingdom, was conducted as Honda had received reports of master window switch malfunctions on the driver’s door, most commonly occurring when the driver's window is left open, allowing rain or water to drip into the window switch module, resulting in switch failure and in occasions overheating, eventually possible fire hazards. To address the issue, recalled cars will be fitted with a waterproof skirt to prevent further water entry. Honda will also be replacing malfunctioning and worn-off window switches. Honda offers the change of affected parts free of charge. On February 18, 2011, Honda's Philippines affiliate called an emergency press conference to announce a voluntary safety recall of its two sub-compact models Jazz and City, explaining that small engine components in the models could create problems and stall their engine. Four pieces of the lost-motion-spring retainers in the cylinder head of the 1.5-liter Honda Jazz (distributed from September 2008 to April 2010) and the 1.5-liter Honda City (distributed from January 2009 to April 2010) had to be replaced right away. The Honda Jazz subject of recall was imported from Thailand while the City is a complete knock-down unit assembled in the Philippines. The recall targets 5,468 units of both distributed at the time. Also, no crashes or injuries were reported. The 2009–2011 U.S. version of Honda Fit is subject to the same recall as the Philippine version. In 2015 the US and Canadian arm of Honda issued a recall for 2015 Honda Fits for a problem with the way that its' software controls the CVT. The system uses high hydraulic pressure in the transmission at times, which can put stress on the drive pulley shaft. Also, some of those parts "may have been produced at the low end of the hardness specification" during manufacturing, Honda reported.  When the two factors are combined over time, the high pressure could cause the shaft to break. If this happens, it would result in losing drive to the front wheels or in them locking up.http://www.autoblog.com/2015/10/02/honda-recall-143k-civic-fit-cvt/  The Honda Fit EV concept electric car has its global debut in the 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show. The concept uses a motor derived from the FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel cell vehicle that, in sport mode, gives the driving feel of a car with a 2-liter gasoline/petrol engine. The vehicle is paired with an exclusive interactive key fob that enable the driver to view the battery's state of charge, initiate charging, and activate the vehicle's climate control all without a cell-phone or an Internet connection. The vehicle can also pair with mobile app and web site that allows drivers to set the vehicle's charging schedule for the best utility rates, locates charging stations and provides 24/7 roadside assistance. Honda started the Electric Vehicle Testing Program in the cities of Saitama, Kumagaya and Chichibu, Saitama Prefecture, and Amakusa area, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, for its next-generation personal mobility products, including Fit EV in December 2010. A demonstration program with pre-production vehicles began in Guangzhou, China in early November 2011. Another program, called Honda Electric Vehicle Demonstration Program, is taking place in California, in partnership with Stanford University, the city of Torrance and Google. See the Press Release for details about the Advanced Technology Demonstration Program in the USA. The electric vehicle joins Google's GFleet, a car-sharing service for employees. Stanford uses the electric vehicle to study differences in the psychological and physical reaction of using battery-electric vehicles and driving a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle. The first 2013 Fit EV demonstrator was delivered to the city of Torrance in January 2012. Stanford and Google received their demonstrators in February 2012. See details in Honda Press Release.  The production 2013 model year Fit EV was unveiled at the November 2011 Los Angeles Show. Vehicles for the U.S. market were limited to only 1,100 units through October 2014. Honda began deliveries of the Fit EV in the United States in July 2012, and the car was available only through leasing initially at a price of  per month for 3 years, based on base price of , and later the monthly lease payment was reduced to  for all customers effective from June 2013. Initial availability was limited to California and Oregon, and sales were scheduled to begin in selected markets in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, New York, and New Jersey by late February 2013. Certified dealers for Fit EV increased from 36 to 200 by the middle of 2013.  The Fit EV was released through leasing to local government and corporate customers in Japan in August 2012. Availability in Japan was limited to 200 units during its first two years. The car is based on the Fit compact car platform, powered by a lithium-ion battery pack combined with an AC synchronous, permanent magnet coaxial traction motor and low-friction reduction gearbox borrowed from the Honda FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. Honda said the Fit EV concept had an all-electric range of  and a top speed of . Honda also said that recharging the Fit EV will take 12 hours from a 120-volt outlet and three hours with a 240-volt supply.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency official range is  and the agency rated the Fit EV combined fuel economy at 118 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (), at the time, the highest of any electric car available in the U.S. market, topping the Mitsubishi i MiEV, rated with a combined 112 MPGe (). The Fit EV was surpassed in December 2012 by the Scion iQ EV, with a rating of 121 MPGe combined. Energy consumption is 29&nbsp;kW·h per 100 miles, and the fuel economy rating for city driving is 132 MPGe () and 105 MPGe () for highway.  Under the Japanese JC08 test, the Fit EV achieved the current best AC energy consumption rate of 106 Wh/km and a range of . The Fit EV employs Toshiba's SCiB batteries that can be recharged to 80% capacity in 15 minutes and can be recharged up to 4,000 times, more than 2.5 times that of other Li-ion batteries. The battery cells use lithium titanate oxide in the anode, providing rapid charge times and extending battery life. It also provides stable discharge from extremely cold (-30&nbsp;°C) to high temperature above 40&nbsp;°C. According to Honda, the SCiB battery can charge in about half the time of a typical Li-ion battery. The Honda Fit EV, like the Honda CR-Z hybrid, will have three distinct driving modes: econ, normal, and sport. Honda explained that "econ" mode will extend the driving range by 17% compared to the normal mode; in sport mode, the Fit EV imitates the acceleration of a small car with a 2.0-liter gasoline engine. The production version is equipped with a 20 kWh lithium-ion battery and 92 kW coaxial electric motor. The new electric motor is up to 98 percent efficient, contrast to the typical 15 percent efficiency of a gasoline engine. Honda estimates the Fit EV range at  for city driving, and  for combined city and highway. The battery can be recharged in three hours from a 240-volt outlet. In July 2014 Honda announced the end of production of the Fit EV for the 2015 model, together with the Honda Insight hybrid and the Honda FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel-cell car. A total of 1,070 new units were leased in the U.S. through April 2015. See the section: December 2012 Plug-in Electric Car Sales Numbers Only 1 Honda Fit EV was leased during the first four months of 2015. In March 2015 Honda offered a two-year lease extension to existing lessees, and also to new customers on used cars, at a reduced priced of  a month with no down payment. In both cases there is no purchase option at the end of the lease. The Honda Fit was one of the cars listed as eligible for the SCCA World Challenge's touring car B-spec class for the 2012 season onward.      Category !!
