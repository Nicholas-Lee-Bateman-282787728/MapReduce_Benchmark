    The National Lacrosse League (NLL) is a men's professional box lacrosse league in North America. It currently has 9 teams with 5 in the United States and 4 in Canada. Unlike other lacrosse leagues which play in the summer, the NLL plays its games in the winter and spring. Each year, the playoff teams battle for the Champion's Cup. The NLL has averaged between 9,400 and 10,700 spectators per game each year since 2004.NLL Sees Lowest Attendance Avg. Since '03 Season; Rochester Up Nearly 15%, Sports Business Daily, May 10, 2012   The version of lacrosse played in the NLL is "box lacrosse" otherwise known as "indoor lacrosse". The NLL plays four 15-minute quarters with 2-minute breaks between the 1st and 2nd quarters and between the 3rd and 4th quarters (with a 12-minute break between the 2nd and 3rd quarters referred to as "half-time"). The clock does not run when play is stopped. The team that has scored the most goals at the end of regulation time is declared the winner. If a game is tied after regulation, the two teams play sudden death overtime periods of up to 15 minutes each where the next team to score wins the game. Each team dresses 18 players of whom 2 are goaltenders; the remaining 16 are called "runners". Each team in the NLL plays 18 games during the regular season, 9 at home and 9 away. The teams are divided into 2 divisions: the East Division and the West Division. Each team plays at least 12 of its 18 regular season games against division opponents. The regular season begins in late December and ends in April. At the end the regular season, the top 3 teams in each of the East Division and West Division make the playoffs to compete for the Champion's Cup. The 2 regular season division champions earn a first-round bye as top seeds. The 2nd seed hosts the 3rd seed in their respective division for the single-game elimination Division Semifinal in the 1st round. In 2014, the Division Finals and Championship expanded to a 2-game series from the previous single-game elimination setup. The top seed from each division played the winner of the Division Semifinal game between the 2nd and 3rd seeds with the lower-seeded team hosting the first game and the higher seed hosting the second game of the series. Whoever won both games would win the 2-game series. In the event of a series split with both teams winning one game, a 10-minute mini-game period would be played; if still tied, 10-minute overtime periods thereafter. The mini-game was played immediately following the conclusion of the second contest to determine the winner of the playoff series. In 2015, the playoff format changed once again, expanding the Finals to a best-of-3 series. The first two playoff rounds remained the same, with the Division Semi-finals as a single-game elimination, and the Division Finals as a best-of-2 plus a tie-breaking mini-game if necessary. All NLL games are played on weekends, save for the occasional Friday night game.During the 2007 season, 3 games were held on Thursday nights, the most since the 2003 season. Most NLL players have full-time jobs off the floor; notable examples include Toronto's Dan Ladouceur, a Durham Region police officer, and Buffalo's John Tavares, a high school teacher in Mississauga, Ontario. The rebirth of major professional box lacrosse in the United States came on March 13, 1986, with the formation of the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League (EPBLL), which was incorporated by Russ Cline and Chris Fritz. Previously, in 1985 box lacrosse sponsored an event played at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The USA/Canada Superseries was an 8-game series seen as a precursor to the Major Indoor Lacrosse League. The league opened play for the 1987 season with the 2 games on January 10, 1987: the Philadelphia Wings at the New Jersey Saints (Philadelphia defeating New Jersey by 11–8) and the Baltimore Thunder at the Washington Wave. Darrell Russell was named Commissioner of the league. The 4 teams contested a 6-game regular season before a postseason which saw all 4 teams qualify for a single knockout tournament which ended with the Baltimore Thunder being crowned as the EPBLL's first champion in 1987. Coached by Bob Griebe, the Baltimore Thunder defeated the Washington Wave by a score of 11–10 to capture the league's first championship. The league announced that a total of 124,536 fans attended Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League games in its first season. Those same 4 teams played in the second season of the EPBLL. The teams expanded to an 8-game schedule, and set up a 3-team playoff with the regular season winner claiming a bye to the title game. The league began its second season with each of the 4 teams playing an 8-game schedule. The league became known as the Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL). The New Jersey Saints became the second league champions by defeating the Washington Wave, 17–16 before 8,125 fans at the Capital Centre. For the Wave, it was the second time in as many years they reached the championship game, only to come away on the short end of a one-goal game. The league then announced that the Saints would relocate to the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island beginning in the 1989 season. The team name was changed to the New York Saints to reflect their new home. The MILL announced that it would award expansion teams to Detroit, Michigan, and Boston, Massachusetts. The teams began play in the 1989 season. The Detroit team was named the Turbos, and began play in the Joe Louis Arena. Their team colors were announced to be purple, silver and black. The Boston entry was called the New England Blazers and they played their home games at the Worcester Centrum. The Blazers used green, orange, and white as their team colors. The league prepared to open its third season with 6 teams: the Baltimore Thunder, the Detroit Turbos, the New England Blazers, the New York Saints, the Philadelphia Wings, and the Washington Wave. Each of the 6 teams played an 8-game schedule in 1989, with an even 4 home and road games. In its first ever regular season game, 12,171 Detroit fans watched the expansion Turbos defeat the Washington Wave, 11–9, in the debut of the 1989 season. As the season went on, regular season attendance figures for the league totaled at 230,724 for 24 regular season games, which made an average of 9,614 people in the stands per game. When adding the postseason, the numbers grew to 255,088 total and an average of 9,811 a game. Later that year, the Philadelphia Wings captured the league championship in front of a record postseason crowd of 16,042 at the Spectrum, defeating the New York Saints, 11–10. After the championship game, the league announced the expansion into Pittsburgh, a team later to be called the Bulls, who played at the Civic Arena, sporting the traditional Pittsburgh colors of black and gold, like the Steelers. In 1990, the MILL prepared to open its fourth season with 6 teams: the Baltimore Thunder, Detroit Turbos, New England Blazers, New York Saints, Philadelphia Wings, and Pittsburgh Bulls. Each of the 6 teams played an 8-game schedule over the 1990 season. During the near of the end of the season, the New York Saints defeated the Philadelphia Wings, 8–5, before the first sellout and largest crowd in league history: 17,177 at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The Saints' victory forced a rematch the next week in the playoffs. However, the Wings won that game, and later went on to become the first team to win 2 league championship games, defeating the New England Blazers, 17–7 in front of 11,479 fans. The Major Indoor Lacrosse League later announced that the attendance for 26 total games during the season was 287,585 which was a huge boost, increasing the average attendance a game to 11,060. After the season, the MILL announced the signing of twin brothers, Paul Gait and Gary Gait, 3-time All-Americans at Syracuse to the Detroit Turbos after being drafted (the two brothers won national championships with the Syracuse Orange in 1988, 1989, and 1990). The league prepared to open season 5 with the same 6 teams. However, this season schedule increased from 8 to 10 games with each team playing 5 games at home and 5 games on the road. In the first game of the regular season, the debut of Detroit rookie twin brothers Paul and Gary Gait was successful, as they paced the Turbos to a 20–16 victory over the Baltimore Thunder. The 1991 season was definitely a record-breaking year, especially in Detroit. Rookie twin Turbos, Paul and Gary Gait, set new standards in most offensive categories. Paul scored a record 47 goals, while Gary was second in the league with 32. Gary established new records with 36 assists and 68 points. As a team, Detroit set records for goals scored with 184, assists with 227, and total points with 411. The Detroit Turbos defeated the Baltimore Thunder, 14–12, to claim the league's fifth title and the Turbos' first title. The World Championship Game was attended by 10,814 at the Baltimore Arena. The league announced that Buffalo had been named as an expansion team for league play in the 1992 season. The team was named the Bandits, wearing the colors black, orange, and white, and had their home in Memorial Auditorium. The league promoted the team in conjunction with the Buffalo Sabres. Final league attendance numbers for the 1991 season reached 287,654. On April 20, 1991, the National Division All-Stars defeated the American Division All-Stars, 25–20, in the inaugural League All-Star Game at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The league opened the sixth season with 7 teams with the expansion Buffalo Bandits joining the league. Each of the 7 teams played an 8-game schedule with 4 home games and 4 road games. The Buffalo Bandits defeated the Philadelphia Wings, 20–11, in their first ever sellout of 16,325 in Memorial Auditorium. It marked the second sellout in league history. The Buffalo Bandits defeated the Baltimore Thunder in front of their second sellout crowd of the season at the Memorial Auditorium, 16,325. It also marked the first time a team sold out 2 games in the same season. The expansion Buffalo Bandits advanced to the League Championship Game by defeating the Detroit Turbos and the Gait brothers, 19–16, to win the National Division crown. The Philadelphia Wings defeated the Saints, 8–6, to capture the American Division Championship. For the first time, an expansion team won the league's World Championship, as the Buffalo Bandits defeated the Philadelphia Wings, 11–10, in overtime. Buffalo won their second consecutive League Championship with a 13–12 comeback victory over the Philadelphia Wings before 16,325 in the sold-out Memorial Auditorium. The Bandits kept their 18-game winning streak alive, the longest in professional sports. Buffalo joined the Wings as the only team in league history to win back-to-back championships. The League and the Players Association announced a 3-year contract agreement and the league signed a 6-year agreement with ESPN. ESPN2's first Monday night broadcast featured the Detroit Turbos against the Baltimore Thunder. The Philadelphia Wings denied the Buffalo Bandits a third consecutive World Championship by defeating the Bandits, 26–15, in front of a sellout crowd of 16,284 at Memorial Auditorium. The win gave the Wings its third League Championship in their history, the most of any league team. ESPN broadcast the game live from Buffalo, marking the first live telecast by ESPN of a league game. The league announced that Rochester, New York, would be awarded an expansion team for the 1995 season. The expansion Rochester Knighthawks won their inaugural game, 12–8, against the New York Saints in the War Memorial.

For the first time in league history, Paul Gait of Rochester played against his twin brother Gary Gait of Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Wings won back-to-back championships by defeating the Rochester Knighthawks, 15–14, in a thrilling overtime game. As of 1995, the Wings had won 4 league titles in their 9-year history.

In addition, the Boston Blazers announced their new home in the Fleet Center for 1996. Another big crowd of 16,818, the fourth largest in league history, watched the Wings defeat the Charlotte Cobras at CoreStates Spectrum in Philadelphia. The Wings advanced to their fifth consecutive league championship game by defeating the Boston Blazers, 10–8, a week before. That was the final MILL game to be played in the historic arena. However, the Buffalo Bandits played spoiler to the Wings, and denied them a third consecutive league championship, as Buffalo beat Philadelphia, 15–10, in the 1996 league championship game, in front of a sold-out Memorial Auditorium in Buffalo. The Bandits picked up their third championship win, and said goodbye to their own arena, at the culmination of the season. The 11th season opened with 3 games, including Rochester playing Buffalo at the Bandits' new home, the Marine Midland Arena, in front of a new league record crowd of 18,595 fans.

However, just a few days later, the NLL announced that the Ravens would not play in the 2008 season. Although a local tabloid made mention of a potential return in 2011 for the team, Commissioner Daniel announced that there would be no expansion in 2011.

In the early 2000s, CNN Sports Illustrated aired NLL games regularly. The NLL had had its All-Star Games and Championship games on NBC in 2005 and ESPN2 in 2006. In 2007, the NLL had a regularly scheduled "Game of the Week" on Versus, the network now known as NBC Sports Network and home of the Indycar Series, NHL, Tour de France, and PBR. For the 2008 season, due to dispute between the Professional Lacrosse Players' Association and the NLL owners in completing the collective bargaining agreement, the "Game of the Week" on Versus was cancelled. For the 2011 season, the NLL returned to Versus, beginning with coverage of the 2011 All-Star Game, followed by 6 weekly games, and 2 playoff games, one of these being the championship game. Beginning with the 2012 NLL season, U.S. broadcast rights shifted to the CBS Sports Network, carrying 8 regular season games, all of them live. Regional sports networks also provide some coverage of individual teams. Also in 2007, the NLL signed an agreement with Sirius Satellite Radio, who has been named "Official Satellite Radio Partner". The pact includes a "Game of the Week" as well as weekly highlight show. Time Warner Cable SportsNet carries games from the Rochester Knighthawks and some games from the Buffalo Bandits. In Canada, TSN and TSN2 also air NLL games, however their game coverage is primarily focused on the Toronto Rock.
