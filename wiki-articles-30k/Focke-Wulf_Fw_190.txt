 The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Würger () is a German single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank in the late 1930s and widely used during World War II. Along with its well-known counterpart, the Messerschmitt Bf 109, the Fw 190 became the backbone of the Luftwaffe's Jagdwaffe (Fighter Force). The twin-row BMW 801 radial engine that powered most operational versions enabled the Fw 190 to lift larger loads than the Bf 109, allowing its use as a day fighter, fighter-bomber, ground-attack aircraft and, to a lesser degree, night fighter. The Fw 190A started flying operationally over France in August 1941, and quickly proved superior in all but turn radius to the Royal Air Force's main front-line fighter, the Spitfire Mk. V,Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 225. especially at low and medium altitudes. The 190 maintained superiority over Allied fighters until the introduction of the improved Spitfire Mk. IX.Delve 2007, p. 80. In November/December 1942, the Fw 190 made its air combat debut on the Eastern Front, finding much success in fighter wings and specialised ground attack units called Schlachtgeschwader (Battle Wings or Strike Wings) from October 1943 onwards. In the opinion of German pilots who flew both the Bf 109 and the Fw 190, the latter provided increased firepower and, at low to medium altitude, manoeuvrability. The Fw 190A series' performance decreased at high altitudes (usually 6,000&nbsp;m (20,000&nbsp;ft) and above), which reduced its effectiveness as a high-altitude interceptor. From the Fw 190s inception, there had been ongoing efforts to address this with a turbosupercharged BMW 801 in the B model, the C model with the Daimler-Benz DB 603, and the D model with the Junkers Jumo 213. Problems with the turbos meant only the D model would see service, entering service in September 1944. While these "long nose" versions gave them parity with Allied opponents, it arrived far too late in the war to have any real effect. The Fw 190 was well-liked by its pilots. Some of the Luftwaffe's most successful fighter aces claimed a great many of their kills while flying it, including Otto Kittel, Walter Nowotny and Erich Rudorffer. Between 1934 and 1935 the German Ministry of Aviation (RLM) ran a contest to produce a modern fighter for the rearming Luftwaffe. Kurt Tank entered the parasol-winged Fw 159 into the contest, against the Arado Ar 80, Heinkel He 112 and Messerschmitt Bf 109. The Fw 159 was hopelessly outclassed, and was soon eliminated from the competition along with the Ar 80. The He 112 and Bf 109 were generally similar in design but the 109's lightweight construction gave it performance edge the 112 was never able to match. On 12 March 1936 the 109 was declared the winner. Even before the 109 had entered squadron service, in autumn 1937 the RLM sent out a new tender asking various designers for a new fighter to fight alongside the Bf 109. Although the Bf 109 was an extremely competitive fighter, the Ministry was worried that future foreign designs might outclass it, and wanted to have new aircraft under development to meet these possible challenges.Shacklady 2005, p. 25. Kurt Tank responded with a number of designs, most based around a liquid-cooled inline engine. However, it was not until a design was presented using the air-cooled, 14-cylinder BMW 139 radial engine that the Ministry of Aviation's interest was aroused.Smith and Creek 2014, pp. 33-34. As this design used a radial engine, it would not compete with the inline-powered Bf 109 for engines, when there were already too few Daimler-Benz DB 601s to go around.Green and Swanborough 2001, p. 13. This was not the case for competing designs like the Heinkel He 100 or twin-engined Focke-Wulf Fw 187, where production would compete with the 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 for engine supplies. After the war, Tank denied a rumour that he had to "fight a battle" with the Ministry to convince them of the radial engine's merits.Price 2009, p. 3. At the time, the use of radial engines in land-based fighters was relatively rare in Europe, as it was believed that their large frontal area would cause too much drag on something as small as a fighter. Tank was not convinced of this, having witnessed the successful use of radial engines by the U.S. Navy, and felt a properly streamlined installation would eliminate this problem. The hottest points on any air-cooled engine are the cylinder heads, located along the outside diameter of a radial engine. In order to provide sufficient air to cool the engine, airflow had to be maximized at this outer edge. This was normally accomplished by leaving the majority of the front face of the engine open to the air, causing considerable drag. During the late 1920s, NACA led development of a dramatic improvement by placing an airfoil-shaped ring around the outside of the cylinder heads (the NACA cowling). The shaping accelerated the air as it entered the front of the cowl, increasing the total airflow, and allowing the opening in front of the engine to be made smaller.Hansen, James. "Engineering Science and the Development of the NACA Low-Drag Engine Cowling", Chapter 1. The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy, NASA, 1998. Tank introduced a further refinement to this basic concept. He suggested placing most of the airflow components on the propeller, in the form of a oversized propeller spinner whose outside diameter was the same as the engine. The cowl around the engine proper was greatly simplified, essentially a basic cylinder. Air entered through a small hole at the centre of the spinner, and was directed through ductwork in the spinner so it was blowing rearward along the cylinder heads. To provide enough airflow, a cone was placed in the centre of the hole, over the propeller hub, which was intended to compress the airflow and allow a smaller opening to be used. In theory, the tight-fitting cowling also provided some thrust due to the compression and heating of air as it flowed through the cowling.Price 2000, p. 6. As to the rest of the design philosophy, Tank wanted something more than an aircraft built only for speed. Tank outlined the reasoning: In contrast to the complex, failure-prone fuselage mounted main gear legs of the earlier Fw 159, one of the main features of the Fw 190 was its wide-tracked, inwards-retracting landing gear. They were designed to withstand a sink rate of 4.5 meters per second (15 feet per second, 900 feet per minute), double the strength factor usually required. Hydraulic wheel brakes were used.Caygill 2002, p. 6.  The wide-track landing gear produced better ground handling characteristics, and the Fw 190 suffered fewer ground accidents than the Bf 109. (The Bf 109's narrow-track, outwards-retracting landing gear hinged on its wing root structure to help lower weight, but this led to inherent weakness and many failures and ground loops.) The Fw 190's retractable tail gear used a cable, which was guided over a set of pulleys located in the vertical fin, to pull the oleo strut upwards into the lower fuselage. On some versions of the Fw 190 an extended oleo strut could be fitted for larger-sized loads (such as bombs or even a torpedo) beneath the fuselage. Most aircraft of the era used cables and pulleys to operate their controls. The cables tended to stretch, resulting in the sensations of "give" and "play" that made the controls less crisp and responsive, and required constant maintenance to correct. For the new design, the team replaced the cables with rigid pushrods and bearings to eliminate this problem. Another innovation was making the controls as light as possible. The maximum resistance of the ailerons was limited to  as the average man's wrist could not exert a greater force. The empennage (tail assembly) featured relatively small and well-balanced horizontal and vertical surfaces.Spenser 1987, p. 12. The design team also attempted to minimize changes in the aircraft's trim at varying speeds, thus reducing the pilot's workload. They were so successful in this regard that they found in-flight-adjustable aileron and rudder trim tabs were not necessary. Small, fixed tabs were fitted to control surfaces and adjusted for proper balance during initial test flights. Only the elevator trim needed to be adjusted in flight (a feature common to all aircraft). This was accomplished by tilting the entire horizontal tailplane with an electric motor, with an angle of incidence ranging from -3° to +5°.Price 2009, pp. 3-4. Another aspect of the new design was the extensive use of electrically powered equipment instead of the hydraulic systems used by most aircraft manufacturers of the time. On the first two prototypes, the main landing gear was hydraulic. Starting with the third prototype, the undercarriage was operated by push buttons controlling electric motors in the wings, and was kept in position by electric up and down-locks.Stephenson, Robert and E. Brown Ryle III. "Fw 190 Undercarriage." HyperScale—An Online Magazine for Aircraft and Armour Modellers, 2003. Retrieved: 14 February 2008. The armament was also loaded and fired electrically. Tank believed that service use would prove that electrically powered systems were more reliable and more rugged than hydraulics, electric lines being much less prone to damage from enemy fire. Like the Bf 109, the Fw 190 featured a fairly small wing planform with relatively high wing loading. This presents a trade-off in performance. An aircraft with a smaller wing suffers less drag under most flight conditions and therefore flies faster and may have better range. However, it also means the wing generates less lift at lower speeds, making it less maneuverable and also reduces performance in the thinner air at higher altitudes. The wings spanned 9.5&nbsp;m (31&nbsp;ft 2&nbsp;in) and had an area of 15&nbsp;m² (161&nbsp;ft²). The wing was designed using the NACA 23015.3 airfoil at the root and the NACA 23009 airfoil at the tip.Lednicer, David. The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage. Urbana, Illinois: UIUC Applied Aerodynamics Group, 2010. Retrieved: 18 May 2011. Earlier aircraft designs generally featured canopies consisting of small plates of perspex (called plexiglas in the United States) in a metal framework, with the top of the canopy even with the rear fuselage. This design considerably limited visibility, especially to the rear. The introduction of vacuum forming led to the creation of the "bubble canopy" which was largely self-supporting, and could be mounted over the cockpit, offering greatly improved all-round visability. Tank's design for the Fw 190 used a canopy with a frame that ran around the perimeter, with only a short, centerline seam along the top, running rearward from the radio antenna fitting where the three-panel windscreen and forward edge of the canopy met, just in front of the pilot. The eventual choice of the BMW 801 14-cylinder radial over the more troublesome BMW 139 also brought with it a BMW-designed cowling "system" which integrated the radiator used to cool the motor oil. An annular, ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the oil cooler's core was in contact with the main cowling's sheetmetal. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side on the inside of the oil cooler core. Together, the metal ring and cowling formed an S-shaped duct with the oil cooler's core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine forward across the oil cooler core to provide cooling for the 801's motor oil. The rate of cooling airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring in order to open or close the gap. The reasons for this complex system were threefold. One was to reduce any extra aerodynamic drag of the oil radiator, in this case largely eliminating it by placing it within the same cowling as the engine. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the radiator to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the radiator behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The downside to this design was that the radiator was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed. Spenser 1987, p. 56. :Fw 190 A-3/Umrüst-Bausatz 1 (/U1) - (W.Nr 130270) was the first 190 to have the engine mount extended by 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in), which would be standardized on the later production A-5 model. :Fw 190 A-3/U2 - The A-3/U2 (W.Nr 130386) had  RZ 65 73&nbsp;mm (2.87&nbsp;in) rocket launcher racks under the wings with three rockets per wing. There were also a small number of U7 aircraft tested as high-altitude fighters armed with only two 20&nbsp;mm MG 151 cannon, but with reduced overall weight. :Fw 190 A-3/U3 - The A-3/U3 was the first of the Jabo (Jagdbomber), using an ETC-501 centre-line bomb rack able to carry up to 500&nbsp;kg (1,100&nbsp;lb) of bombs or, with horizontal stabilising bars, one 300&nbsp;L (80&nbsp;US gal) drop tank. The U3 retained the fuselage-mounted 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) MG 17s and the wing-mounted 20&nbsp;mm MG 151 cannon, with the outer MG FF being removed.Page 2002, p. 284. :Fw 190 A-3/U4 - The A-3/U4 was a reconnaissance version with two RB 12.5 cameras in the rear fuselage and a EK 16 gun camera or a Robot II miniature camera in the leading edge of the port wing root. Armament was similar to the U3, however, and the ETC 501 was usually fitted with the standardized Luftwaffe 300 litre-capacity (80&nbsp;US gal) drop tank. :Fw 190 A-4/Rüstsatz 6 (/R6) - Some A-4s were fitted with a pair of under-wing Werfer-Granate 21 (BR 21) rocket mortars, and were designated Fw 190 A-4/R6. :Fw 190 A-4/U1 - The A-4/U1 was outfitted with an ETC 501 rack under the fuselage. All armament except for the MG 151 cannon was removed. :Fw 190 A-4/U3 - The A-4/U3 was very similar to the U1, and later served as the prototype for the Fw 190 F-1 assault fighter. :Fw 190 A-4/U4 - The A-4/U4 was a reconnaissance fighter, with two Rb 12.4 cameras in the rear fuselage and an EK 16 or Robot II gun camera. The U4 was equipped with fuselage-mounted 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) MG 17s and 20&nbsp;mm MG 151 cannon. :Fw 190 A-4/U7 - The A-4/U7 was a high-altitude fighter, easily identified by the compressor air intakes on either side of the cowling. Adolf Galland flew a U7 in the spring of 1943. :Fw 190 A-4/U8 - The A-4/U8 was the Jabo-Rei (Jagdbomber Reichweite, long-range fighter-bomber), adding a 300&nbsp;L (80&nbsp;US gal) drop tank under each wing, on VTr-Ju 87 racks with duralumin fairings produced by Weserflug, and a centreline bomb rack. The outer wing-mounted 20&nbsp;mm MG FF/M cannon and the cowling-mounted 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) MG 17 were removed to save weight. The A-4/U8 was the precursor of the Fw 190 G-1. :Fw 190 A-4/R1 - The A-4/R1, was fitted with a FuG 16ZY radio set with a Morane "whip" aerial fitted under the port wing. These aircraft, called Leitjäger or Fighter Formation Leaders, could be tracked and directed from the ground via special R/T equipment called Y-Verfahren. More frequent use of this equipment was made from the A-5 onwards.Page 2002, p. 587   :Fw 190 A-5/U2 - The A-5/U2 was designed as a night Jabo-Rei and featured anti-reflective fittings and exhaust flame dampeners. A centre-line ETC 501 rack typically held a 250&nbsp;kg (550&nbsp;lb) bomb, and wing-mounted racks mounted 300&nbsp;L drop tanks. A EK16 gun camera, as well as landing lights, were fitted to the wing leading edge. The U2 was armed with only two 20&nbsp;mm MG 151 cannon. :Fw 190 A-5/U3 - The A-5/U3 was a Jabo fighter fitted with ETC 501s for drop tanks and bombs; it too featured only two MG 151s for armament. :Fw 190 A-5/U4 - The A-5/U4 was a "recon" fighter with two RB 12.5 cameras and all armament of the basic A-5 with the exception of the MG FF cannon. :Fw 190 A-5/U8 - The A-5/U8 was another Jabo-Rei outfitted with SC-250 centreline-mounted bombs, under-wing 300-litre drop tanks and only two MG 151s; it later became the Fw 190 G-2. :Fw 190 A-5/U9 - Test installation of the A-7 modifications. :Fw 190 A-5/U12 - A special U12 was created for bomber attack, outfitted with the standard 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) MG 17 and 20&nbsp;mm MG 151 but replacing the outer wing 20&nbsp;mm MG-FF cannon with two underwing gun pods containing two 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 each, for a total of two machine guns and six cannon. :Fw 190 A-5/R11 - The A-5/R11 was a night fighter conversion fitted with FuG 217 Neptun (Neptune) radar equipment with arrays of three dipole antenna elements vertically mounted fore and aft of the cockpit and above and below the wings. Flame-dampening boxes were fitted over the exhaust exits. 1,752 A-5s were built from November 1942 to June 1943.Janowicz 2001, pp. 34–38. :Fw 190 A-8/R2 - The A-8/R2 replaced the outer wing 20&nbsp;mm cannon with a 30&nbsp;mm (1.18&nbsp;in) MK 108 cannon. :Fw 190 A-8/R4 - The A-8/R4 featured GM1 nitrous boost to the standard BMW 801 D/Q engine. GM1(nitrious oxide) injection increased power for short amounts of time, up to 10 minutes at a time. A 20 minute supply was usually carried. :Fw 190 A-8/R8 - The A-8/R8 was similar to the A-8/R2, but fitted with heavy armour including 30&nbsp;mm (1.18&nbsp;in) canopy and windscreen armour and 5&nbsp;mm (.2&nbsp;in) cockpit armour.Janowicz 2001, pp. 41–43. A total of 13,291 Fw 190 A-model aircraft were produced.Janowicz 2001, pp. 66–67.  Tank started looking at ways to address the altitude performance problem early in the program. In 1941, he proposed a number of versions featuring new powerplants, and he suggested using turbochargers in place of superchargers. Three such installations were outlined   :Fw 190 F-4 to Fw 190 F-7 -  designations used for projects. :Fw 190 F-8/U1 - long range JaBo, fitted with underwing V.Mtt-Schloß shackles to hold two 300&nbsp;L (80&nbsp;US gal) fuel tanks. ETC 503 bomb racks were also fitted, allowing the Fw 190 F-8/U1 to carry one SC 250 bomb under each wing and one SC 250 bomb on the centreline. :Fw 190 F-8/U2 - torpedo bomber was fitted with an ETC 503 bomb rack under each wing and a centre-line mounted ETC 504. The U2 was also equipped with the TSA 2 A weapons sighting system that improved the U2's ability to attack seaborne targets with a  BT 700.Mondey 2006, p. 72. :Fw 190 F-8/U3 - heavy torpedo bomber was outfitted with an ETC 502, which allowed it to carry one BT-1400 heavy torpedo (). Owing to the size of the torpedo, the U3's tail gear needed to be lengthened. The U3 also was fitted with the 2,000&nbsp;PS BMW 801S engine, and the tail from the Ta 152. :Fw 190 F-8/U4 - created as a night fighter, was equipped with flame dampers on the exhaust and various electrical systems such as the FuG 101 radio altimeter, the PKS 12 automatic pilot, and the TSA 2 A sighting system. Weapons fitted ranged from torpedoes to bombs; however, the U4 was fitted with only two MG 151/20 cannon as fixed armament. :Fw 190 G-3/R1 - The G-3/R1 replaced the V.Fw. Trg racks with WB 151/20 cannon pods, giving the G-3/R1 a total of six 20&nbsp;mm cannon. :Fw 190 G-3/R5 - The G-3/R5 was similar to the R1, but the V.Fw. Trg racks were removed, and two ETC 50 racks per wing were added. :Fw 190 G-8/R4 - The G-8/R4 kit was a planned refit for the GM 1 engine boost system, but never made it into production. :Fw 190 G-8/R5 - The G-8/R5 kit replaced the ETC 503 racks with two ETC 50 or 71 racks.  The Fw 190 participated on every major combat front where the Luftwaffe operated after 1941, and did so with success in a variety of roles. Luftwaffe pilots who flew both the Fw 190 and the Bf 109 generally felt that, with the exception of high altitude capability, the Fw 190 was superior. A 0.40&nbsp;km² (100 acre) Focke-Wulf plant east of Marienburg was bombed by the Eighth Air Force on 9 October 1944.Gurney 1962, p. 219. In addition, one of the most important sub-contractors for the radial-engined Fw 190s was AGO Flugzeugwerke, which from 1941 through to the end of the war produced enough Fw 190s to earn it major attention from the USAAF, with the AGO plant in Oschersleben being attacked at least five times during the war from 1943 onwards.  Some 28 original Fw 190s are in museums or in the hands of private collectors around the world. In 1997, a German company, Flug Werk GmbH, began manufacturing new Fw 190 models as reproductions. By 2012 almost 20 had been produced, most flyable, a few as static display models, with airworthy examples usually powered by Chinese-manufactured Shvetsov ASh-82 twin-row, 14-cylinder radial powerplants,"Die FW 190 aus dem Flugwerk" in German). flugwerk.de.

Designated with the Stammkennzeichen alphabetic ID code of FL+OZ (later RM+CB) the V2 first flew on 31 October 1939 and was equipped from the outset with the new spinner and cooling fan. It was armed with one Rheinmetall-Borsig 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) MG 17 machine gun and one 13&nbsp;mm (.51&nbsp;in) synchronized MG 131 machine gun in each wing root.Page 2002, p. 579. Abandoned Abandoned Fitted with the larger, more powerful 14-cylinder two-row BMW 801 radial engine. This engine introduced a pioneering example of an engine management system called the Kommandogerät (command-device): in effect, an electro-mechanical computer which set mixture, propeller pitch (for the constant speed propeller), boost, and magneto timing. (kleine Fläche - small surface) The smaller span initial variant re-designated after the longer span wing was fitted. The V5 first flew in the early spring of 1940. The weight increase with all of the modifications was substantial, about 635&nbsp;kg (1,400&nbsp;lb), leading to higher wing loading and a deterioration in handling. Plans were made to create a new wing with more area to address these issues.Smith and Kay 1972, p. 175. (große Fläche - large surface) In August 1940 a collision with a ground vehicle damaged the V5 and it was sent back to the factory for major repairs. This was an opportune time to rebuild it with a new wing which was less tapered in plan than the original design, extending the leading and trailing edges outward to increase the area. The new wing had an area of 18.30&nbsp;m² (197&nbsp;ft²), and now spanned 10.506&nbsp;m (34&nbsp;ft 5&nbsp;in). After conversion, the aircraft was called the V5g for große Fläche (large surface). Although it was 10&nbsp;km/h (6&nbsp;mph) slower than when fitted with the small wing, V5g was much more manoeuvrable and had a faster climb rate. This new wing platform was to be used for all major production versions of the Fw 190. The pre-production Fw 190 A-0 series was ordered in November 1940, a total of 28 being completed. Because they were built before the new wing design was fully tested and approved, the first nine A-0s were fitted with the original small wings. All were armed with six 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) MG 17 machine guns — four synchronised weapons, two in the forward fuselage and one in each wing root, supplemented by a free-firing MG 17 in each wing, outboard of the propeller disc. The Fw 190 A-1 was in production from June 1941. It was powered by the BMW 801 C-1 engine, rated at 1,560&nbsp;PS (1,539&nbsp;hp, 1,147&nbsp;kW) for take-off. Armament included two fuselage-mounted 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) MG 17s and two wing root-mounted 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) MG 17s (in all four MG 17s synchronized to fire through the propeller arc) and two outboard wing-mounted 20&nbsp;mm MG FF/Ms.Page 2002, p. 581. The introduction of the BMW 801 C-2 resulted in the Fw 190 A-2 model, first introduced in October 1941.Page 2002, p. 583. The A-2 wing weaponry was updated, with the two wing root-mounted 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) MG 17s being replaced by 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20E cannon.Page 2002, pp. 582–583. The Fw 190 A-3 was equipped with the BMW 801 D-2 engine, which increased power to 1,700&nbsp;PS (1,677&nbsp;hp, 1,250&nbsp;kW) at takeoff. The A-3 retained the same weaponry as the A-2.Page 2002, pp. 583–584. (a=ausländisch - foreign) In autumn 1942, 72 new aircraft were delivered to Turkey in an effort to keep that country friendly to the Axis powers. These were designated Fw 190 A-3a, designation for export models and delivered between October 1942 and March 1943. Introduced in July 1942, the  A-4 was equipped with the same engine and basic armament as the A-3. The  A-5 was developed after it was determined that the Fw 190 could easily carry more ordnance. The D-2 engine was moved forward another 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) as had been tried out earlier on the service test A-3/U1 aircraft, moving the centre of gravity forward to allow more weight to be carried aft. The  A-6 was developed to address shortcomings found in previous "A" models when attacking U.S. heavy bombers. A structurally redesigned and lighter wing was introduced and the normal armament was increased to two MG 17 fuselage machine guns and four 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20E wing root and outer wing cannon with larger ammunition boxes. The  A-7 entered production in November 1943, equipped with the BMW 801 D-2 engine, again producing 1,700&nbsp;PS (1,677&nbsp;hp, 1,250&nbsp;kW) and two fuselage-mounted 13&nbsp;mm (.51&nbsp;in) MG 131s, replacing the MG 17s.Janowicz 2001, pp. 40–41. The A-8 entered production in February 1944, powered either by the standard BMW 801 D-2 or the 801Q (also known as 801TU). The 801Q/TU, with the "T" signifying a Triebwerksanlage unitized powerplant installation, was a standard 801D with improved, thicker armour on the front annular cowling, which for all BMW 801-powered aircraft in German service incorporated the BMW-designed oil cooler, upgraded from 6&nbsp;mm (.24&nbsp;in) on earlier models to 10&nbsp;mm (.39&nbsp;in). Changes introduced in the Fw 190 A-8 also included the C3-injection Erhöhte Notleistung emergency boost system to the fighter variant of the Fw 190 A (a similar system with less power had been fitted to some earlier Jabo variants of the 190 A), raising power to 1,980&nbsp;PS (1,953&nbsp;hp, 1,456&nbsp;kW) for a short time. First built in September 1944, the Fw 190 A-9 was fitted with the new BMW 801S rated at 2,000&nbsp;PS (1,973&nbsp;hp, 1,471&nbsp;kW); the more powerful 2,400&nbsp;PS (2,367&nbsp;hp, 1,765&nbsp;kW) BMW 801F-1 was still under development, and not yet available.Page 2002, p. 593.Janowicz 2001, pp. 43–45. Late in the war, the A-10 was fitted with larger wings for better maneuverability at higher altitudes, which could have allowed additional 30&nbsp;mm (1.18&nbsp;in) calibre, long-barreled MK 103 cannon to be fitted.Joineau and Breffort 2007, p. 25. (an A-0) would be outfitted with many of the elements which eventually led to the B series. (W.Nr. 0036) first C-series prototype (W.Nr. 0036) second C-series prototype (W.Nr. 0036) third C-series prototype (W.Nr. 0036) fourth C-series prototype With a turbocharged BMW 801 This aircraft was similar to the B-0, but had slightly different armament. In its initial layout, the B-1 was to be fitted with four 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) MG 17s and two 20&nbsp;mm MG-FFs. One was fitted with two MG 17s, two 20&nbsp;mm MG 151s and two 20&nbsp;mm MG-FFs. After the completion of W.Nr. 811, no further Fw 190 B models were ordered. With a turbocharged Daimler-Benz DB 603, the tail of the aircraft had to be lengthened in order to maintain the desired centre of gravity. Four additional prototypes based on the V18/U1 followed: V29, V30, V32 and V33. The Fw 190 D (nicknamed Dora; or Long-Nose Dora ("Langnasen-Dora") was intended as the high-altitude performance version of the A-series. The first D-0 prototype was completed in October 1942 with a supercharged Junkers Jumo 213 including a pressurized cockpit and other features making them more suitable for high-altitude work."Focke-Wulf Fw 190D." csd.uwo.ca. Retrieved: 23 August 2010. Initial production Initial production The D-9 series was rarely used against heavy-bomber raids, as the circumstances of the war in late 1944 meant that fighter-versus-fighter combat and ground attack missions took priority.Rodeike 1998, p. 381.Caldwell 2007, p.89.Caldwell 1998, p. 421. Fitted with the up-rated Jumo 213F series engine similar to the Jumo 213E used in the Ta-152 H series but minus the intercooler. Two 30&nbsp;mm (1.18&nbsp;in) MK 108 cannons were installed in the outer wings to complement the 20&nbsp;mm MG 151s in the inboard positions.Forsyth 1996, pp. 200, 204–205. Similar to the D-11, but featured the 30&nbsp;mm (1.18&nbsp;in) MK 108 cannon in a Motorkanone installation firing through the propeller hub. The D-13 would be fitted with a 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 motor cannon. The Fw 190F configuration was originally tested in a Fw 190 A-0/U4, starting in May 1942, fitted with centre-line and wing-mounted bomb racks. Early converted aircraft designated A-4/U3 Renamed A-5/U3s, of which 270 were built according to Focke-Wulf production logs and Ministry of Aviation acceptance reports. Based on the Fw 190 A-5/U17, which was outfitted with a centreline mounted ETC 501 bomb rack, and in the Fw 190 F-3/R1, with two ETC 50 bomb racks under each wing. The F-3 could carry a 66-Imp gal (300 liter) drop tank. A total of 432 Fw 190 F-3s were built. The A-8 model re-designated, having a slightly modified injector on the compressor which allowed for increased performance at lower altitudes for several minutes. Armament of the Fw 190 F-8 was two 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 cannon in the wing roots and two 13&nbsp;mm (.51&nbsp;in) MG 131 machine guns above the engine. based on the Fw 190 A-9, but with the new Ta 152 tail unit, a new bulged canopy as fitted to late-build A-9s, and four ETC 50 or ETC 70 bomb racks under the wings. According to Ministry of Aviation acceptance reports, 147 F-9s were built in January 1945, and perhaps several hundred more from February to May 1945. (Data for these months is missing and probably lost.) The Fw 190 G was built as a long-range attack aircraft (Jagdbomber mit vergrösserter Reichweite - abbreviated JaBo Rei). Following the success of the Fw 190 F as a Schlachtflugzeug (close support aircraft), both the Luftwaffe and Focke-Wulf began investigating ways of extending the range of the Fw 190 F. Approximately 1,300 Fw 190 Gs of all variants were new built. The G-1 was based on the A-4/U8 JaBo Rei's. Initial testing found that if all but two wing root mounted 20&nbsp;mm MG 151 cannons (with reduced ammunition load) were removed, the Fw 190 G-1 (as it was now called) could carry a 250&nbsp;kg (550&nbsp;lb) or 500&nbsp;kg (1,100&nbsp;lb) bomb on the centreline and, via an ETC 250 rack, up to a 250&nbsp;kg (550&nbsp;lb) bomb under each wing. The G-2 was based on the Fw 190 A-5/U8 aircraft, similar to the G-1; the underwing drop tank racks were replaced with the much simpler V.Mtt-Schloß fittings, to allow for a number of underwing configurations. The G-3 was based on A-6 with all but the two wing root mounted MG 151 cannons removed. The new V.Fw. Trg bombracks, however, allowed the G-3 to simultaneously carry fuel tanks and bomb loads The G-8 was based on the Fw 190 A-8, using the same "bubble" canopy as the F-8 and fitted with underwing ETC 503 racks that could carry either bombs or drop tanks. Several old Fw 190 A-5s were converted by replacing the MW 50 tank with a second cockpit. The canopy was modified, replaced with a new three-section unit that opened to the side. The rear portion of the fuselage was closed off with sheet metal. A similar conversion to the A-5/U1. A-5/U1 trainers re-designated. A-8/U1 trainers re-designated.An estimated 58 Fw 190 S-5 and S-8 models were converted or built.Janowicz 2001, pp.&nbsp;55–56. Czechoslovakian Air Force (Postwar) French Air Force - The French Air Force ordered 64 aircraft post-war from the SNCA aircraft company.  The Fw 190 A-5/A-6 model that was chosen carried the designation NC 900. The aircraft were used operationally for a short period and withdrawn due to problems with the BMW 801 engine. French Navy (Postwar) Luftwaffe Royal Hungarian Air Force received a total of 72 Fw 190F-8s starting in the November 1944. They were operated by the 102. vadászbombázó század, later 102. csatarepulö osztály (102nd Fighter-Bomber Squadron, later Wing) engaging in close-support missions on the Eastern Front in 1944–45.Bonhardt et al. 1992, p. 358. Japanese Army Air Force received one Fw 190A-5 for evaluation purposes.Caygill 2002, p. 34. Spanish Air Force - The Spanish Air Force operated Fw 190A-2,3,4 among Fw 190 A-8 and Gs with volunteers of Escuadrilla Azul (15ª Spanische Staffel, JG 51 "Mölders" VIII. Fliegerkorps, belonged in LuftFlotte 4) on the Eastern Front (from Orel during September 1942 to Bobruisk, during July 1943) and Defense of the Reich over Germany. Royal Romanian Air Force - Following the 23 August 1944 coup by King Michael, which resulted in Romania leaving the Axis powers, Romania captured 22 Luftwaffe Fw 190 As and Fs.Dénes 1999, p. 45.Axworthy 1995, p. 279. They were not used operationally.Dénes 1999, p. 29. Nine serviceable Fw 190s were later confiscated by the Soviet Union.Axworthy 1995, p. 320. Turkish Air Force - The Turkish Air Force, beginning in mid-1942, received 72 examples of the Fw 190 A-3a (export model of A-3, a stood for ausländisch—foreign) from Germany to modernize their air force. These aircraft were basically Fw 190 A-3s, with BMW 801 D-2 engines and FuG VIIa radios and an armament fit of four MG 17s, with the option of installing two MG-FF/M cannon in the outer wing positions. The export order was completed between October 1942 and March 1943. The Fw 190 remained in service until 1948–49.
