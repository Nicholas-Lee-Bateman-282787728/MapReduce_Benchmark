   The history of Albania emerges from the pre-history of the Balkan states around 3000 BC, with early records of Illyria in Greco-Roman historiography. The modern territory of Albania had no counterpart in the standard political divisions of classical antiquity. Rather, its modern boundaries correspond to parts of the ancient Roman provinces of Dalmatia (southern Illyricum), Macedonia (particularly Epirus Nova), and Moesia Superior. The territory remained under Roman and Byzantine control until the Slavic migrations of the 7th century. It was integrated into the Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century. The territorial nucleus of the Albanian state was formed in the Middle Ages as the Principality of Arbër and a Sicilian dependency known as the medieval Kingdom of Albania. The area was part of the Serbian Empire, but passed to the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. It remained under Ottoman control as part of the province of Rumelia until 1912, when the first independent Albanian state was founded by an Albanian Declaration of Independence following a short occupation by the Kingdom of Serbia. The formation of an Albanian national consciousness dates to the later 19th century and is part of the larger phenomenon of the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire. A short-lived monarchical state known as the Principality of Albania (1914–1925) was succeeded by an even shorter-lived first Albanian Republic (1925–1928).  Another monarchy, the Kingdom of Albania (1928–39), replaced the republic. The country endured an occupation by Italy just prior to World War II. After the collapse of the Axis powers, Albania became a communist state, the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, which for most of its duration was dominated by Enver Hoxha (died 1985). Hoxha's political heir Ramiz Alia oversaw the disintegration of the "Hoxhaist" state during the wider collapse of the Eastern Bloc in the later 1980s. The communist regime collapsed in 1990, and the former communist Party of Labour of Albania was routed in elections in March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest. The unstable economic situation led to an Albanian diaspora, mostly to Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Germany and North America during the 1990s. The crisis peaked in the Albanian Turmoil of 1997. An amelioration of the economic and political conditions in the early years of the 21st century enabled Albania to become a full member of NATO in 2009. The country is applying to join the European Union.  The first traces of human presence in Albania, dating to the Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic eras, were found in the village of Xarrë, near Sarandë and Mount Dajt near Tiranë.The Prehistory of the Balkans; and the Middle East and the Aegean world, tenth to eighth centuries B.C. John Boardman p.189-90 The objects found in a cave near Xarrë include flint and jasper objects and fossilized animal bones, while those found at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the Aurignacian culture. The Paleolithic finds of Albania show great similarities with objects of the same era found at Crvena Stijena in Montenegro and north-western Greece. Several Bronze Age artifacts from tumulus burials have been unearthed in central and southern Albania that show close connection with sites in southwestern Macedonia and Lefkada, Greece. Archeologists have come to the conclusion that these regions were inhabited from the middle of the third millennium BC by Indo-European people who spoke a Proto-Greek language. A part of this population later moved to Mycenae around 1600 BC and founded the Mycenaean civilisation there.Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond, Guy Thompson Griffith A History of Macedonia: Historical geography and prehistory.

The lands they left in central Albania were occupied during the so-called Dark Age (U10-800BC) by Illyrians, whose main habitat was in the area now called Bosnia," Another population group, the Illirii, probably the southernmost Illyrian tribe of that time that lived on the border of Albania and Montenegro, possibly neighbored the Greek tribes.John Boardman.

Wiley-Blackwell, 1995, ISBN 978-0-631-19807-9, p. 92: "Illyrii was once no more than the name of a single people... astride the modern frontier between Albania and Yugoslav Montenegro" In the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age a number of possible population movements occurred in the territories of modern Albania, for example the settlement of the Bryges in areas of southern Albania-northwestern Greece and Illyrian tribes into central Albania. The latter derived from early an Indo-European presence in the western Balkan Peninsula. The movement of the Illyrian tribes can be assumed to coincide with the beginning Iron Age in the Balkans during the early 1st millennium BC.The later (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, ISBN 0-631-19807-5, 1996, page 39: "... the other hand, the beginnings of the Iron Age around 1000 BC is held to coincide with the formation of the historical Illyrian peoples. ..." Archaeologists associate the Illyrians with the Hallstatt culture, an Iron Age people noted for production of iron, bronze swords with winged-shaped handles, and the domestication of horses. It is impossible to delineate Illyrian tribes from Paleo-Balkans in a strict linguistic sense, but areas classically included under "Illyrian" for the Balkans Iron Age include the area of the Danube, Sava, and Morava rivers to the Adriatic Sea and the Shar Mountains.   The Illyrians (;  or Illyri) were a group of tribes who inhabited the Western Balkans during classical antiquity. The territory the tribes covered came to be known as Illyria to Hellenistic and Roman authors, corresponding roughly to the area between Adriatic sea in west, Drava river in North, Morava river in east and the mouth of Vjosë river in south.The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, ISBN 978-0-631-19807-9, page 92, "Appian's description of the Illyrian territories records a southern boundary with Chaonia and Thesprotia, where ancient Epirus began south of river Aoous (Vjose)"  also mapCambridge University Press.

The [[Durrës Amphitheatre]] ((Albanian: Amfiteatri i Durrësit) )) is a historic monument from the time period located in Durrës, Albania, that was used to preach Christianity to civilians during that time.  When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in AD 395, Illyria east of the Drinus River ([[Drina]] between Bosnia and Serbia), including the lands that now form Albania, were administered by the Eastern Empire but were ecclesiastically dependent on Rome. Though the country was in the fold of Byzantium, Christians in the region remained under the jurisdiction of the Roman pope until 732. In that year the iconoclast Byzantine emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], angered by archbishops of the region because they had supported Rome in the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]], detached the church of the province from the Roman pope and placed it under the [[patriarch of Constantinople]].  When the [[East–West Schism|Christian church split in 1054 between Eastern Orthodoxy and Catholicism]], the region of southern Albania retained its ties to [[Constantinople]], while the north reverted to the jurisdiction of Rome. This split marked the first significant religious fragmentation of the country.  After the formation of the Slav principality of Dioclia (modern Montenegro), the metropolitan see of Bar was created in 1089, and dioceses in northern Albania (Shkodër, Ulcinj) became its suffragans. Starting in 1019, Albanian dioceses of the Byzantine rite were suffragans of the independent Archdiocese of Ohrid until Dyrrachion and Nicopolis, were re-established as metropolitan sees. Thereafter, only the dioceses in inner Albania (Elbasan, Krujë) remained attached to Ohrid. In the 13th century during the Venetian occupation, the Latin Archdiocese of Durrës was founded.  ==Middle Ages== {{Main|Albania in the Middle Ages}}  ===Byzantine rule and barbarian invasions (395-1347)=== {{main|Albania under the Byzantine Empire}}  [[File:Macedonia ad400.png|thumb|250px|Epirus Nova, 400 AD.]] After the region fell to the Romans in 168 BC it became part of [[Epirus nova]] that was in turn part of the Roman province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. Later it was part of provinces of the [[Byzantine empire]] called ''Themes''.  When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into East and West in 395, the territories of modern Albania became part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Beginning in the first decades of Byzantine rule (until 461), the region suffered devastating raids by [[Visigoths]], [[Huns]], and [[Ostrogoths]]. In the 6th and 7th centuries, the region experienced an influx of [[Slavs]].  The new administrative system of the themes, or military provinces created by the [[Byzantine Empire]], contributed to the eventual rise of feudalism in Albania, as peasant soldiers who served military lords became serfs on their landed estates. period. In the first decades under Byzantine rule (until 461), [[Epirus nova]] suffered the devastation of raids by [[Visigoths]], [[Huns]], and [[Ostrogoths]]. Not long after these barbarian invaders swept through the Balkans, the [[Slavs]] appeared. Between the 6th and 8th centuries they settled in Roman territories. In the 4th century, barbarian tribes began to prey upon the Roman Empire. The [[Germanic Goths]] and Asiatic [[Huns]] were the first to arrive, invading in mid-century; the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] attacked in AD 570; and the [[White Croats|White Croatian]] tribes invaded in the early 7th century.[[File:Map Dyrrhachion.svg|left|thumb|Theme of Dyrrhachium 9th century — 1205]] In general, the invaders destroyed or weakened Roman and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] cultural centers in the lands that would become Albania.<ref name="Barbarian Invasions">{{cite web | author= Raymond Zickel and Walter R.

Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)). Towards the end of the 12th century, as Byzantine central authority weakened and rebellions and regionalist secessionism became more common, the region of Arbanon became an autonomous principality ruled by its own hereditary princes.In 1258, the Sicilians took possession of the island of Corfu and the Albanian coast, from Dyrrhachium to Valona and Buthrotum and as far inland as Berat. This foothold, reformed in 1272 as the "[[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]]", was intended by the dynamic Sicilian ruler, Charles of Anjou, to become the launchpad for an overland invasion of the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines however managed to recover most of Albania by 1274, leaving only Valona and Dyrrhachium in Charles' hands. Finally, when Charles launched his much-delayed advance, it was stopped at the Siege of Berat in 1280–1281. Albania would remain largely part of Byzantine empire until the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–47|Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347]], when it fell shortly to the hands of the Serbian ruler [[Stefan Dušan|Stephen Dushan]].  ====Bulgarian Empire==== {{Main|Albania under the Bulgarian Empire}}  [[File:Arbanon location (Albania 11th century AD).png|thumb|200px|The location of [[Arbanon]] in the 11th century.

The kingdom extended from the region of Durrës (then known as Dyrrhachium) south along the coast to Butrint.After the failure of the Eighth Crusade, Charles of Anjou returned his attention to Albania.

Throughout its existence the Kingdom saw armed conflict with the Byzantine empire.By 1282 the Angevins were weakened by the Sicilian Vespers but held control of the nominal parts of Albania and even recaptured some and held out until 1368 when the kingdom's territory was reduced to a small area in Durrës.Even before the city of Durrës was captured, it was landlocked by Karl Thopia's principality. Declaring himself as Angevin descendant, with the capture of [[Durrës]] in 1368 [[Karl Topia|Karl Thopia]] created the [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Princedom of Albania]].During its existence Catholicism saw rapid spread among the population which affected the society as well as the architecture of the Kingdom.A [[Manorialism|Western type of feudalism]] was introduced and it replaced the Byzantine [[Pronoia]].  ====The Albanian principalities and the League of Lezhë==== {{main|Albanian principalities|League of Lezhë}} [[File:Venice1400.png|thumb|left|Albanian principalities in the 14th century]]In 1355 the [[Serbian Empire]] was dissolved and several Albanian principalities were formed including the [[Balsha]], [[Kastrioti family|Kastrioti]], [[Thopia]] and [[Gjin Bua Shpata|Shpata]] as the major ones.

Many Albanians won fame and fortune as soldiers, administrators, and merchants in far-flung parts of the Empire. As the centuries passed, however, Ottoman rulers lost the capacity to command the loyalty of local [[pasha]]s,  which threatened stability in the region. The [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] rulers of the 19th century struggled to shore up central authority, introducing reforms aimed at harnessing unruly pashas and checking the spread of nationalist ideas. [[Albania]] would be a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until the early 20th century.  The Ottoman period that followed was characterized by a change in the landscape through a gradual modification of the settlements with the introduction of [[bazaars]], military garrisons and mosques in many Albanian regions. Part of the Albanian population gradually converted to Islam, with many joining the [[Sufi]] Order of the [[Bektashi]]. Converting from Christianity to Islam brought considerable advantages, including access to Ottoman trade networks, bureaucratic positions and the army. As a result, many Albanians came to serve in the elite [[Janissary]] and the administrative [[Devşirme]] system.Among these were important historical figures, including [[Iljaz Hoxha]], [[Hamza Kastrioti]], [[Koca Davud Pasha]], [[Zağanos Pasha]], [[Köprülü Mehmed Pasha]] (head of the [[Köprülü family]] of [[Grand Viziers]]), the [[Bushati]] family, [[Sulejman Pasha]], [[Edhem Pasha]], [[Nezim Frakulla]], [[Haxhi Shekreti]], [[Hasan Zyko Kamberi]], [[Ali Pasha of Gucia]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] ruler of [[Egypt]],<ref>Research Institute for European and American Studies.

A culmination of the Albanian National Awakening was the League of Prizren.The league was formed at the meeting of 47 Ottoman beys in [[Prizren]] in June 18, 1878 An initial position of the league was presented in the document known as [[Kararname (League of Prizren)|Kararname]]. With this document Albanian leaders emphasized their intention to preserve and maintain the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans by supporting the [[Sublime Porte|porte]], and "to struggle in arms to defend the wholeness of the territories of Albania".In its early period the League participated in battles against Montenegro and successfully wrestled control over Plav and Gusinje after brutal warfare with Montenegrin troops.In August 1878, the [[Congress of Berlin]] ordered a commission to trace a border between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]].Finally, the [[Great power|Great Powers]] blockaded Ulcinj by sea and pressured the Ottoman authorities to bring the Albanians under control. Albanian diplomatic and military efforts were successful in wresting control of Epirus, however some lands were still ceded to Greece by 1881.  However founding figure [[Abdyl Frashëri]] influenced the League and demanded autonomy and waged open war against the Ottomans.Faced with growing international pressure "to pacify" the refractory Albanians, the sultan dispatched a large army under [[Dervish Turgut Pasha]] to suppress the League of Prizren and deliver Ulcinj to Montenegro. The League of Prizren's leaders and their families were arrested and deported. Frashëri, who originally received a death sentence, was imprisoned until 1885 and exiled until his death seven years later.A similar league was established in 1899 in Peja by former League member [[Haxhi Zeka]].The league ended its activity in 1900 after an armed conflict with the Ottoman forces.

The territory of what is now Albania was occupied by Serbia in the north and Greece in the south, leaving only a patch of land around the southern coastal city of [[Vlora]]. The unsuccessful uprising of [[Albanian Revolt of 1910|1910]], [[Albanian Revolt of 1911|1911]] and the successful and final Albanian revolt in the Ottoman Empire in [[Albanian Revolt of 1912|1912]], as well as the Montenegrin, Serbian, and Greek occupation and attempts to incorporate the land into their respective countries, led to a proclamation of independence by [[Ismail Qemali]] in Vlora, on 28 November 1912.

As a result, Herbert was offered the crown of Albania, but was dissuaded by the British Prime Minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], from accepting. Instead the offer went to [[William of Wied]], a German prince who accepted and became sovereign of the new [[Principality of Albania]].<ref name="Young1997">{{cite book|last=Young |first= Antonia |title=Albania |publisher=Clio Press |year=1997|isbn=1-85109-260-9}}</ref>  The [[Principality]] was established on 21 February 1914. The Great Powers selected [[William of Albania|Prince William of Wied]], a nephew of [[Elisabeth of Wied|Queen Elisabeth of Romania]] to become the sovereign of the newly independent Albania. A formal offer was made by 18 Albanian delegates representing the 18 districts of Albania on 21 February 1914, an offer which he accepted. Outside of Albania William was styled prince, but in Albania he was referred to as [[King of Albania|Mbret]] (King) so as not to seem inferior to the [[King of Montenegro]].This is the period, when Albanian religions got independence. The ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople recognized the autocephaly of the Albanian Orthodox Church after a meeting of the country's Albanian Orthodox congregations in Berat in August 1922. The most energetic reformers in Albania came from the Orthodox population who wanted to see Albania move quickly away from its Turkish-ruled past, during which Christians made up the underclass. Albania's conservative Sunni Muslim community broke its last ties with Constantinople in 1923, formally declaring that there had been no caliph since Muhammad himself and that Muslim Albanians pledged primary allegiance to their native country. The Muslims also banned polygamy and allowed women to choose whether or not they wanted to wear a veil. Upon termination of Albania from Turkey in 1912, as in all other fields, the customs administration continued its operation under legislation approved specifically for the procedure. With the new laws were issued for the operation of customs duty was 11% of the value of goods imported and 1% on the value of those exported.  The security was to be provided by a [[Gendarmerie]] commanded by Dutch officers. William left Albania on 3 September 1914 following a pan-Islamic revolt initiated by Essad Pasha and later headed by Haji Kamil, the latter the military commander of the "Muslim State of Central Albania" centered in Tirana. William never renounced his claim to the throne.  ===Internal revolts and foreign occupation during World War I=== [[File:1914 albania en.svg|thumb|250px|Albania in 1916.]] {{Main|Albania during World War I}} [[World War I]] interrupted all government activities in Albania, while the country was split in a number of regional governments.<ref name = "Birth of Albania" /> Political chaos engulfed Albania after the outbreak of World War I. The Albanian people split along religious and tribal lines after the prince's departure. Muslims demanded a Muslim prince and looked to Turkey as the protector of the privileges they had enjoyed. Other Albanians looked to Italy and Serbia for support. Still others, including many beys and clan chiefs, recognized no superior authority.

Italy occupied [[Vlorë]], and Serbia and Montenegro occupied parts of northern Albania until a [[Central Powers]] offensive scattered the Serbian army, which was evacuated by the French to [[Thessaloniki]]. [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and Bulgarian forces then occupied about two-thirds of the country ([[Bulgarian occupation of Albania]]).  Under the secret [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] signed in April 1915, [[Triple Entente]] powers promised Italy that it would gain Vlorë (''Valona'') and nearby lands and a protectorate over Albania in exchange for entering the war against Austria-Hungary. Serbia and Montenegro were promised much of northern Albania, and Greece was promised much of the country's southern half. The treaty left a tiny Albanian state that would be represented by Italy in its relations with the other major powers.  In September 1918, [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] forces broke through the Central Powers' lines north of Thessaloniki and within days Austro-Hungarian forces began to withdraw from Albania. On 2 October 1918 the city of [[Durrës]] was shelled on the orders of [[Louis Franchet d'Espèrey]], during the [[Battle of Durazzo (1918)|Battle of Durazzo]]: according to d'Espèrey, the [[Port of Durrës]], if not destroyed, would have served the evacuation of the Bulgarian and German armies, involved in World War I.<ref name="Kabashi">{{cite news|last=Kabashi|first=Gezim|title=Fotot e Rralla - Bombardimi i Durresit me 2 Tetor 1918 ({{lang-en|Rare Photos - Bombing of Durrës on 2 October 1918}})|url=http://gazetaedurresit.com/fotot-e-rralla-bombardimi-i-durresit-me-2-tetor-1918/|newspaper=Gazeta e Durresit|date=24 December 2012}}</ref>  When the war ended on 11 November 1918, Italy's army had occupied most of Albania; Serbia held much of the country's northern mountains; Greece occupied a sliver of land within Albania's 1913 borders; and French forces occupied Korçë and Shkodër as well as other regions with sizable Albanian populations.  ===Projects of partition in 1919–1920===  After [[World War I]], Albania was still under the occupation of Serbian and Italian forces. It was a rebellion of the respective populations of Northern and Southern Albania that pushed back the Serbs and Italians behind the recognized borders of Albania.  Albania's political confusion continued in the wake of [[World War I]]. The country lacked a single recognized government, and Albanians feared, with justification, that [[Italy]], [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Greece]] would succeed in extinguishing Albania's independence and carve up the country. Italian forces controlled Albanian political activity in the areas they occupied. The [[Serbs]], who largely dictated Yugoslavia's foreign policy after World War I, strove to take over northern Albania, and the Greeks sought to control southern Albania.  A delegation sent by a postwar [[Parliament of Albania|Albanian National Assembly]] that met at [[Durrës]] in December 1918 defended Albanian interests at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], but the conference denied Albania official representation. The National Assembly, anxious to keep Albania intact, expressed willingness to accept Italian protection and even an Italian prince as a ruler so long as it would mean Albania did not lose territory. [[Serbia]]n troops conducted actions in Albanian-populated border areas, while Albanian guerrillas operated in both [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]].  In January 1920, at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], negotiators from France, Britain, and [[Greece]] agreed to divide Albania among Yugoslavia, Italy, and Greece as a diplomatic expedient aimed at finding a compromise solution to the territorial conflict between Italy and Yugoslavia. The deal was done behind the Albanians' backs.  Members of a second [[Congress of Lushnjë|Albanian National Assembly held at Lushnjë]] in January 1920 rejected the partition plan and warned that Albanians would take up arms to defend their country's independence and territorial integrity.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The Lushnjë National Assembly appointed a four-man regency to rule the country. A [[bicameral parliament]] was also created, in which an elected lower chamber, the [[Chamber of Deputies]] (with one deputy for every 12,000 people in Albania and one for the Albanian community in the United States), appointed members of its own ranks to an upper chamber, the Senate. In February 1920, the government moved to [[Tirana]], which became Albania's capital.  [[File:Lufta e Vlorës.jpg|thumb|Albanian soldiers during the [[Vlora war]],1920.|239x239px]]One month later, in March 1920, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] intervened to block the Paris agreement. The United States underscored its support for Albania's independence by recognizing an official Albanian representative to Washington, and in December the [[League of Nations]] recognized Albania's sovereignty by admitting it as a full member. The country's borders, however, remained unsettled following the [[Vlora War|Vlora war]] in which all territory (except Saseno island) under Italian control in Albania was relinquished to the Albanian state.  [[Albania]] achieved a degree of statehood after [[World War I]], in part because of the diplomatic intercession of the United States. The country suffered from a debilitating lack of economic and social development, however, and its first years of independence were fraught with political instability. Unable to survive a predatory environment without a foreign protector, Albania became the object of tensions between [[Italy]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], which both sought to dominate the country.<ref name="Interwar Albania">{{cite web | author= Raymond Zickel and Walter R.

Between July and December 1921 alone, the premiership changed hands five times. The Popular Party's head, [[Xhafer Ypi]], formed a government in December 1921 with [[Fan S. Noli]] as foreign minister and [[Ahmed Bey Zogu]] as internal affairs minister, but Noli resigned soon after Zogu resorted to repression in an attempt to disarm the lowland Albanians despite the fact that bearing arms was a traditional custom.  When the government's enemies attacked Tirana in early 1922, Zogu stayed in the capital and, with the support of the British ambassador, repulsed the assault. He took over the premiership later in the year and turned his back on the Popular Party by announcing his engagement to the daughter of the Progressive Party leader, Shefqet Verlaci.  Zogu's protégés organized themselves into the Government Party. Noli and other Western-oriented leaders formed the Opposition Party of Democrats, which attracted all of Zogu's many personal enemies, ideological opponents, and people left unrewarded by his [[political machine]]. Ideologically, the Democrats included a broad sweep of people who advocated everything from conservative Islam to Noli's dreams of rapid modernization.  Opposition to Zogu was formidable .{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] peasants in Albania's southern lowlands loathed Zogu{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} because he supported the Muslim landowners' efforts to block land reform; [[Shkodër]]'s citizens felt shortchanged because their city did not become Albania's capital, and nationalists were dissatisfied because Zogu's government did not press Albania's claims to [[Kosovo]] or speak up more energetically for the rights of the ethnic Albanian minorities in present-day [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Greece]].  Zogu's party handily won elections for a National Assembly in early 1924.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Zogu soon stepped aside, however, handing over the premiership to [[Verlaci]] in the wake of a financial scandal{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and an assassination attempt by a young radical that left Zogu wounded. The opposition withdrew from the assembly after the leader of a nationalist youth organization, [[Avni Rustemi]], was murdered in the street outside the parliament building.  ===Noli Revolution (1924)=== {{main|June Revolution}} [[File:Fan S. Noli.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fan S. Noli]]|199x199px]] [[Fan S. Noli|Noli]]'s supporters blamed the [[Avni Rustemi|Rustemi]] murder on Zogu's Mati clansmen, who continued to practice blood vengeance. After the walkout, discontent mounted, and in June 1924 a peasant-backed insurgency had won control of Tirana. Noli became prime minister, and Zogu fled to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].  Fan Noli, an idealist, rejected demands for new elections on the grounds that Albania needed a "paternal" government. In a manifesto describing his government's program, Noli called for abolishing feudalism, resisting Italian domination, and establishing a Western-style constitutional government. Scaling back the bureaucracy, strengthening local government, assisting peasants, throwing Albania open to foreign investment, and improving the country's bleak transportation, public health, and education facilities filled out the Noli government's overly ambitious agenda. Noli encountered resistance to his program from people who had helped him oust Zogu, and he never attracted the foreign aid necessary to carry out his reform plans. Noli criticized the League of Nations for failing to settle the threat facing Albania on its land borders.  Under Fan Noli, the government set up a special tribunal that passed death sentences, in absentia, on Zogu, Verlaci, and others and confiscated their property. In Yugoslavia Zogu recruited a mercenary army, and [[Belgrade]] furnished the Albanian leader with weapons, about 1,000 Yugoslav army regulars, and [[White Emigre|Russian White Emigres]] to mount an invasion that the Serbs hoped would bring them disputed areas along the border. After Noli's regime decided to establish diplomatic relations with the [[Soviet Union]], a bitter enemy of the Serbian ruling family, Belgrade began making wild allegations that the Albanian regime was about to embrace Bolshevism.  On 13 December 1924, Zogu's Yugoslav-backed army crossed into Albanian territory. By Christmas Eve, Zogu had reclaimed the capital, and Noli and his government had fled to Italy. The Noli government lasted just 6 months and a week, and [[Ahmet Zogu]] returned with another [[coup d'état]] and regained the control, changing the political situation and abolishing principality.  ==Albanian Republic (1924–1928)== [[File:Kingzog.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Zog of Albania|Ahmed Bey Zogu]]]] {{main|Albanian Republic}} In late 1924 [[Zog of Albania|Ahmed Bey Zogu]],  regained power from an internal political power struggle against Prime Minister [[Fan Noli]] using [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] military assistance.  After defeating [[Fan Noli]]`s government, [[Ahmet Zogu]] recalled the parliament, in order to find a solution for the uncrowned principality of [[Albania]]. The parliament quickly adopted a new constitution, proclaimed Albania a republic, and granted [[Zogu]] dictatorial powers that allowed him to appoint and dismiss ministers, veto legislation, and name all major administrative personnel and a third of the Senate. The Constitution provided for a [[parliamentary republic]] with a powerful president serving as head of state and government.  [[Ahmet Zogu]] was elected president for a term of seven years by the National Assembly, prior to his proclamation King of Albanians. On 31 January, Zogu was elected president for a seven-year term. Opposition parties and civil liberties disappeared; opponents of the regime were murdered; and the press suffered strict censorship. Zogu ruled Albania using four military governors responsible to him alone. He appointed clan chieftains as reserve army officers who were kept on call to protect the regime against domestic or foreign threats.  Zogu, however, quickly turned his back on [[Belgrade]] and looked instead to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy for patronage.<ref name = "Interwar Albania" /> Under Zogu, Albania joined the Italian coalition against Yugoslavia of [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]], Hungary, and [[Bulgaria]] in 1924–1927. After the United Kingdom's and France's political intervention in 1927 with the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the alliance crumbled. Zogu maintained good relations with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s fascist regime in Italy and supported Italy's foreign policy. He would be the first and only Albanian to hold the title of president until 1991.  ==Kingdom of Albania (1928–1939)== [[File:King Zog.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Zog of Albania]]]] {{main|Kingdom of Albania (1928–39)|l1=Kingdom of Albania}} In 1928 the country's parliament declared [[Albania]] a kingdom with Zogu as King.<ref name = "Interwar Albania" /> King Zog remained a conservative, but initiated reforms. For example, in an attempt at social modernisation the custom of adding one's region to one's name was dropped. Zog also made donations of land to international organisations for the building of schools and hospitals.<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,723720,00.html 1927 Times article]</ref>  In 1928 Zogu secured the parliament's consent to its own dissolution. A new [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]] amended the constitution, making Albania a kingdom and transforming Zogu into Zog I, "King of the Albanians." International recognition arrived forthwith. The new constitution abolished the [[Parliament of Albania#1920 creation of the Senate|Albanian Senate]] and created a unicameral [[Parliament of Albania#Albanian kingdom (1928–1939)|National Assembly]], but King Zog retained the dictatorial powers he had enjoyed as President.  Soon after his incoronation, Zog broke off his engagement to [[Shefqet Verlaci]]'s daughter, and Verlaci withdrew his support for the king and began plotting against him. Zog had accumulated a great number of enemies over the years, and the Albanian tradition of blood vengeance required them to try to kill him. Zog surrounded himself with guards and rarely appeared in public.<ref name="Lendvai1969">{{cite book|author=Paul Lendvai|title=Eagles in cobwebs: nationalism and communism in the Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGRpAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 May 2012|year=1969|page=181|publisher=Doubleday}}</ref> The king's loyalists disarmed all of Albania's tribes except for his own Mati tribesmen and their allies, the Dibra.<ref name="Pearson2004">{{cite book|author=Owen Pearson|title=Albania And King Zog: Independence, Republic And Monarchy 1908–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_Sh3y9IMZAC&pg=PA304|accessdate=10 May 2012|year=2004|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-013-0|page=304|quote=He forbade the carrying of arms by civilians, enforcing this prohibition among the tribesmen by ordering all tribes to be disarmed except his own, the Moslem Mati, their allies, the Diber, and the catholic Mirdite}}</ref> Nevertheless, on a visit to [[Vienna]] in 1931, Zog and his bodyguards fought a gun battle with would-be assassins [[Aziz Çami]] and [[Ndok Gjeloshi]] on the Opera House steps.<ref name="Vickers1999">{{cite book|author = Miranda Vickers|title = The Albanians: A Modern History|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC&pg=PA66|accessdate = 10 May 2012|year = 1999|publisher = I.B.Tauris|isbn = 978-1-86064-541-9|page = 66}}</ref>  Zog remained sensitive to steadily mounting disillusion with [[Italy]]'s domination of Albania. The Albanian army, though always less than 15,000-strong, sapped the country's funds, and the Italians' monopoly on training the armed forces rankled public opinion. As a counterweight, Zog kept British officers in the [[Gendarmerie]] despite strong Italian pressure to remove them. In 1931 Zog openly stood up to the Italians, refusing to renew the 1926 First Treaty of Tirana.  === Financial crisis ===  In 1932 and 1933, Albania could not make the interest payments on its loans from the [[Society for the Economic Development of Albania]]. In response, Rome turned up the pressure, demanding that Tirana name Italians to direct the Gendarmerie; join Italy in a customs union; grant Italy control of the country's sugar, telegraph, and electrical monopolies; teach the Italian language in all Albanian schools; and admit Italian colonists. Zog refused. Instead, he ordered the national budget slashed by 30 percent, dismissed the Italian military advisers, and nationalized Italian-run Roman Catholic schools in the northern part of the country.  By June 1934, Albania had signed trade agreements with Yugoslavia and Greece, and Mussolini had suspended all payments to Tirana. An Italian attempt to intimidate the Albanians by sending a fleet of warships to Albania failed because the Albanians only allowed the forces to land unarmed. Mussolini then attempted to buy off the Albanians. In 1935 he presented the Albanian government 3 million gold francs as a gift.  Zog's success in defeating two local rebellions convinced Mussolini that the Italians had to reach a new agreement with the Albanian king. A government of young men led by [[Mehdi Frasheri]], an enlightened [[Bektashi]] administrator, won a commitment from Italy to fulfill financial promises that Mussolini had made to Albania and to grant new loans for harbor improvements at Durrës and other projects that kept the Albanian government afloat. Soon Italians began taking positions in Albania's civil service, and Italian settlers were allowed into the country.  Mussolini's forces overthrew King Zog when [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy invaded Albania]] in 1939.<ref name = "Interwar Albania" />  ==Albania during World War II== Starting in 1928, but especially during the [[Great Depression]], the government of [[King Zog]], which brought law and order to the country, began to cede Albania's sovereignty to Italy. Despite some insignificant resistance, especially at [[Durrës]], Italy invaded Albania on 7 April 1939 and took control of the country, with the Italian Fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaiming Italy's figurehead King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] as King of Albania. The nation thus became one of the first to be occupied by the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]].<ref>''The Balkans'' by [[Misha Glenny]], page 418</ref>  As [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] began his aggressions, Mussolini decided to occupy Albania as a means to compete with Hitler's territorial gains. Mussolini and the Italian Fascists saw Albania as a historical part of the [[Roman Empire]], and the occupation was intended to fulfill Mussolini's dream of creating an [[Italian Empire]]. During the Italian occupation, Albania's population was subject to a policy of forced [[Italianization]] by the kingdom's Italian governors, in which the use of the Albanian language was discouraged in schools while the Italian language was promoted. At the same time, the colonization of Albania by Italians was encouraged.  Mussolini, in October 1940, used his Albanian base to launch an attack on Greece, which led to the defeat of the Italian forces and the Greek occupation of Southern Albania in what was seen by the Greeks as the liberation of [[Northern Epirus]].

Before [[World War I]] Italy and [[Austria-Hungary]] had been instrumental in the creation of an independent Albanian state. At the outbreak of war, Italy had seized the chance to occupy the southern half of Albania, to avoid it being captured by the Austro-Hungarians. That success did not last long, as post-war domestic problems, Albanian resistance, and pressure from United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]], forced Italy to pull out in 1920.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/albania/25.htm Albania: A Country Study: Albania's Reemergence after World War I, Library of Congress]</ref>  When Mussolini took power in Italy he turned with renewed interest to Albania.

After Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia (15 March 1939) without notifying Mussolini in advance, the Italian dictator decided to proceed with his own annexation of Albania. Italy's King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] criticized the plan to take Albania as an unnecessary risk. Rome, however, delivered Tirana an ultimatum on 25 March 1939, demanding that it accede to Italy's occupation of Albania. Zog refused to accept money in exchange for countenancing a full Italian takeover and colonization of Albania.  ===Italian invasion=== [[File:Map of Albania during WWII.png|thumb|350px|A map of Albania during WWII.]] [[File:Italian army.PNG|left|thumb|212x212px|Albanian soldiers in Northern Albania, April 1939.]] On 7 April Mussolini's troops invaded Albania. The operation was led by General [[Alfredo Guzzoni]]. The invasion force was divided into three groups, which were to land successively. The most important was the first group, which was divided in four columns, each assigned to a landing area at a harbor and an inland target on which to advance. Despite some stubborn resistance by some patriots, especially at [[Durrës]], the Italians made short work of the Albanians.<ref name="LoC2" /> Durrës was captured on 7 April, Tirana the following day, Shkodër and Gjirokastër on 9 April, and almost the entire country by 10 April.  Unwilling to become an Italian puppet, King Zog, his wife, Queen [[Geraldine Apponyi]], and their infant son [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania|Leka]] fled to Greece and eventually to London. On 12 April, the Albanian parliament voted to depose Zog and unite the nation with Italy "in personal union" by offering the Albanian crown to Victor Emmanuel III.<ref>Fischer, B. J: ''Albania at War, 1939–1945'', page 36. Hurst, 1999</ref>  The parliament elected Albania's largest landowner, [[Shefqet Bej Verlaci]], as Prime Minister. Verlaci additionally served as head of state for five days until Victor Emmanuel III formally accepted the Albanian crown in a ceremony at the [[Quirinale]] palace in Rome.

The puppet [[Albanian Fascist Party]] became the ruling party of the country and the [[Italian Fascism|Fascists]] allowed [[Italian colonists in Albania|Italian citizens]] to settle in Albania and to own land so that they could gradually transform it into Italian soil.  In October 1940, during the [[Greco-Italian War]], Albania served as a staging-area for Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s unsuccessful invasion of [[Greece]]. Mussolini planned to invade Greece and other countries like [[Yugoslavia]] in the area to give Italy territorial control of most of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coastline, as part of the Fascists objective of creating the objective of ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' ("Our Sea") in which Italy would dominate the Mediterranean.  But, soon after the Italian invasion, the Greeks counter-attacked and a sizeable portion of Albania was in Greek hands (including the cities of [[Gjirokastër]] and [[Korçë]]). In April 1941, after Greece capitulated to the German forces, the Greek territorial gains in southern Albania returned to Italian command. Under Italian command came also large areas of Greece after the successful German [[Battle of Greece|invasion of Greece]].  After the fall of Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941, the Italian Fascists added to the territory of the Kingdom of Albania most of the Albanian-inhabited areas that had been previously given to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The Albanian fascists claimed in May 1941 that nearly all the Albanian populated territories were united to Albania ([http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/netre/226.gif see map]). Even areas of northern Greece ([[Chameria]]) were administered by Albanians.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} But this was even a consequence of borders that Italy and Germany agreed on when dividing their spheres of influence. Some small portions of territories with Albanian majority remained outside the new borders and contact between the two parts was practically impossible: the Albanian population under the Bulgarian rule was heavily oppressed.  ===Albania under Germany=== {{main|Albania under Nazi Germany}} After the surrender of the Italian Army in September 1943, Albania was [[Albania under Nazi Germany|occupied by the Germans]].  With the collapse of the Mussolini government in line with the Allied invasion of Italy, Germany occupied Albania in September 1943, dropping paratroopers into [[Tirana]] before the Albanian guerrillas could take the capital. The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] soon drove the guerrillas into the hills and to the south. The Nazi German government subsequently announced it would recognize the independence of a neutral Albania and set about organizing a new government, police and armed forces.  The Germans did not exert heavy-handed control over Albania's administration. Rather, they sought to gain popular support by backing causes popular with Albanians, especially the annexation of Kosovo. Many [[Balli Kombëtar]] units cooperated with the Germans against the communists and several Balli Kombëtar leaders held positions in the German-sponsored regime. Albanian collaborators, especially the [[21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian)|Skanderbeg SS Division]], also expelled and killed [[Serb]]s living in Kosovo.[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-203-1691-20, Albanien, deutsche Soldaten, italienischer Panzer.jpg|285x285px|thumb|German soldiers in Albania.]]In December 1943, a third resistance organization, an anticommunist, anti-German royalist group known as [[Legaliteti]], took shape in Albania's northern mountains. Led by [[Abaz Kupi]], it largely consisted of Geg guerrillas, supplied mainly with weapons from the allies, who withdrew their support for the NLM after the communists renounced Albania's claims on Kosovo. The capital Tirana was liberated by the partisans on 17 November 1944 after a 20-day battle. The communist partizans entirely liberated Albania from German occupation on 29 November 1944, pursuing the German army till [[Višegrad]], [[Bosnia]] (then [[Yugoslavia]]) in collaboration with the Yugoslav communist forces.  The Albanian partisans also liberated Kosovo, part of Montenegro, and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina. By November 1944, they had thrown out the Germans, being with [[Yugoslavia]] the only European nations to do so without any assistance from the allies. [[Enver Hoxha]] became the leader of the country by virtue of his position as Secretary General of the [[Albanian Communist Party]]. After having taken over power of the country, the Albanian communists launched a tremendous terror campaign, shooting intellectuals and arresting thousands of innocent people. Some died due to suffering torture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Albania was one of the few European countries occupied by the [[Axis powers]] that ended World War II with a larger Jewish population than before the war.<ref>Sarner.

During the antifascist national liberation war, the Albanian people fought against Italy and Germany, which occupied the country. In the 1939–1941 period, the antifascist resistance was led by the National Front nationalist groups and later by the Communist Party.  ====Communist resistance==== [[File:Albanian Partisans.JPG|thumb|261x261px|Male and female partisans fighting in Albania 1944]] In October 1941, the small Albanian communist groups established in [[Tirana]] an [[Albanian Communist Party]] of 130 members under the leadership of Hoxha and an eleven-man Central Committee. The Albanian communists supported the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov pact]], and did not participate in the antifascist struggle until Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. The party at first had little mass appeal, and even its youth organization netted few recruits. In mid-1942, however, party leaders increased their popularity by calling the young peoples to fight for the liberation of their country, that was occupied by [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]].  This propaganda increased the number of new recruits by many young peoples eager for freedom. In September 1942, the party organized a popular front organization, the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] (NLM), from a number of resistance groups, including several that were strongly anticommunist. During the war, the NLM's communist-dominated partisans, in the form of the [[Albanian National Liberation Army|National Liberation Army]], did not heed warnings from the Italian occupiers that there would be reprisals for guerrilla attacks. Partisan leaders, on the contrary, counted on using the lust for revenge such reprisals would elicit to win recruits.  The communists turned the so-called war of liberation into a civil war, especially after the discovery of the Dalmazzo-Kelcyra protocol, signed by the [[Balli Kombetar]]. With the intention of organizing a partisan resistance, they called a general conference in Pezë on 16 September 1942 where the [[Albanian National Liberation Front]] was set up. The Front included nationalist groups, but it was dominated by communist partisans.  In December 1942, more Albanian nationalist groups were organized. Albanians fought against the Italians while, during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] occupation, Balli Kombëtar allied itself with the Germans and clashed with Albanian communists, which continued their fight against Germans and Balli Kombëtar at the same time.  ====Nationalist resistance==== A nationalist resistance to the Italian occupiers emerged in November 1942. [[Ali Këlcyra]] and [[Midhat Frashëri]] formed the Western-oriented [[Balli Kombëtar]] (National Front).<ref name="Elsie2010">{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&pg=PA30|accessdate=10 May 2012|date=30 March 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6|page=30}}</ref> Balli Kombetar was a movement that recruited supporters from both the large landowners and peasantry. It opposed King Zog's return and called for the creation of a republic and the introduction of some economic and social reforms. The Balli Kombëtar's leaders acted conservatively, however, fearing that the occupiers would carry out reprisals against them or confiscate the landowners' estates.  ===Communist revolution in Albania (1944)===  ==== Provisional Communist administration ==== [[File:Tirana Albania 1944-11-20.jpg|thumb|263x263px|[[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|Albanian partisans]] marching in [[Tirana]], November 29, 1944.]] The communist partisans regrouped and gained control of southern Albania in January 1944. In May they called a congress of members of the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Front]] (NLF), as the movement was by then called, at [[Përmet]], which chose an Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation to act as Albania's administration and legislature. Hoxha became the chairman of the council's executive committee and the National Liberation Army's supreme commander.  The communist partisans defeated the last Balli Kombëtar forces in southern Albania by mid-summer 1944 and encountered only scattered resistance from the Balli Kombëtar and Legality when they entered central and northern Albania by the end of July. The British military mission urged the remnants of the nationalists not to oppose the communists' advance, and the Allies evacuated Kupi to Italy. Before the end of November, the main German troops had withdrawn from Tirana, and the communists took control of the capital by fighting what was left from the German army. A provisional government the communists had formed at [[Berat]] in October administered Albania with Enver Hoxha as prime minister.  ====The consequences of the war==== The NLF's strong links with Yugoslavia's communists, who also enjoyed British military and diplomatic support, guaranteed that [[Belgrade]] would play a key role in Albania's postwar order. The Allies never recognized an Albanian government in exile or King Zog, nor did they ever raise the question of Albania or its borders at any of the major wartime conferences.  No reliable statistics on Albania's wartime losses exist, but the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration reported about 30,000 Albanian war dead, 200 destroyed villages, 18,000 destroyed houses, and about 100,000 people left homeless. Albanian official statistics claim somewhat higher losses. Furthermore, thousands of [[Cham Albanians|Chams]] (Tsams, Albanians living in Northern Greece) were driven out of Greece with the justification that they had collaborated with the Nazis.  ==Socialist Albania (1944–1992)== {{main|Socialist People's Republic of Albania}}  A collection of communists moved quickly after World War II to subdue all potential political enemies in Albania, break the country's landowners and minuscule middle class, and isolate Albania from western powers in order to establish the [[People's Republic]] of Albania. By early 1945, the communists had liquidated, discredited, or driven into exile most of the country's interwar elite. The internal affairs minister, [[Koçi Xoxe]], a pro-Yugoslav erstwhile tinsmith, presided over the trial and the execution of thousands of opposition politicians, clan chiefs, and members of former Albanian governments who were condemned as "war criminals." [[File:Flag of Albania (1946-1992).svg|thumb|Flag of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Socialist Albania]] 1946-1992.]] Thousands of their family members were imprisoned for years in work camps and jails and later exiled for decades to miserable state farms built on reclaimed marshlands. The communists' consolidation of control also produced a shift in political power in [[Albania]] from the northern [[Ghegs]] to the southern [[Tosk]]s. Most communist leaders were middle-class Tosks, [[Vlach]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], and the party drew most of its recruits from [[Tosk]]-inhabited areas, while the [[Ghegs]], with their centuries-old tradition of opposing authority, distrusted the new Albanian rulers and their alien [[Marxist]] doctrines.  In December 1945, Albanians elected a new [[People's Assembly of Albania|People's Assembly]], but only candidates from the [[Democratic Front (Albania)|Democratic Front]] (previously the National Liberation Movement then the National Liberation Front) appeared on the electoral lists, and the communists used propaganda and terror tactics to gag the opposition. Official ballot tallies showed that 92% of the electorate voted and that 93% of the voters chose the Democratic Front ticket. The assembly convened in January 1946, annulled the monarchy, and transformed Albania into a "people's republic."  [[Enver Hoxha]] and [[Mehmet Shehu]] emerged as communist leaders in Albania, and are recognized by most western nations. They began to concentrate primarily on securing and maintaining their power base by killing all their political adversaries, and secondarily on preserving Albania's independence and reshaping the country according to the precepts of [[Stalinism]] so they could remain in power. Political executions were common with between 5,000 and 25,000 killed in total under the communist regime.<ref>15 Feb. 1994 Washington Times</ref><ref>"WHPSI": The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor</ref><ref>8 July 1997 NY Times</ref> Albania became an ally of the [[Soviet Union]], but this came to an end in 1956 over the advent of [[de-Stalinization]]. A strong political alliance with China followed, leading to several billion dollars in aid, which was curtailed after 1974. China cut off aid in 1978 when Albania attacked its [[Chinese economic reform|policies]] after the death of Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]]. Large-scale purges of officials occurred during the 1970s.  [[File:Annual Rate of National Income Increase of the People's Republic of Albania.png|thumb|250px|Uneasy foreign relations resulted in a decline in the rate of income increase during the 1961 to 1965 period.]] During the period of socialist construction of Albania, the country saw rapid economic growth. For the first time, Albania was beginning to produce the major part of its own commodities domestically, which in some areas were able to compete in foreign markets. During the period of 1960 to 1970, the average annual rate of increase of Albania's national income was 29 percent higher than the world average and 56 percent higher than the European average. Also during this period, because of the monopolised socialist economy, Albania was the only country in the world that imposed no imposts or taxes on its people whatsoever.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pano|first=Aristotel|title=Panorama of the Economic-Social Development of Socialist Albania|url=http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/archive/panorama.htm|publisher=Albania Today|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>  [[Enver Hoxha]], who ruled Albania for four decades, died on 11 April 1985. Soon after Hoxha's death, voices for change emerged in the Albanian society and the government began to seek closer ties with the West in order to improve economic conditions. Eventually the new regime of [[Ramiz Alia]] introduced some liberalisation, and granting the freedom to travel abroad in 1990. The new government made efforts to improve ties with the outside world. The elections of March 1991 kept the former Communists in power, but a general strike and urban opposition led to the formation of a coalition cabinet that included non-Communists.<ref>Albania. World Almanac & Book of Facts, 2008, pp467–545, (AN 28820955)</ref>  ===Albanian-Yugoslav relations=== [[File:HODŽA druhá míza.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Enver Hoxha]] in 1971.]]  Until Yugoslavia's expulsion from the [[Cominform]] in 1948, Albania acted like a Yugoslav satellite and Tito aimed to use his choke hold on the Albanian party to incorporate the entire country into Yugoslavia .{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} After Germany's withdrawal from [[Kosovo]] in late 1944, Yugoslavia's communist partisans took possession of the province and committed retaliatory massacres against Albanians. Before World War II, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia had supported transferring Kosovo to Albania, but Yugoslavia's postwar communist regime insisted on preserving the country's prewar borders.  In repudiating the 1943 [[Mukaj agreement]] under pressure from the Yugoslavs, Albania's communists had consented to restore Kosovo to Yugoslavia after the war. In January 1945, the two governments signed a treaty reincorporating Kosovo into Yugoslavia as an autonomous province. Shortly thereafter, Yugoslavia became the first country to recognize Albania's provisional government.  Relations between Albania and Yugoslavia declined, however, when the Albanians began complaining that the Yugoslavs were paying too little for Albanian raw materials and exploiting Albania through the joint stock companies. In addition, the Albanians sought investment funds to develop light industries and an oil refinery, while the Yugoslavs wanted the Albanians to concentrate on agriculture and raw-material extraction. The head of Albania's Economic Planning Commission and one of Hoxha's allies, [[Nako Spiru]], became the leading critic of Yugoslavia's efforts to exert economic control over Albania. Tito distrusted Hoxha and the other intellectuals in the Albanian party and, through Xoxe and his loyalists, attempted to unseat them.  In 1947, Yugoslavia's leaders engineered an all-out offensive against anti-Yugoslav Albanian communists, including Hoxha and Spiru. In May, Tirana announced the arrest, trial, and conviction of nine People's Assembly members, all known for opposing Yugoslavia, on charges of antistate activities. A month later, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia's Central Committee accused Hoxha of following "independent" policies and turning the Albanian people against Yugoslavia.  ===Albania and the Soviet Union=== Albania became dependent on Soviet aid and know-how after the break with Yugoslavia in 1948. In February 1949, Albania gained membership in the communist bloc's organization for coordinating economic planning, the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (Comecon). Tirana soon entered into trade agreements with [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], Hungary, [[Romania]], and the [[Soviet Union]]. Soviet and central European technical advisers took up residence in Albania, and the Soviet Union also sent Albania military advisers and built a submarine installation on [[Sazan Island]].  After the Soviet-Yugoslav split, Albania and [[Bulgaria]] were the only countries the Soviet Union could use to funnel war material to the communists fighting in Greece. What little strategic value Albania offered the Soviet Union, however, gradually shrank as nuclear arms technology developed.  Anxious to pay homage to Stalin, Albania's rulers implemented new elements of the Stalinist economic system. In 1949 Albania adopted the basic elements of the Soviet fiscal system, under which state enterprises paid direct contributions to the treasury from their profits and kept only a share authorized for self-financed investments and other purposes. In 1951, the Albanian government launched its first five-year plan, which emphasized exploiting the country's oil, chromite, copper, nickel, asphalt, and coal resources; expanding electricity production and the power grid; increasing agricultural output; and improving transportation. The government began a program of rapid industrialization after the APL's Second Party Congress and a campaign of forced collectivization of farmland in 1955. At the time, private farms still produced about 87% of Albania's agricultural output, but by 1960 the same percentage came from collective or state farms.  Stalin died in March 1953, and apparently fearing that the Soviet ruler's demise might encourage rivals within the Albanian party's ranks, neither Hoxha nor Shehu risked traveling to Moscow to attend his funeral. The Soviet Union's subsequent movement toward rapprochement with the hated Yugoslavs rankled the two Albanian leaders. Tirana soon came under pressure from Moscow to copy, at least formally, the new Soviet model for a [[collective leadership]]. In July 1953, Hoxha handed over the foreign affairs and defense portfolios to loyal followers, but he kept both the top party post and the premiership until 1954, when Shehu became Albania's prime minister. The Soviet Union, responding with an effort to raise the Albanian leaders' morale, elevated diplomatic relations between the two countries to the ambassadorial level.  Despite some initial expressions of enthusiasm, Hoxha and Shehu mistrusted [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s programs of "peaceful coexistence" and "different roads to socialism" because they appeared to pose the threat that Yugoslavia might again try to take control of Albania. Hoxha and Shehu were also alarmed at the prospect that Moscow might prefer less dogmatic rulers in Albania. Tirana and Belgrade renewed diplomatic relations in December 1953, but Hoxha refused Khrushchev's repeated appeals to rehabilitate posthumously the pro-Yugoslav Xoxe as a gesture to Tito. The Albanian duo instead tightened their grip on their country's domestic life and let the propaganda war with the Yugoslavs grind on.  ===Albania and China=== {{Main|Albania–People's Republic of China relations}} Albania played a role in the [[Sino-Soviet split]] far outweighing either its size or its importance in the communist world. By 1958 Albania stood with the People's Republic of China<ref>Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan IdentityISBN 1-85065-279-1,by Miranda Vickers & James Pettifer, 1999,page 210,"with the split in the world communist movement it moved into a close relationship with China"</ref> in opposing Moscow on issues of peaceful coexistence, [[de-Stalinization]], and Yugoslavia's "[[separate road to socialism]]" through decentralization of economic life. The Soviet Union, central European countries, and China all offered Albania large amounts of aid. Soviet leaders also promised to build a large Palace of Culture in Tirana as a symbol of the Soviet people's "love and friendship" for the Albanians.  Despite these gestures, Tirana was dissatisfied with Moscow's economic policy toward Albania. Hoxha and Shehu apparently decided in May or June 1960 that Albania was assured of Chinese support, and they openly sided with the PRC when sharp polemics erupted between the PRC and the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Ramiz Alia]], at the time a candidate-member of the Politburo and Hoxha's adviser on ideological questions, played a prominent role in the rhetoric.  Hoxha and Shehu continued their harangue against the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia at the APL's Fourth Party Congress in February 1961. During the congress, the Albanian government announced the broad outlines of the country's Third Five-Year Plan (1961–65), which allocated 54% of all investment to industry, thereby rejecting Khrushchev's wish to make Albania primarily an agricultural producer. Moscow responded by canceling aid programs and lines of credit for Albania, but the Chinese again came to the rescue.  Albanian-Chinese relations had stagnated by 1970, and when the Asian giant began to reemerge from isolation in the early 1970s, [[Mao Zedong]] and the other Communist Chinese leaders reassessed their commitment to tiny Albania. In response, Tirana began broadening its contacts with the outside world. Albania opened trade negotiations with France, Italy, and the recently independent Asian and African states, and in 1971 it normalized relations with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Greece]]. Albania's leaders abhorred the People's Republic of China's contacts with the United States in the early 1970s, and its press and radio ignored President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Nixon visit to China 1972|trip to Beijing in 1972]].  ====Banning religion==== In 1967, the authorities conducted a violent campaign to extinguish religious practice in Albania,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} claiming that religion had divided the Albanian nation and kept it mired in backwardness. Student agitators combed the countryside, forcing Albanians to quit practicing their faith. Despite complaints, even by APL members, all churches, mosques, monasteries, and other religious institutions had been closed or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, and workshops by year's end. A special decree abrogated the charters by which the country's main religious communities had operated.  ===After Hoxha===  As Hoxha's health declined, the first secretary began planning for an orderly succession.<ref name="DawishaParrott1997">{{cite book|author1=Karen Dawisha|author2=Bruce Parrott|title=Politics, Power, and the Struggle for Democracy in South-East Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNvbHCUs3tUC&pg=PA295|accessdate=10 May 2012|date=13 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59733-3|pages=295–}}</ref> In December 1976, Albania adopted its second Stalinist constitution of the postwar era.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The document guaranteed Albanians [[freedom of speech]], the press, organization, association, and assembly but subordinated these rights to the individual's duties to society as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  The constitution enshrined in law the idea of [[autarky]] and prohibited the government from seeking financial aid or credits or from forming joint companies with partners from capitalist or communist countries perceived to be "revisionist" (Having changed the original doctrines of Marx, Lenin and Stalin).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The constitution's preamble also boasted that the foundations of religious belief in Albania had been abolished.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  In 1980, Hoxha turned to [[Ramiz Alia]] to succeed him as Albania's communist patriarch, overlooking his long-standing comrade-in-arms,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Mehmet Shehu]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Hoxha first tried to convince Shehu to step aside voluntarily, but when this move failed, Hoxha arranged for all the members of the Politburo to rebuke him for allowing his son to become engaged to the daughter of a former bourgeois family.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Hoxha purged the members of Shehu's family and his supporters within the police and military.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} In November 1982, Hoxha announced that Shehu had been a foreign spy working simultaneously for the United States, British, Soviet, and Yugoslav intelligence agencies in planning the assassination of Hoxha himself.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} "He was buried like a dog", the dictator wrote in the Albanian edition of his book, ''The Titoites''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  Hoxha went into semi-retirement in early 1983,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and Alia assumed responsibility for Albania's administration.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Alia traveled extensively around Albania, standing in for Hoxha at major events and delivering addresses laying down new policies and intoning litanies to the enfeebled president.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Alia succeeded to the presidency and became legal secretary of the APL two days later.

He tried to follow in his footsteps, but the changes had already started and the fall of communism throughout south central Europe led to widespread changes within Albanian society.  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had appeared in the [[Soviet Union]] with new rules and policies  ([[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]). Alia took similar steps, signing the [[Helsinki Agreement]] and allowing pluralism under pressure from students and workers.<ref name="muse.jhu.edu">[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/election_watch/v002/index.html]  {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/election_watch/v002/index.html |date=20060425092916 }}</ref>  Under Alia's regime, the first pluralist elections took place since the communists assumed power in Albania. Alia's party won the election of 31 March 1991.<ref name="muse.jhu.edu"/> Nevertheless, it was clear that the change would not be stopped. Pursuant to a 29 April 1991 interim basic law, Albanians ratified a constitution in 1998, establishing a democratic system of government based upon the rule of law and guaranteeing the protection of fundamental human rights.  The communists retained support and governmental control in the first round of elections under the interim law, but fell two months later during a general strike. A committee of "national salvation" took over but also collapsed in half a year.

The change from the Stalinist socialist state to a pluralist parliamentary system had many challenges. The Democratic Party had to implement the reforms it had promised, but they were either too slow or didn't solve the problems, so the people were disappointed when their hopes for fast prosperity went unfulfilled.  In the general elections of June 1996 the Democratic Party tried to win an absolute majority and manipulated the results. This government collapsed in 1997 in the wake of the additional collapse of [[pyramid schemes]] and widespread corruption, which caused anarchy and rebellion throughout the country, backed up by former communists and [[Sigurimi]] former members. The government attempted to suppress the rebellion by military force but the attempt failed, due to long-term corrosion of the Armed Forces due to political and social factors.  ==Post-Socialist Albania== [[File:Boulevard, Tirana.JPG|thumb|250px|"Dëshmorët e Kombit" boulevard in [[Tirana]].]] {{Further|History of post-Communist Albania|Politics of Albania|Albanian diaspora}}  Since 1992 Albania has been seeking a closer relationship with the West. In 1992 the [[Democratic Party of Albania]] took control of the country through [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1992|parliamentary elections]], deposing the [[Communist Party of Albania (1991)|Communist Party of Albania]], and [[Sali Berisha]] held the premiership of the country.  In 1995, Albania had been accepted into the [[Council of Europe]] and requested membership in [[NATO]]. The workforce of Albania has continued to [[Immigration to Europe|emigrate]] to [[Western countries]], especially Greece and Italy.  In the early 1990s, deliberate programmes of economic and democratic reform were put in place, but Albanian inexperience with capitalism led to the proliferation of [[pyramid scheme]]s – which were not banned due to the corruption of the government. [[Anomie|Anarchy]] in late 1996 to early 1997, as a result of the collapse of these pyramid schemes, alarmed the world and prompted international mediation. In early spring 1997, Italy led a multinational military and humanitarian intervention ([[Operation Alba]]), authorized by the [[United Nations Security Council]], to help stabilize the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oberation Alba|url=http://www.un.int/slovenia/pk-alba.html|work=United Nations Website|publisher=Permanent Mission of Slovenia to the UN|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> That summer, Berisha was defeated in elections, winning just 25 seats out of a total of 156.  In the [[1997 unrest in Albania]] the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1997|general elections of June 1997]] brought the Socialists and their allies to power. [[President Berisha]] resigned from his post, and Socialists elected [[Rexhep Meidani]] as [[president of Albania]]. [[Albanian Socialist Party]] Chairman [[Fatos Nano]] was elected Prime Minister, a post which he held until October 1998, when he resigned as a result of the tense situation created in the country after the assassination of [[Azem Hajdari]], a prominent leader of the Democratic Party. [[Pandeli Majko]] was then elected Prime Minister, and he served in this post until November 1999, when he was replaced by [[Ilir Meta]]. [[File:Edi Rama 2014.jpg|left|thumb|270x270px|[[Edi Rama]],current prime minister of Albania.]] Pursuant to a 1991 interim basic law, Albanians ratified a [[Constitution of Albania|constitution]] in 1998, establishing a democratic system of government based upon the rule of law and guaranteeing the protection of fundamental human rights. Albanians approved its constitution through a popular referendum which was held in November 1998, but which was boycotted by the opposition. The general local elections of October 2000 marked the loss of control of the [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democrats]] over the local governments and a victory for the [[Albanian Socialist Party|Socialists]].  Although Albania has made strides toward democratic reform and maintaining the [[rule of law]], serious deficiencies in the electoral code remain to be addressed, as demonstrated in the June 2001 parliamentary elections.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} International observers judged the 2001 elections to be acceptable, but the [[Union for Victory Coalition]], the second-largest vote recipient, disputed the results and boycotted parliament until 31 January 2002. The Socialists re-elected [[Ilir Meta]] as [[List of Prime Ministers of Albania|Prime Minister]] in August 2001, a post which he held till February 2002, when he resigned due to party infighting.  [[Pandeli Majko]] was re-elected Prime Minister in February 2002. In the June 2005, the democratic coalition formed a government with Prime Minister [[Sali Berisha]]. His return to power in the elections of 3 July 2005 ended eight years of Socialist Party rule. After Alfred Moisiu, in 2006 [[Bamir Topi]] was elected [[President of Albania]] until 2010.  Despite the [[Politics of Albania|political situation]], the [[economy of Albania]] grew at an [[List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate|estimated]] 5% in 2007. The [[Albanian lek]] has strengthened from 143 lekë to the US dollar in 2000 to 92 lekë in 2007. In 2009 Albania&nbsp;– along with [[Croatia]]&nbsp;– officially joined the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]].  ==See also==  *[[Albanians]] *[[Albania in the Middle Ages]] *[[Bulgarian occupation of Albania]] *[[International rankings of Albania]] *[[Party of Labour of Albania]] *[[Politics of Albania]] *[[Timeline of Albanian history]]  '''Lists:''' *[[List of Kings of Albania]] *[[List of Presidents of Albania]] *[[List of Prime Ministers of Albania]]  '''General:''' *[[Historiography and nationalism]] *[[History of the Balkans]] *[[History of Europe]]  ==References== {{Reflist|30em}}  ==Bibliography== *Bushkoff, Leonard.
