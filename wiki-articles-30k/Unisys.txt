   Unisys Corporation is an American global information technology company based in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, that provides a portfolio of IT services, software, and technology.  Unisys traces its roots back to the founding of American Arithmometer Company (later Burroughs Corporation) in 1886 and the Sperry Gyroscope Company in 1910. Unisys predecessor companies also include the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, which developed the world's first commercial digital computers, the BINAC and the UNIVAC. In September 1986 Unisys was formed through the merger of the mainframe corporations Sperry and Burroughs, with Burroughs buying Sperry for $4.8 billion. The name was chosen from over 31,000 submissions in an internal competition when Chuck Ayoub submitted the word "Unisys" which was composed of parts of the words united, information and systems.  The merger was the largest in the computer industry at the time and made Unisys the second largest computer company with annual revenue of $10.5 billion. At the time of the merger, Unisys had approximately 120,000 employees. Michael Blumenthal became CEO and Chairman after the merger and resigned in 1990 after several years of losses.  James Unruh, (formerly Memorex and Honeywell) became the new CEO and Chairman after Blumenthal's departure and continued in that role until 1997, when Larry Weinbach of Arthur Anderson became the new CEO.  By 1997, layoffs had reduced world-wide employee count to approximately 30,000. In addition to hardware, both Burroughs and Sperry had a history of working on U.S. government contracts. Unisys continues to provide hardware, software, and services to various government agencies. Soon after the merger, the market for proprietary mainframe-class systems—the mainstream product of Unisys and its competitors such as IBM—began a long-term decline that continues, at a lesser rate, today.  In response, Unisys made the strategic decision to shift into high-end servers (e.g., 32 processor Windows Servers), as well as information technology (IT) services such as systems integration, outsourcing, and related technical services, while holding onto the profitable revenue stream from maintaining its installed base of proprietary mainframe hardware and applications.  Important events in the company's history include the development of the 2200 series in 1986, including the UNISYS 2200/500 CMOS mainframe, and the Micro A in 1989, the first desktop mainframe, the UNISYS ES7000 servers in 2000, and the Unisys blueprinting method of visualizing business rules and workflow in 2004. In 1988 the company acquired Convergent Technologies, makers of CTOS. Joseph McGrath served as CEO and President from January, 2005, until September, 2008; he was never named Chairman of the Board. On October 7, 2008, J. Edward Coleman replaced J. McGrath as CEO and was named Chairman of the board as well. On November 10, 2008, the company was removed from the S&P 500 index as the market capitalization of the company had fallen below the S&P 500 minimum of $4 billion. On October 6, 2014, Unisys announced that Coleman will be leaving the company effective December 1, 2014. Unisys officially announced, Peter Altabef is named new Unisys president, CEO as from January 1, 2015 in replacement of Ed Coleman.  Paul Weaver who was formerly Lead Independent Director was named Chairman Products and Services: Unisys promotes itself as a global information technology company that solves complex IT challenges for some of the world’s largest companies and government organizations.  The company offers outsourcing and managed services, systems integration and consulting services, high end server technology, cybersecurity and cloud management software, and maintenance and support services. The company’s products, services and technology include: In line with larger trends in the information technology industry, an increasing amount of Unisys revenue comes from services rather than equipment sales; in 2014, the ratio was 86% for services, up from 65% in 1997. The company maintains a portfolio of over 1,500 U.S. and non-U.S. patents. The company's mainframe line, Clearpath, is capable of running not only mainframe software, but both the Java platform and the JBoss Java EE Application Server concurrently. The Clearpath system is available in either a UNISYS 2200-based system (Sperry) or an MCP-based system (Burroughs). In 2014, Unisys phased out its CMOS processors, completing the migration of its ClearPath mainframes to Intel x86 chips. Clients are able to run the company’s long- established OS 2200 and MCP operating systems alongside more recent Windows and Linux workloads on Intel-based systems that support cloud and virtualization. The company announced its new ClearPath Dorado 8380 and 8390 systems in May, 2015, its most powerful Dorado systems ever. These new systems culminate the company’s decade-long initiative to transition its ClearPath server families from proprietary complementary metal oxide semiconductor processor technology to a software-based fabric architecture running on Intel processors. As Windows Server 2003 nears end of support on July 14, 2015, Unisys and AppZero are collaborating with Microsoft to support public sector and commercial customers globally in migrating applications to modern Microsoft platforms. In 2014, CRN ranked Unisys Stealth on its list of "Top 10 products for combatting advanced persistent threat". and ranked the Unisys Forward! platform among the "Top 10 coolest servers of 2014 (So Far)". The company claims that the solution is designed to diminish the risks of virtualizing mission-critical applications while uniting the cost efficiency and flexibility of virtualization with the reliable performance and storage features usually provided by dedicated servers. Unisys VantagePointSM - an advanced user interface and service orchestration center - was honored as Website of the Year and Best Mobile Experience at the 2014 Liferay Pulse Awards. Philadelphia's Philly311 customer-relationship management (CRM) project, implemented under a contract with Unisys, was given a Government Computer News (GCN) Award, which honors public-sector IT innovation. GCN based the award on the initiative’s success in improving citizen access to government services. The company announced during the VMworld-2014 event that it was expanding its Workspace Services Platform with a new solution for desktop virtualization to provide enterprises with cloud-based access to  business applications and services. The solution will combine Unisys’ services with the popular VMware (VMW) Horizon architecture. Unisys also signed an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement with SAP and plans to provide managed cloud services for the SAP HANA platform. These agreements strengthen Unisys’ capabilities to provide clients with real-time analytics solutions based on SAP software on the Forward! by Unisys enterprise computing platform. In September 2015 Unisys announced the launch of its modernization program and a Platform Management service to upgrade and manage the latest versions of its BMC Remedy Service Management Suite. The new services are likely to enable existing BMC Remedy users to smoothly adopt the latest versions, while also ensuring that the suite features are utilized to the maximum extent. Clients: Unisys clients are typically large corporations or government agencies, such as the New York Clearinghouse, Dell, Lufthansa Systems, Lloyds Bank, EMC, SWIFT, state governments (e.g., for [[unemployment insurance]], licensing), various branches of the U.S. military, the Federal Aviation Administration ([[FAA]]), numerous airports, the [[General Services Administration]], [[Transportation Security Administration|U.S. Transportation Security Administration]], [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[Nextel]], and [[Telefonica]] of Spain.
