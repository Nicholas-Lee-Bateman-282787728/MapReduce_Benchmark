      Bacon is a meat product prepared from a pig and usually cured. It is first cured using large quantities of salt, either in a brine or in a dry packing; the result is fresh bacon (also known as green bacon). Fresh bacon may then be further dried for weeks or months in cold air, or it may be boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried bacon is typically cooked before eating, often by frying. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but may be cooked further before eating. Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat. It is usually made from side and back cuts of pork, except in the United States and Canada, where it is most commonly prepared from pork belly (typically referred to as "streaky", "fatty", or "American style" outside of the US and Canada). The side cut has more meat and less fat than the belly. Bacon may be prepared from either of two distinct back cuts: fatback, which is almost pure fat, and pork loin, which is very lean. Bacon-cured pork loin is known as back bacon.    Bacon may be eaten smoked, boiled, fried, baked, or grilled and eaten on its own, as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts in North America) or used as a minor ingredient to flavour dishes (e.g., the Club sandwich). Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant. The word is derived from the Old High German bacho, meaning "buttock", "ham" or "side of bacon", and cognate with the Old French bacon. In contrast to the practice in the United States, in continental Europe these cuts of the pig are usually not smoked, but are instead used primarily in cubes (lardons) as a cooking ingredient, valued both as a source of fat and for its flavour. In Italy, this product is called pancetta and is usually cooked in small cubes or thinly sliced as part of an antipasto. Meat from other animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, may also be cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, and may even be referred to as "bacon". Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations, both of which prohibit the consumption of pigs. The USDA defines bacon as "the cured belly of a swine carcass"; other cuts and characteristics must be separately qualified (e.g., "smoked pork loin bacon"). For safety, bacon may be treated to prevent trichinosis, caused by Trichinella, a parasitic roundworm which can be destroyed by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking. Bacon is distinguished from salt pork and ham by differences in the brine (or dry packing). Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably sodium nitrite, and occasionally potassium nitrate (saltpeter); sodium ascorbate or erythorbate are added to accelerate curing and stabilise colour. Flavourings such as brown sugar or maple are used for some products. Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may be added to make the produce easier to slice and to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried. Today, a brine for ham, but not bacon, includes a large amount of sugar. Historically, "ham" and "bacon" referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel.  Bacon is cured through either a process of injecting with or soaking in brine or using plain salt (dry curing). In America, bacon is usually cured and smoked, and different flavours can be achieved by using various types of wood, or rarely corn cobs; peat is sometimes used in the United Kingdom. This process can take up to eighteen hours, depending on the intensity of the flavour desired. The Virginia Housewife (1824), thought to be one of the earliest American cookbooks, gives no indication that bacon is ever not smoked, though it gives no advice on flavouring, noting only that care should be taken lest the fire get too hot. In early American history, the preparation and smoking of bacon (like the making of sausage) seems to have been a gender-neutral process, one of the few food-preparation processes not divided by gender.Sarah F. McMahon, "Gender, Dietary Decisions, and Food Technology," in  Esp. pp. 186–89. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, smoked and unsmoked varieties are equally common, unsmoked being referred to as green bacon. The term streaky bacon refers to belly bacon, due to the prominence of the bands of fat. Rashers differ depending on the primal cut from which they are prepared: Bacon joints include the following: First, pork bellies are sorted by size and fat percentage. They are then placed into a large machine that rotates (often called a tumbler). This softens the bellies, which makes it easier to remove the rinds. The bellies are then cut, either manually or mechanically, to remove the skin from the meat. The skins may be used to be processed into pork rinds. The bacon is then treated by a brine solution. The brine solution may contain the flavorings, or the flavorings may be added later. After being brined, the bacon is smoked. Depending on where the bacon is made, the smoking process is different. The bacon is then cooked in an oven and soon after chilled for a few days. The cooling makes the meat firm which makes it easier to slice. After being cooled, the bacon is sliced into strips. The bacon is then cooked. The fat that cooks off the bacon is sometimes collected to be used for things like gravy and pet foods. The bacon strips are then ready for consumption. If the bacon is made for commercial use then the strips are packaged.  Traditionally, the skin is left on the cut and is known as 'bacon rind', but rindless bacon is also common throughout the English-speaking world. The meat may be bought smoked or unsmoked. Bacon is often served with eggs and sausages as part of a full breakfast. Middle bacon is the most common variety and is sold in 'rashers'. Middle bacon includes the streaky, fatty section along with the loin at one end. In response to increasing consumer diet-consciousness, some supermarkets also offer the loin section only. This is sold as 'short cut bacon' and is usually priced slightly higher than middle bacon. Both varieties are usually available with the rind removed.  An individual piece of bacon is a 'slice' or 'strip'. In Canada:    Some of the meanings of bacon overlap with the German language term Speck. Germans use the term bacon explicitly for Frühstücksspeck ('breakfast Speck') which are cured or smoked pork slices. Traditional German [[cold cut]]s favor ham over bacon, however "Wammerl" (grilled pork belly) remains popular in Bavaria.  Small bacon cubes (called "Grieben" or "Grammerln" in Austria and southern Germany) have been a rather important ingredient of various southern German dishes. They are used for adding flavor to soups and salads and for speck dumplings and various noodle and potato dishes. Instead of preparing them at home from larger slices, they began to be sold ready made as [[convenience food]]s recently as "Baconwürfel" ("bacon cubes") in German retail stores.  ===Japan=== In Japan, bacon (ベーコン)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bdword.com/japanese-meaning-or-translation-of-bacon | title=Japanese Meaning or Translation of – 'bacon' | publisher=Bdword | accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> is pronounced "bēkon".

Bacon is usually described as either streaky or back: * The term bacon on its own does not specify the cut but typically refers to back bacon. * Bacon from the pork belly, with streaks of meat and fat, is referred to as 'streaky bacon'. * Bacon from the back of the pig is referred to as 'back bacon', and usually includes a streaky bit and a lean oval bit. * Middle cuts with an eye of meat and an extended streaky section are common. * Heavily trimmed back cuts which may consist of just the eye of meat are available.  Bacon may be cured in several ways; in particular it may be described as smoked or unsmoked. Many ways of curing add water to the meat; bacon sold as "dry cured" does not have added water. For example, in a shop a particular type may be described as "dry-cured unsmoked back bacon".<ref>[http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/tesco-british-dry-cured-unsmoked-back-bacon-39551083 Typical example of description as "Dry Cured Unsmoked Back Bacon"]</ref>  Grilled<ref name="pauperedchef" /> or fried bacon rashers are included in the traditional [[full breakfast]], which varies slightly from country to country ("full Scottish", etc.).  ===United States=== A side of unsliced bacon was once known as a 'flitch';<ref>{{Cite journal |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |title=flitch |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flitch |accessdate=29 March 2008 |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} }}</ref> it is now known as a 'slab'.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bacontoday.com/whiskey-maple-glazed-slab-bacon/ | title=Whiskey Maple Glazed Slab Bacon | work=Bacon Today | accessdate=9 February 2014 | author=Hog, Boss}}</ref> An individual rasher of bacon is known as a 'slice' or 'strip'.

It is very fatty with long layers of fat running parallel to the rind. This is the most common form of bacon in the United States. Pancetta is Italian streaky bacon, smoked or aqua (unsmoked), with a strong flavour. It is generally rolled up into cylinders after curing. Middle bacon, from the side of the animal, is intermediate in cost, fat content, and flavour between streaky bacon and back bacon. Back bacon (rashers, sometimes called Canadian bacon in the United States especially when referred to as a pizza topping) comes from the loin in the middle of the back of the pig. It is a very lean, meaty cut of bacon, with less fat compared to other cuts.  It has a ham-like texture. Most bacon consumed in the United Kingdom is back bacon. Cottage bacon is thinly sliced lean pork meat from a shoulder cut that is typically oval shaped and meaty. It is cured and then sliced into round pieces for baking or frying. Jowl bacon is cured and smoked cheeks of pork. See Guanciale. Slab bacon is side bacon that is not sliced. It generally has the rind still intact, and usually has a medium to very high fraction of fat. It is made from the belly and side cuts, and from fatback. Slab bacon is not to be confused with salt pork, which is prepared from the same cuts, but is not cured. Collar bacon is taken from the back of a pig near the head. Hock, from the hog ankle joint between the ham and the foot. See Ham hock. Gammon, from the hind leg, traditionally "Wiltshire cured". See Gammon (meat). Picnic bacon is from the picnic cut, which includes the shoulder beneath the blade. It is fairly lean, but tougher than most pork cuts. The term bacon on its own or, more specifically, side baconCanadian Oxford Dictionary, 2nd ed. (2004). typically refers to bacon from the pig's belly. Back bacon refers to either smoked or unsmoked bacon cut from the boneless eye of pork loin; this is called 'Canadian bacon' in the United States when cut into a thick medallion shape. Peameal bacon is back bacon, brined and coated in fine cornmeal (historically, it was rolled in a meal made from ground dried peas). Bacon is often eaten in breakfasts, such as with cooked eggs or pancakes.
