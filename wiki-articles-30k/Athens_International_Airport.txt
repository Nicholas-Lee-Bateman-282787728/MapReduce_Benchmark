    Athens International Airport "Eleftherios Venizelos" (, Diethnís Aeroliménas Athinón "Elefthérios Venizélos") , commonly initialized as "AIA", began operation on 29 March 2001 and is the primary international airport that serves the city of Athens and the region of Attica. It is Greece's busiest airport and it serves as the hub and main base of Aegean Airlines as well as other Greek airlines. The airport is currently in Group 2 of Airports Council International (10-25 million) and as of 2015, Athens International is the 30th busiest airport in Europe. AIA is located between the towns of Markopoulo, Koropi, Spata and Loutsa, about  to the east of central Athens ( by road, due to intervening hills). The airport is named after Elefthérios Venizélos, the prominent Cretan political figure and Prime Minister of Greece, who made a significant contribution to the development of Greek aviation and the Hellenic Air Force in the 1930s. As to-date, ownership is divided between the Hellenic Republic (Greek State) and Private Sector in a 55%-45% stake following a PPP scheme for the airport company. Currently, private investors include the Copelouzos Group (5%) and PSP Investments of Canada (40%), following purchase of Hochtief's shares. The airport was constructed to replace the now-closed Athens (Ellinikon) International Airport, as the latter had reached its saturation point with no physical space for further growth. Studies for a new airport had been carried out from as early as the 1970s, with as many as 19 different locations being looked at before an area close to the town of Spata was chosen as suitable. Athens Airport SA, a state-owned company, was established in 1978 to proceed with the plans. However, after delays and slow development, the project was revived in 1991 with the then government launching an international tender for the selection of a build-own-operate-transfer partner for the airport project, with Hochtief of Germany being selected. In 1996, Athens International Airport S.A. (AIA) was established as a Public–private partnership with a 30-year concession agreement. That same year, the €2.1 billion development finally began win an estimated completion date of February 2001. The airport construction was completed five months before schedule, but was delayed opening a month due to surface connections to Attiki Odos not being completed. Its major features include two large parallel runways that are each approximately  long. The airport has received approval from the European Aviation Safety Agency and the Federal Aviation Administration for take-offs and landings of the biggest passenger jet worldwide, the A380. The first ever A380 to visit 'Eleftherios Venizelos' Athens International Airport made an emergency landing on 13 April 2011 for emergency medical reasons. The first scheduled A380 flight took place on 26 October 2012 by Emirates.http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/73923/%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%C2%AB%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B8%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%B2%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%B6%CE%AD%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82%C2%BB-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%B1%CE%BB%CF%8D%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BF-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CF%80%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CF%87%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%AC%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%B1%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%82 The Greek government-debt crisis reduced the overall passenger traffic of the airport for six consecutive years. Many long-haul airlines outright terminated service to the airport, while others chose to operate on a seasonal basis only, opting to terminate service during the winter months.Athens airport: A Greek island. The Economist (10 June 2013). Retrieved on 20 August 2013. Moreover, these problems were further exacerbated by the closure of Olympic Airlines, which operated many long-haul flights to and from the airport. In 2013, the airport handled just above 12.5 million passengers, 3.2% fewer than in 2012 and lower by approximately 25% when compared to the current all-time-high of 2007. 2014 signaled a strong recovery for the airport's passenger traffic and all statistical figures. More than ten new airlines started new flights to and from Athens. Aegean Airlines strengthened its network by 30% (with many more destinations scheduled for 2015) while Ryanair established a new base in the Athens Airport and added eight destinations. The airport company recorded an increase in passenger traffic in excess of 21% during 2014, reaching 15.1 million passengers, resulted both by new destinations but also by increased capacity offered on established ones. Characteristically, Singapore and Gulf Air resumed flights while Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways fly more frequently to/from Athens. Delta Air Lines and US Airways retained their seasonal schedules to/from USA with even more frequent connectivity. According to AIA published statistics, total traffic for 2015 achieved an impressive performance reaching almost 18.1 million passengers, an all-time-record for the airport, increased by 19% on year-over-year basis and by 1.55 million (+9.4%) the previous best, which was the pre-crisis year 2007. In addition, over the same period, aircraft traffic exhibited a solid growth of 14% year-over-year. Moreover, in 2015 a significant rise (+38%) was recorded by transfer passengers, with the international to international transfer traffic marking an impressive increase (+60%) demonstrating the significant enhancement of the Athens airport connectivity.   The airport currently has two terminals, the main terminal and the satellite terminal accessible by an underground link from the main terminal. It is designed to be extended in a modular approach over the ensuing years in order to accommodate increases in air travel. These extensions are planned in a six-phase framework. The first (and current) phase allowed the airport to accommodate 21 million passengers per year. When the airport originally opened, the current phase called for a capacity of only 16 million passengers per year; however, the capacity was able to increase without progressing to the next phase thanks to advanced IT logistics. The sixth and final expansion phase will allow the airport to accommodate an annual traffic of 50 million passengers, with the current layout leaving enough space for five more terminals to be added. As such, the parallel runway system currently in place has been designed to accommodate flight traffic with this high equivalent annual passenger load upon completion of the final expansion phase. The main terminal building handles the all intra-Schengen flights, as well as several non-Schengen flights. All of airport's 144 check-in desks are located in the Main Terminal and it has three separate levels, one for arrivals, one for departures and a food court level complete with a view of the eastern runway. Finally, the terminal is equipped with fourteen jet bridges and eleven belt conveyors for luggage. The satellite terminal has two levels, one for arrivals and the other for departures. It is also easily accessible through an underground link complete with moving walkways. The terminal is equipped with ten jet bridges and is capable of handling annual traffic of six million passengers. Due to the seasonality of traffic increases at the airport, it is only used when the traffic needs warrant it. In recent years it is was not used often and its parking stands were used for the long term storage of airliners, specifically two ex-Olympic Airways A340s and a B767 of the terminated Greek start-up carrier SkyGreece Airlines. However, as of May 2015, the satellite terminal was in full use for Schengen area flights and to accommodate increased traffic; Volotea, Niki and Germanwings are some of the airlines using the terminal. Athens International Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Greece. By the end of 2015, it was the 30th busiest airport in Europe handling a total traffic of approximately 18.1 million passengers.      The table below shows passenger totals at Athens International Airport by country destination during 2014.[ ]  A railway station is immediately adjacent to the airport terminal, accessible by an elevated walkway. Athens Metro line 3 and the suburban railway service Proastiakos run trains to and from this station. The airport is accessible by the Attiki Odos toll highway from the centre and northern Athens, Varis-Koropiou Avenue from the western part, Laurio Ave. from the South, and Spata-Loutsa Avenue from the East. A variety of parking options are available on site at the airport in three different parking lots. Located at the arrivals level, opposite the airport terminal, the airport offers short-term parking for up to five hours with 1,357 parking spaces available in lots P1 and P2. Long-term parking is located across the airport's main access road (Attiki Odos) with 5,802 parking spaces in lot P3. A free shuttle bus is available to transport passengers, while the lots are also accessible by foot to the terminal. Premium valet service is also offered at the Departures level by Entrance 3. Taxis are available at the designated Taxi waiting area located by exit 3 of the arrivals level. Limousine service is also available upon request by the inner curbside of the arrivals level between exits 3 and 4.  Four bus lines (X93, X95, X96, X97) connect directly to the Athens greater area, the intercity bus stations (KTEL Kifissos Bus Terminal and Liosion bus terminal) and Piraeus. Buses disembark passengers at the departures level and depart from the arrivals level between exits 4 and 5. Regional bus services by KTEL Express operate to the airport, currently connecting the airport to Rafina, Markopoulo, Lavrio, Kalyvia and Keratea.
