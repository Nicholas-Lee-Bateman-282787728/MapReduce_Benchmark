    Yorkshire and the Humber is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It comprises most of Yorkshire (South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire including Hull, the shire county of North Yorkshire and the City of York), North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire.  It does not include Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland (which are in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire but not in the shire county).  The population in 2011 was 5,284,000. The committees for the regions, including the one for Yorkshire and the Humber, ceased to exist upon the dissolution of Parliament on 12 April 2010; they were not re-established by the newly elected House. Regional ministers were not reappointed by the incoming Coalition Government, and the Government Offices were abolished in 2011.   In the Yorkshire and the Humber region, there is a very close relationship between the major topographical areas and the underlying geology. The Pennine chain of hills in the west is of Carboniferous origin. The central vale is Permo-Triassic. The North York Moors in the north-east of the county are Jurassic in age, while the Yorkshire Wolds and Lincolnshire Wolds to the south east are Cretaceous chalk uplands.  The region is drained by several rivers. In western and central Yorkshire, the many rivers empty their waters into the River Ouse, which reaches the North Sea via the Humber Estuary.  The most northerly of the rivers in the Ouse system is the River Swale, which drains Swaledale before passing through Richmond and meandering across the Vale of Mowbray. Next, draining Wensleydale, is the River Ure, which joins the Swale east of Boroughbridge. The River Nidd rises on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and flows along Nidderdale before reaching the Vale of York. The Ouse is the name given to the river after its confluence with the Ure at Ouse Gill Beck. The River Wharfe, which drains Wharfedale, joins the Ouse upstream of Cawood. The Rivers Aire and Calder are more southerly contributors to the River Ouse. The most southerly Yorkshire tributary is the River Don, which flows northwards to join the main river at Goole. In the far north of the county, the River Tees flows eastwards through Teesdale and empties its waters into the North Sea downstream of Middlesbrough. The smaller River Esk flows from west to east at the northern foot of the North York Moors to reach the sea at Whitby. The River Derwent rises on the North York Moors, flows south then westwards through the Vale of Pickering, then turns south again to drain the eastern part of the Vale of York. It empties into the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh.  To the east of the Yorkshire Wolds, the River Hull flows southwards to join the Humber Estuary at Kingston upon Hull. The western Pennines are served by the River Ribble, which drains westwards into the Irish Sea close to Lytham St Annes. The highest point of the region is Whernside, in the Yorkshire Dales, at . The largest freshwater lake is Hornsea Mere in the East Riding of Yorkshire. This region of England generally has cool summers and relatively mild winters, with the upland areas of the North York Moors and the Pennines experiencing the coolest weather and the Vale of York the warmest. Weather conditions vary from day to day as well as from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions, there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry, settled conditions which can lead to drought. For its latitude, this area is mild in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. Cities such as Sheffield, Leeds, and Bradford are generally cooler due to their inland and upland location, while York, Hull, and Wakefield are warmer due to their lowland location. The temperature is usually lower at night; January is the coldest time of the year and July is usually the warmest month. Snow is not uncommon in the winter, Yorkshire is mostly hilly/mountainous, and the Yorkshire Dales and the Pennines can have extreme snowstorms with high snowdrifts. Inland/upland settlements, such as Skipton or Ilkley, have more snow than coastal towns. Hull and Scarborough have less snow as their weather is moderated by the ocean. Climate data for settlements in the region:  There are seven cities in Yorkshire and the Humber: Bradford, Kingston upon Hull, Leeds, Ripon, Sheffield, Wakefield and York.  Large towns in the area include Doncaster, Grimsby, Halifax, Huddersfield and Scunthorpe.  Leeds is the largest settlement and the largest part of an urban area with a population of 1.5&nbsp;million.  Leeds is now one of the largest financial centres in the United Kingdom.  Sheffield is the second-largest settlement and is a large manufacturing centre.  Bradford is the third-largest city and was traditionally a textile manufacturing city. The decline of this industry as jobs moved offshore has resulted in a more diverse economy, as Bradford has developed new directions. Kingston upon Hull is the main port in the region and historically a notable fishing harbour.  While cities such as Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield grew during the industrial revolution, older cities in the region, such as Wakefield and York, were established in trade and politics before them. The tallest occupied building in Yorkshire is Bridgewater Place in central Leeds, commonly referred to as The Dalek. Built in 2007, at 361&nbsp;feet it is the 34th tallest building in the UK. The 37-storey Sky Plaza in Leeds is the world's second-tallest student accommodation building at 338&nbsp;feet, and the second tallest building in the region, and the UK's 42nd tallest building, built in 2009. The 32-storey St Pauls Tower is now the tallest building in Sheffield at 331&nbsp;feet. The Royal Hallamshire Hospital at 249&nbsp;feet is the tallest hospital in the UK outside of London, and was built in 1979.

The Battle of Towton in March 1461, in the Wars of the Roses, is the most costly on British soil. William Bradley of Market Weighton is the tallest British man ever, being 7ft 9in, known as the Yorkshire Giant. Bradford had the first trolley bus in the UK in 1910.  Stainless steel was invented in 1913 by Harry Brearley of Sheffield, working for Firth Brown Steels (now called Sheffield Forgemasters). Crucible steel had been invented in the 1740s by Benjamin Huntsman of Epworth in Lincolnshire (part of the region). Sheffield early steel used Swedish bar iron as it had less phosphorus. The fast acting tilting converter was a huge improvement in 1860 for Sheffield steel; the process meant high-phosphorus iron ore from local mines could be used. At one point, Sheffield was producing 10,000&nbsp;tons of steel a week. The metallurgist Eric Colbeck, when working at Hadfields Limited in Sheffield, invented boron steel for control rods for nuclear reactors. Metallurgists at Firth-Vickers developed the heat-resistant stainless steel (Rex 78) for the turbine blades of Frank Whittle's first engines, and Britain's first jet aircraft. John Marshall of Yorkshire developed the first-ever iron-framed buildings (industrial mills). Sir Robert Hadfield invented manganese steel in 1882, and silicon steel; the Hadfields site is now Meadowhall Centre. Matthew Murray of Leeds built the first commercially successful steam locomotive (Salamanca) in 1812. The Manchester–Sheffield–Wath electric railway was the UK's longest electrified railway in 1953 when opened. What is now West Yorkshire in the nineteenth century was the heart of Britain's woollen weaving wills, often using Alpaca fiber and by connections to the important Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Joseph Aspdin from Leeds invented Portland cement in 1824; when mixed with aggregates and sand, this produced concrete. John Smeaton was a famous civil engineer from Leeds, and notable for building the first modern-day lighthouse (Eddystone Lighthouse) and for developing hydraulic lime (it is able to set under water), which would lead to cement. Sir Donald Bailey (civil engineer), of Rotherham, invented the Bailey bridge which was important in the later stages of the Second World War for crossing rivers; the design took place in 1940 at the Experimental Bridging Establishment in Christchurch, Dorset (Hampshire before 1974). The Clarence Flour Mill was built in 1891 in Hull and produced Britain's first white bread; it became part of Rank Hovis McDougall (RHM) in 1962. Smith & Nephew launched Elastoplast in 1928; since 1992 this has been owned by the German Beiersdorf company. James Henry Atkinson of Leeds invented the mousetrap in 1898. ICI Fibres was headquartered in the Crimple Valley south of Harrogate; the site is now known as Hornbeam Park. The National Coal Board (NCB) was based at Coal House, Doncaster on the A18. Thomas Spencer, founder of M&S, was born in Skipton in 1851. From 1945 to 2002 all the tennis balls for Wimbledon were made by Slazenger off the A61 in the south of Barnsley. Since 2006, tracks for the UK's railways have been made at Scunthorpe, and much is made for Europe's railways (mainly France, although rolled at Hayange). The CEGB's 400&nbsp;kV Supergrid was first tested on 15 December 1963 when High Marnham Power Station connected to Monk Fryston substation (near the Selby Fork junction). FLUENT (owned since 2006 by Ansys) was developed at the University of Sheffield, and became the world's leading software for CFD, launched in October 1983. David Mellor of Sheffield produced the standard design for street furniture, including traffic lights, in the UK from 1973. Britain's first permanent traffic lights were at the junction of Park Row, Leeds and Bond Street in 1928; the US had installed its first electric traffic lights in August 1914 in Cleveland. John Harrison of Barrow upon Humber (but born in Yorkshire at Foulby), invented the marine chronometer which allowed longitude to be accurately measured, and hence navigation at sea. This allowed Captain James Cook of Whitby to colonise much of Australia. Harrison also invented the bimetallic strip and the rolling bearing, without which most vehicles could not move. Albert Crewe, born near Huddersfield in 1927 and attended grammar school in Bradford, invented the scanning electron microscope in 1970 at the Argonne National Laboratory (US). John Carbutt (1832–1905), from Sheffield and moved to America, founded his Keystone Dry Plate Works in 1879 and was the first to develop sheets of celluloid coated with photographic emulsion for making films in 1888, and for William Kennedy Dickson's Kinetoscope around 1890, which set the 35mm standard for motion and still cameras. Roundhay Garden Scene, shot on 14 October 1888 by Louis Le Prince, is the oldest surviving film in existence; 'talking' movies appeared after 1927. Dennis Taylor of T. Cooke & Sons of York invented the Cooke triplet in 1893 to stop optical aberration, and allow fine definition up to the outer edge of lenses. Prof Sir George William Gray developed LCD displays at Hull, when working for the MoD (RRE) in Malvern, developing it with the substance cyano-biphenyl in 1973; the VFD (a similar purpose) was invented in Japan in 1967. Smithson Tennant born Selby, educated in Beverley, discovered osmium and iridium in 1803; the two are atomic numbers 76 and 77, with osmium being the densest naturally occurring element, and iridium is the next densest. The worldwide deposition of high concentrations of iridium at the geological K-T stratigraphic boundary, and that locally of shocked quartz in the Yucatán Peninsula, led to a theory by Walter Alvarez in 1980 of an asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous period, known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, that wiped out the dinosaurs. Fred Hoyle was an important physicist from Bingley, who discovered how stars made chemical elements. The clergyman John Michell, a vicar of Thornhill, was the first person to calculate a realistic distance of stars, observed in the night sky, from Earth. As early as the 18th century he was also the first to propose that light from the stars could be deflected by their own gravity, and has been described as the father of seismology and magnetometry. Kenneth Bentley of Reckitt & Colman at Hull in 1963 discovered his Bentley compounds (orvinols), which included etorphine, which for many years was the most-powerful analgesic, and is the drug most often used to safely immobilise elephants and other large animals, and is now manufactured solely by MacFarlan Smith of Edinburgh. Prof Robert Lowry Turner and George Whyte-Watson developed chemotherapy for breast cancer in 1959 at Bradford Royal Infirmary. At the former Sheffield Royal Infirmary in the north-west of the city centre on 25 November 1930, Cecil Paine, a pathologist, cured patients with eye infections (including pneumococcus) completely with Penicillin, having been a bacteriology student of Alexander Fleming two years previously, and had grown Penicillium notatum (now called Penicillium chrysogenum) in some meat broth. This was the first-ever cure of human disease with an antibiotic, and only gained public attention in 1983 when his medical notes were emerged by Prof Milton Wainwright in an office in Firth Court. Howard Florey was working as a professor of pathology from 1931 to 1935 at the city's university, and Paine's work gave impetus for Florey to work out how to purify penicillin, but it would be February 1941 before he treated his first patient. Prontosil, discovered by Bayer in Wuppertal, Germany in 1932, would be the first commercially available (a sulfonamide) antibiotic. John Venn, born in Hull although moved to London, developed his well-known and ubiquitous diagrams in 1880.  The area is well known for its brass bands, with the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band, Black Dyke Band, Grimethorpe Colliery Band, Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band, Rothwell Temperance Band and Hammonds Saltaire Band. Brass bands have mostly been linked with coal mines. The Brontë family are the region's best known authors. The region's most popular city for tourists is York. Castleford is the birthplace of the world famous sculptor Henry Moore. Thomas Chippendale was an important furniture maker, born in Otley in 1718. The Bradford Small Livestock Society has held the national championships for rabbits since 1921, held at the Great Yorkshire Showground in Harrogate, and holds its Small Animal Show for other pets. Charles Hinchliffe of Huddersfield pioneered the idea of the farm shop in 1974. Donald Watson from Mexborough invented the term vegan in 1944. Seebohm Rowntree was an important social researcher from York, and had a big impact on thinking on the subject. On 6 January (Twelfth Night) each year Haxey in North Lincolnshire holds its Haxey Hood. On Easter Monday each year Gawthorpe, near Wakefield, holds the World Coal Carrying Championship.  The Yorkshire and Humber Assembly was a partnership of all local authorities in the region and representatives of various economic, social and environmental sectors. The full Assembly normally met three times a year, normally in February, June and October.  The full Assembly is responsible for providing regional leadership, agreeing regional strategic priorities, directing the development of the Integrated Regional Framework and endorsing key regional strategies. Membership comprises all 22 local authorities in this region, plus 15 Social, Economic and Environmental partners, and the National Parks for planning purposes.  On 31 March 2009, the Assembly was abolished and replaced by Local Government Yorkshire and Humber, which continues to be based in the former Assembly premises in King Street in Wakefield. Yorkshire is one of the two regions (along with the North West) that were expected to have a referendum about the establishment of an elected regional assembly. When the North East region of England rejected having an elected regional assembly in a referendum, the then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott  announced that he would not move orders for other referendums before the relevant provisions expired in June 2005.  The European constituency of Yorkshire and the Humber is coterminous with the English region. After the European Parliament election in May 2014, Yorkshire and the Humber is represented by three UK Independence Party two Labour and one Conservative MEPs.     Elected candidates are shown in bold.  Brackets indicate the number of votes per seat won.               The region has fewer degree-educated adults than the England average and the UK's highest rate of cancer. For top-tier authorities, Kingston upon Hull has the highest teenage pregnancy rate, closely followed by North East Lincolnshire. For top-tier authorities, North Yorkshire has the lowest teenage pregnancy rate. For council districts, Ryedale has the lowest rate, closely followed by Craven. Only North Yorkshire has council districts in the region. Rotherham had the UK's youngest grandmother – 26 years old. Her 12-year-old daughter gave birth on 26 August 1999.Britain's youngest grandmother For multiple deprivation in England, measured by the Indices of deprivation 2007, the most deprived council districts in the region are, in descending order – Kingston upon Hull (11th in England), Bradford (32nd), Doncaster (41st), Barnsley (43rd), North East Lincolnshire (49th), Sheffield (63rd), Wakefield (66th), Rotherham (68th), Kirklees (82nd), Leeds (85th), and Scarborough (97th). These areas are mostly represented by Labour MPs, with a few Conservative MPs representing parts of Leeds (with a Lib Dem MP) and North East Lincolnshire, and all of Scarborough. Apart from Scarborough, they are unitary authorities. The least deprived districts are, in descending order – Harrogate, Hambleton, Richmondshire, Craven, and Selby – all in North Yorkshire. Like all of North Yorkshire, they are represented by Conservative MPs. At county level, the least deprived areas are, in descending order – North Yorkshire, York and the East Riding of Yorkshire which all have roughly the same level of deprivation, and lower than the majority of England, including Cheshire and Northamptonshire. The region as a whole is one of the more deprived in England, measured by having far more Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in the 20% most deprived districts than the 20% least deprived districts. Kingston upon Hull has the highest proportion of NEETs in the region (and fairly high for the UK – 10.6%). This is another demographic extreme it shares with Knowsley in Merseyside. In March 2011 the region had the third highest overall unemployment claimant count in England with 4.4%. For the region, Hull has the highest rate with 7.8% which is the highest for any English district; North East Lincolnshire is next with 6.4%, and Doncaster has 5.2%. Richmondshire has the lowest rate with 1.8% and Harrogate is next lowest with 1.9%.Claimant count  In the 2015 general election, 39% of the region's electorate voted Labour, 33% Conservative, 16% UKIP, 7% Liberal Democrat and 4% Green. Labour have almost twice as many seats than the Conservatives with 33 Labour, 17 Conservative and 2 Liberal Democrat. There was a 2.5% swing from Conservative to Labour. However, although Labour has around 60% of the region's seats, the geographic spread is mostly Conservative, due to the Labour seats having a much smaller geographic area. All of South Yorkshire is Labour apart from the Liberal seat of Sheffield Hallam (the least deprived area of South Yorkshire), and Labour is concentrated in the other coalfield areas and Hull. In the Eurostat Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), Yorkshire and the Humber is a level-1 NUTS region, coded "UKE", which is subdivided as follows:  As part of the national transport planning system, the Regional Assembly is required to produce a Regional Transport Strategy (RTS) to provide long-term planning for transport in the region. This involves region wide transport schemes such as those carried out by the Highways Agency and Network Rail.  Within the region the local transport authorities plan for the future by producing Local Transport Plans (LTP) which outline their strategies, policies and implementation programmes.   The most recent LTP is that for the period 2006–11. In the Yorkshire and The Humber region the following transport authorities have published their LTP online: East Riding of Yorkshire U.A.,  Kingston upon Hull,  North East Lincolnshire U.A.,  North Lincolnshire U.A.,  North Yorkshire,  South Yorkshire,  West Yorkshire  and York U.A.   The M62 motorway is Yorkshire's main east-west thoroughfare, and north-south routes are the M1 and the A1, with only the A1 continuing further north, with an upgrade to motorway status currently being built between Dishforth and Leeming. The other main north-south road in the region is the A19. The M180 (continuing as the A180) connects the ports at Grimsby and Immingham via the M18 (European route E22). The A64 road connects areas in the North East of the region to the main body of motorways. The M1 was originally designed to finish at the A1 at Doncaster; this section became the M18. The section from the Thurcroft Interchange to Leeds was essentially designed to replace the A61, which is still the main road that connects the centres of Sheffield, Barnsley, Wakefield and Leeds, and continues through Harrogate and Ripon to Thirsk. The M180 is shadowed by the A18, which is the main road through Scunthorpe. The single-carriageway A1079 connects Hull to York, and has been exceeding its designed capacity for many years. The main north-south and east-west routes interchange at a series of junctions to the south and east of Leeds, near Castleford. Leeds and Bradford have inner-city urban motorways, while Sheffield has the Sheffield Parkway and Hull has the Clive Sullivan Way (A63) which connect the city centres with the motorway network.  Leeds has an inner-ring road network made mostly out of purpose-built motorway stretches which is mostly sub-terrain to the north of the city centre. Bradford, Huddersfield, Sheffield and York have inner-ring roads made by re-aligning existing roads while Halifax has a town-centre relief scheme made up of the Aachen Way and the North Bridge flyovers. The Humber Bridge, the tallest bridge in the UK at 538&nbsp;feet, was the world's longest suspension bridge from 17 July 1981 until 5 April 1998. It was built to connect with a proposed new town near the A15/M180 interchange.  The central hubs of the rail network in the region are Leeds, Sheffield and York. The East Coast Main Line passes through Leeds and York, operated by Virgin Trains East Coast which is based in York. The Midland Main Line finishes at Sheffield, with a less regular service to Leeds, operated by East Midlands Trains. East-west routes are the North TransPennine to Manchester, and South TransPennine through Doncaster.    Leeds has a fairly extensive commuter network and an electrified section in the North of Bradford provides many commuter services. Sheffield has a smaller commuter rail network and there are also less extensive systems in Doncaster, Huddersfield, Wakefield and Harrogate, which connect the districts of the settlements to the centre by rail. The express service between Leeds and Huddersfield is notably quick. SYPTE and WYPTE subsidise commuters' travel with discount schemes. Tram-trains have also been proposed in the area. However, no scheme has yet been approved. Hull is now connected to the capital with its much-improved Hull Trains service. North Yorkshire has a skeleton train network, with Scarborough and York being the main destinations. The Yorkshire Coast Line connects Hull to Scarborough. The Hull to York Line runs along the north of the Humber through Selby, and takes in Sherburn-in-Elmet and nearby rural stations south of York, being of great use to commuters to York since being reopened in the 1980s.  South of the Humber, Scunthorpe and nearby rural stations are connected by the South Humberside Main Line, run by Northern Rail. Grimsby is connected (also through Scunthorpe) on First TransPennine Express's South TransPennine route from Sheffield (originating at Manchester Airport). The region is home to a rail land speed record. On 1 November 1987, a British Rail HST travelled at 238&nbsp;km/h between Northallerton and Thirsk. The train consisted of power cars 43102 (City of Wakefield)City of Wakefield train and 43159, and three Mark 3 carriages. This is the world speed record for diesel trains, which used the Paxman Valenta engine.HST record  Only Sheffield has its own mass-transit system, the Supertram, owned by SYPTE and run by Stagecoach. Leeds and Bradford have more developed commuter rail systems but lack any mass transit system.  The Leeds Supertram was an approved scheme in Leeds. However, the funding was pulled and the scheme has been replaced by the proposed Leeds Trolleybus scheme.  In the past Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Kingston upon Hull, Leeds, Rotherham, Sheffield and York have all had mass-transit systems.  Airports in the region are Leeds Bradford International Airport at Yeadon, Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield (which opened in April 2005 on the former RAF Finningley) near Doncaster and Humberside Airport (which opened in April 1974 on the former RAF Kirmington) near Brigg in North Lincolnshire.  Leeds Bradford International Airport is the largest in the region by passenger numbers, Robin Hood boasts the longest runway (2.7&nbsp;km) of any airport in the region and Humberside Airport boasts an active heliport. Sheffield Airport formerly served the city of Sheffield. However, the airport struggled to attract many scheduled services and closed following the opening of Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield Airport. Lying outside of the region Durham Tees Valley Airport (former RAF Middleton St. George) serves the northernmost areas of the region, being next to the River Tees, and less than a mile from Over Dinsdale on North Yorkshire's northern edge. There are day and night direct rail connections from the region to Manchester Airport.   National Express coach services also run directly to London Heathrow Airport from the region.  Hull has daily ferries (former North Sea Ferries) to Zeebrugge and Rotterdam (Europoort).    Hull also has a large freight port and an active fishing port. Immingham carries much freight transport via DFDS Tor Line and the Stena Line. Goole is Britain's most inland port and is used mostly for importing commodities such as coal and timber. The region also has a canal network.  The Leeds and Liverpool Canal links West Yorkshire with the North West and the Aire and Calder Navigation links Leeds and the coal fields of West and North Yorkshire with the ports to the East of the region.  There are also several smaller canals in the region, often built for quite specific purposes.  Many stretches of the smaller canals in the region have been backfilled.  Until 2011Yorkshire Forward was the Regional Development Agency charged with improving the Yorkshire and Humber economy, where some 270,000 businesses contribute to an economy worth in excess of £80&nbsp;billion. With over 5&nbsp;million people living in the region it ranks alongside some small countries including Ireland, Greece, Norway and Singapore. The region has the second lowest rate of GVA in England. However, Leeds has a much higher average GVA than most of South Yorkshire. Business Link YorkshireBusiness Link Yorkshire is on the Capitol Business Park in Dodworth, west of the M1 near Barnsley near the bypass (A628). The region's Manufacturing Advisory Service is at Manufacturing Advisory Service is in Potternewton next to Chapel Allerton Hospital, on the former A61, with two other offices at the Advanced Manufacturing Park, Catcliffe off the A630 Sheffield Parkway, and also on St. Georges Road in the west of Hull. NHS Yorkshire and the Humber, the regional strategic health authority, is at the roundabout at the bottom of Kirkstall Road in Leeds, with another office ion the north of Sheffield. The charity-funded Yorkshire Air Ambulance is based at Leeds Bradford Airport and Bagby, near Thirsk. The state-funded Yorkshire Ambulance Service is based next to Coca-Cola on the Wakefield 41 Business Park, near the A650. Yorkshire in the past has been synonymous with coal mining. Many pits closed in the 1990s, with only two in the Pontefract area left at Kellingley and Sharlston. In South Yorkshire, there is Maltby Main Colliery and Hatfield Colliery at Stainforth. The NUM was very Yorkshire-dominated. Coal still plays a part in the economy – there are three large power stations along the Aire Valley, with Drax being the second largest in Europe with 3,945&nbsp;MW of capacity. The distribution area once looked after by the regional electricity company Yorkshire Electricity is now looked after by YEDL, owned by CE Electric UK.  Scunthorpe is where steel is smelted by Tata Steel Europe (former Corus Group before September 2010) in the east of the town; it is the largest steelworks in the UK. Golden Wonder crisps are made in Frodingham, opposite the steel works (former site of Riley's Potato Crisps); also Esca Food Solutions (another plant was in Milton Keynes before October 2007) make all the beef patties for McDonald's in the UK and Ireland at their factory in Crosby in the north-west of the town, processing around 7000 cattle a week – about 12,000&nbsp;kg an hour. TSC Foods on the Queensway Ind Estate at the A18/A1029 roundabout in south-east Scunthorpe supply many foodservice products (sauces) to most UK pub chains. Caparo Merchant Bar, next to steel works in Scunthorpe, are the UK's largest producer of merchant bar; nearby is Tata Steel Wire Rod. VTS Track Technology (former Corus Cogifer before 2012), a joint venture of Vossloh Cogifer (of Reichshoffen) and Tata (former Corus Rail), make railway points to the west of Scunthorpe. Pipers Crisps are on a former airfield next to the A15 at Elsham. There are two large oil refineries west of Immingham, owned by ConocoPhillips (Jet) and Total. Kimberly-Clark made all of its Huggies nappies for Europe at Barton-upon-Humber until 2013. Techrete on the B1207 in the north of Hibaldstow, next to the railway line, is the UK's leading maker of architectural precast cladding.  Grimsby is home of England's fishing industry (although most fish is transported from the Peterhead area of Scotland via road), and has many frozen food factories such as Young's Bluecrest. HMRC in the town centre administers the UK's deregistration of VAT for companies, and the VAT Annual Accounting Scheme. Auto-Trail makes motorhomes on the Europarc, Grimsby, owned by Paris-based Trigano. Wyndeham Gait is a main printer next to the A180/A16 roundabout. Cofely Fabricom Engie (former GDF SUEZ), an engineering consultancy based on the A1173 in Immingham, work in the oil and gas industry, and nearby to the east is a large Knauf plaster board plant. Hydro Agri had an important large fertiliser plant (built by Fisons in 1951) on the side of the railway; now PB Kent and its subsidiary Humber Palmers (both owned by Origin Enterprises of Ireland) make fertiliser there. In Healing (former Little Coates) next to the Humber, Lenzing Fibers Grimsby make Lyocell (Tencel), where it was first made by Courtaulds in 1988, who owned the site until bought by AkzoNobel in 1998; next door is BASF Performance Products (former Ciba). Nearby to south off the A1136/A180 junction is Europarc, also in Healing, where Kerry Group mothballed its frozen food factory in 2012; further to east in the former Little Coates is Novartis, Dunlop Oil & Marine (owned by Contitech, who make rubber hose). Greenergy have a biodiesel plant at Immingham West Terminal. There is a BP chemical works at Saltend in Hull, and Ineos Enterprises produces vinyl acetate monomer. Croda International, the chemical company, is in East Cowick. Smith & Nephew (wound management division) and Reckitt Benckiser medical and household products companies originated in Hull, and still have large factories there. When Reckitt & Colman merged with the Dutch Benckiser in 1999, much production was moved from Hull to Swindon. Heron Frozen Foods is based there near St Andrew's Quay, and Cranswick plc are a food-processing company based in the north of Hull, which makes up-market (Taste the Difference) sausages for Tesco and Sainsbury's. Aunt Bessie's is a large food company in the west of Hull near the A63 and Hessle. Nearby Norbert Dentressangle claim to run the largest pea processing factory in the worldWorld's largest pea processing factory  at the junction of the A1166 and the Clive Sullivan Way (A63), which now supplies all of Birds Eye's peas. Ideal Standard, the plumbing company, now in north Hull next to the Yorkshire Coast Line, was formed in Hull in 1936. Ideal Heating, owned by Stelrad and based nearby, make domestic boilers, and have diversified into air source heat pumps and solar thermal water heaters. Comet, who originated there, had some main offices on George Street.

The schools in each authority are listed in the following – Schools are mostly comprehensive, with some grammar schools in North Yorkshire, Calderdale and Kirklees.   There are around 235,000 at the region's secondary schools, the 4th lowest for English regions. The region has the highest overall truancy rate in England for both urban and rural areas. Inside the region for districts, Leeds has the highest rate with 6.9% persistent truants at secondary school, then Hull is second with 6.3%. Calderdale has the lowest truancy rate for unitary authorities, almost half that of Leeds, followed by North Lincolnshire. For districts Craven has the lowest rate. The schools in Hull have often performed among the worst (on average) in England at GCSE   after Knowsley in Merseyside. To Hull's credit, three schools in its LEA get above-average GCSE results whereas Knowsley usually has none (it managed two in 2010). Also at GCSE, schools in Barnsley and Bradford have low-achieving results with Barnsley the worst of these, and the lowest in the region in 2010. All three of these areas coincidentally have an above-average teenage pregnancy problem. In past years, Doncaster would be included in this group, but has managed to perform much better. For the metropolitan areas, Calderdale and Wakefield consistently perform the best, with both above the England average. Rotherham usually has the best results in South Yorkshire, but in 2010 it was Doncaster. York and North Yorkshire consistently perform the best at GCSE in the region, and with the East Riding of Yorkshire have results above the UK average.

At A-level North Lincolnshire, Kirklees, Hull, York and North Yorkshire perform quite well with Kirklees consistently being the best by a large margin and one of the highest in England, all having results above the England average. Wakefield and Calderdale were also close to the England average. The excellent Kirklees result is due to Greenhead College in Huddersfield, and North Lincolnshire's results are due to the John Leggott College, also a sixth form college. The districts of South Yorkshire perform the least in the area at A-level with Rotherham having the best results in this area, slightly below-average, and the other three districts achieve similar results, much lower than those in the former districts of Humberside.
