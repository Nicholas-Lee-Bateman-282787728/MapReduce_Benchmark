After Roland Garros, Dokic participated at Copenhagen as the seventh seed but lost to a qualifier, Galina Voskoboeva, in the first round 3–6, 1–6. Dokic then rebounded with a victory over Alla Kudryavtseva at 's-Hertogenbosch in two sets 6–0, 6–4. She then upset fourth seed Flavia Pennetta 6–3, 6–4 in the second round to avenge her loss in Dubai, ensuring her third quarterfinal appearance of the year. In the quarterfinals, Dokic faced Swede Johanna Larsson whom she dispatched 7–6, 6–4, setting up a semi-final berth against Romina Oprandi, who had upset World No. 2 Kim Clijsters in the second round. She won the match 6–4, 2–0 (retire) to ensure her second final appearance of the year against Roberta Vinci. Dokic was edged out in three close sets, 7–6, 3–6, 5–7. Despite the loss, Dokic's run to the final ensured that for the first time since October 2004, she will be ranked in the Top 50 – at world no. 45.WTA ´S-HERTOGENBOSCH – Vinci denies Dokic to win title. Tennisworldusa.org (19 June 2011). Dokic's next tournament was Wimbledon where she lost to sixth seed Francesca Schiavone in the first round 4–6, 6–1, 3–6 despite being a favourite to upset. She also participated in doubles, partnering with Bojana Jovanovski but fell to third seed Liezel Huber and Lisa Raymond in the first round. Dokic's next scheduled tournament was Budapest, but she decided to withdraw to recover from a hamstring injury. The same injury forced her to withdraw from the tournament in Bad Gastein and Baku as well. Dokic then participated in Washington as the fourth seed, but her lack of match play saw her fall in the first round to China's Zhang Shuai. She played in San Diego, but was defeated in three tight sets to Ayumi Morita with her 15 double faults being highlighted as the main concern for the match. Since then, Dokic did not play any further matches due to a shoulder injury. Despite this setback, Dokic took part in the main draw of the US Open. She reached the second round but lost to Jelena Janković in straight sets. On 27 September, Dokic went back to Belgrade, Serbia, and reconciled with her father.Jelena Dokić: Moja najbolja odluka u životu | Mondo. Mondo.rs (10 June 2010).

She began her campaign by defeating Anna Chakvetadze in the first round 6–2, 6–1. In the second round, she met Bartoli for the second time in two weeks. Unfortunately, Dokic's nine double faults (some at crucial points) cost her and lost 6–3 6–2. Despite that loss, Dokic stated she had played much better than in Sydney. She also participated in doubles and mixed doubles competitions, partnering with Kateryna Bondarenko and Paul Hanley respectively, but lost in the first rounds of both.
