 The Florida–Georgia football rivalry is an American college football rivalry game played annually by the University of Florida Gators and the University of Georgia Bulldogs.  The game was first played in 1915, and has been played every season since 1926, with the sole exception of a war-time interruption in 1943.  This match-up between Southeastern Conference opponents is one of the most prominent rivalry games in college football, and has been held in Jacksonville, Florida since 1933, with only two exceptions, making it one of the few remaining neutral-site rivalries.  The game attracts huge crowds to Jacksonville, and the associated tailgating and other events earned it the nickname of the "World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party". The two universities do not agree on when the rivalry began.  The University of Georgia's athletic department counts a 1904 match its football squad played against a team from a school known as the University of Florida.2011 Georgia Football Media Guide, University of Georgia Athletic Department, Athens, Georgia, pp. 157 & 158 (2011).  Retrieved August 19, 2011.  The game was held in Macon, Georgia, and Georgia won 52&ndash;0.  However, this was not the modern University of Florida in Gainesville, but one of its four predecessor institutions: a school previously known as Florida Agricultural College, based in Lake City.Florida Agricultural College was founded as the state's land-grant college in 1884, and pursuant to an act of the Florida Legislature was known as the "University of Florida" from 1903 until it was abolished by the legislature's passage of the Buckman Act in 1905, which merged it and three other schools into the modern University of Florida.

UGA sports historian Dan Magill sums up Georgia's attitude: "That's where Florida was back then. We can't help it if they got run out of [Lake City]." The first game acknowledged by both schools was held in Jacksonville in 1915.  The rivalry has been renewed annually since 1926, except for the 1943 season when Florida did not field a team due to World War II."The rivalry: Florida vs. Georgia," CBS Sports (undated 2001).  Retrieved August 20, 2011.  For most of its history, the game has been played at neutral sites.  From 1916 to 1932, it was played at several sites in Georgia (Athens and Savannah), and Florida (Tampa, Gainesville, and Jacksonville).College Football Data Warehouse, Florida vs. Georgia.  Retrieved August 19, 2011.  Every year since 1933, the game has been held in Jacksonville, except for 1994 and 1995, when the contest was held at the respective schools' campus stadiums due to the reconstruction of what is now EverBank Field for the National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars expansion team.Stewart Verney, "Money, not tradition keeps Florida&ndash;Georgia game in Jacksonville," Jacksonville Business Journal (October 5, 2010).  Retrieved August 20, 2011. The stadium was not available for play in 1994 due to construction, so that year's game was played in Gainesville, FL. In 1995 the stadium was available (and was used by the Jacksonville Jaguars for their ten home games), but for fairness, the 1995 game was played in Athens, GA. The game has often had championship implications, with both teams competitive in the Southeastern Conference. Florida, which did not win the SEC title until 1991, had its hopes dashed several times by a loss to Georgia in Jacksonville. The game took on new importance when the SEC split into Eastern and Western Divisions in 1992, with both Florida and Georgia in the Eastern Division. As the two teams have frequently led the division, the game has often effectively determined who will represent the Eastern Division in the SEC Championship Game. To date, Florida has ten Eastern Division titles while Georgia has five. While the two universities agree that Georgia leads the overall series, they disagree as to the overall series record due to the disputed 1904 game. As of the 2014 contest, Georgia leads with a 50&ndash;41&ndash;2 record by its reckoning, and 49&ndash;41&ndash;2 by Florida's count. Georgia dominated the series before 1951 and had a 15-5 record in the 1970s and 1980s. Florida compiled an 18-3 record against Georgia from 1990 to 2010.

Retrieved August 20, 2011. In past years, fans from Florida and Georgia were assigned seats grouped in alternating sections of the stadium, and the contrasting colors worn by the fans (red and black for Georgia, orange and blue for Florida) created a "beach ball" visual effect in the stands.  Recently the seating arrangement has split the stadium lengthwise and fans sit on the side corresponding to the sideline their team occupies.  Before the game, festivities and partying takes place at the Jacksonville Landing, a riverfront plaza facing the St. Johns River. The game is one of the busiest annual events in downtown Jacksonville, and attracts huge crowds that congregate around the stadium for tailgating and other happenings.  As a result the game and associated revelry have been known as "the World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party", a nickname first coined in the 1950s by Bill Kastelz, sports editor for The Florida Times-Union.Michael DiRocco, "Georgia&ndash;Florida game needs a name and a trophy," The Florida Times-Union (October 28, 2010).  Retrieved February 21, 2012.  Kastelz claimed he came up with the name after seeing a drunk, stumbling fan offer an alcoholic beverage to an on-duty police officer.  The "Cocktail Party" nickname proved so popular that the City of Jacksonville used it for many years.  However, the city dropped it from most official usage in 1988 following a series of alcohol-fueled outbursts. In 1984, Florida fans stormed the field and tore down the goal posts after a 27&ndash;0 victory; the following year, a 24&ndash;3 Georgia win led Bulldogs fans to do the same, ultimately resulting in 65 arrests.  Thereafter, the city cracked down on excessive drinking and soon dropped its use of the name.  In 2006 both schools and the Southeastern Conference asked CBS and the city to abandon the name in promotions due to concerns about alcohol abuse by students and other attendees.  As a result, the rivalry has lacked an official name.  It is generally called the "Florida&ndash;Georgia game" in Florida, or "Georgia&ndash;Florida game" in Georgia; some entities, including the Jacksonville newspaper The Florida Times-Union, rotate the name each year to list the designated home team first.Mike Clark, "Dear reader advocate," The Florida Times-Union (October 28, 2001).

Unlike many college sports rivalries, the Florida&ndash;Georgia game historically has not been played for a trophy. The city of Jacksonville announced that it would award the winning teams the goal posts from the game in 1986, in order to persuade fans not to storm the field and destroy them as they had the previous two years.  However, no goal posts were ever given out as neither university wanted them. In 2009, the student governments of the two universities announced the creation of a new trophy, the "Okefenokee Oar".Carolyn Crist, "SGAs begin new tradition," The Red and Black (October 29, 2009).  Retrieved August 20, 2011.

The Oar was carved from the remains of a 1,000-year-old cypress tree that once grew in the Okefenokee Swamp, which straddles the Florida&ndash;Georgia border and was the source of an interstate boundary dispute.  Beginning with the 2009 contest, the Okefenokee Oar is presented to the winning university's student body president.Nathan Crabbe, "New to Fla.-Ga.: the 'Okefenokee Oar' to the winner," The Gainesville Sun (October 28, 2009).

No trophy is presented at the game, however. By playing the game at a neutral site, rather than on their respective campuses, both universities' athletic programs derive more revenue from the game than if the site rotated on a "home-and-away" basis.  As of the 2009 contest, the universities made $1.7 million every year, or $3.4 million every two years, as opposed to an expected $2.2 million every two years if the game were played at their respective home stadiums.  The game weekend is also extremely lucrative for Jacksonville businesses, particularly in the downtown area, with many reporting that it is their busiest weekend of the year. Some persons associated with the University of Georgia, including former head coach Mark Richt, have expressed interest in moving the game away from Jacksonville periodically or entirely.Tim Tucker, "UGA weighs moving Florida game . . . but where?," The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (May 17, 2009).  Retrieved August 20, 2011.  The most frequently cited reason is Georgia's 5&ndash;18 win-loss record in the series since 1990, leading to questions about whether Jacksonville, located  from Athens but only  from Gainesville, is truly a neutral site.  As such, some Georgia fans and officials have suggested moving the game to the home stadiums, or playing alternately on the campuses, in Jacksonville, and in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia every four years.  Others, such as former Georgia athletic director Damon Evans, have dismissed the idea that Georgia's recent losing record is due to the game being played in Jacksonville.  University of Florida officials maintain that it makes financial sense to keep the game in Jacksonville; both universities stand to lose revenue if the game were played on a standard "home-and-away" basis.  Furthermore, as a proposed alternate site, the Georgia Dome seats 13,000 fewer spectators than EverBank Field.  In 2009, Georgia's athletic board unanimously agreed to a six-year contract to keep the game in Jacksonville through 2016.Tim Tucker, "UGA&ndash;UF game to stay in Jacksonville," The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (September 23, 1009).  Retrieved August 20, 2011. As with most rivalries, there have been a number of close games over the years, often generating controversy and anguish over how the game ended for one of the teams involved.  Like the series itself, most of the early memorable games favored the Bulldogs, with more recent ones favoring the Gators.  Among the most memorable: Georgia's Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) champion "ten second backfield" and powerful line of 1920 rolled up a large, 56&ndash;0 score on the Gators. Florida put up a hard fight until Georgia got its first touchdown across, pouring it on from there. Georgia running back Sheldon Fitts was the star of the contest. When Charlie Bachman became the 1928 Gators' new head coach, he inherited a team loaded with talent recruited by his predecessor.Tom McEwen, The Gators: The Story of Florida Football, The Strode Publishers, Huntsville, Alabama, pp. 82&ndash;103 (1974).  It was, however, a team that had never beaten the Georgia Bulldogs in six previous meetings, and had been out-scored by a total of 190&ndash;6 in those games.  Bachman's Gators changed history; led by All-American end Dale Van Sickel and the "Phantom Four" backfield of Carl Brumbaugh, Rainey Cawthon, Clyde Crabtree and Royce Goodbread, they decisively defeated the 'Dawgs 26&ndash;6 in Savannah, Georgia.  In an era before national polling, the 1928 Gators outscored their opponents 336&ndash;44, set a single-season national scoring record, and finished 8&ndash;1. The game was tied  6&ndash;6 in the second quarter. A 16-yard touchdown run by Crabtree starting around right end, then reversing field, broke the tie. Brumbaugh converted the extra point. A touchdown pass reception by end Van Sickel of more than 30 yards provided another score in the third period, followed by Brumbaugh's extra point kick.  To close the third quarter, fullback Cawthon made a 40-yard broken field run.  On the first play of the fourth quarter, Crabtree passed to Brumbaugh for another score, but Brumbaugh's extra point attempt was blocked by the Bulldogs. In the middle of the fourth quarter, Gator fans rushed the field to tear down the goal posts, and fist fights broke out between Georgia and Florida fans.  The 1929 Gators upset the Bulldogs for the second year in a row, by a score of 18 to 6.  Georgia had already defeated Yale. A long pass from Red Bethea to Green started things going in the second quarter, down to Georgia's 14-yard line. After driving down to the 3, Bethea scored on a wide end run. Dale Van Sickel recovered a blocked punt in the third quarter inside the 30-yard line.  Rainey Cawthon and company drove the ball inside the 10-yard line. A pass from Clyde Crabtree to Van Sickel got a touchdown. Crabtree later returned an interception for a touchdown. In the final minutes, Ed Sauls ran 60 yards through the Georgia defense, the highlight of the contest. Georgia quarterback Austin Downes broke his arm during the game. Florida running back Royce Goodbread also suffered an injury. The 1930 Gators fought the Bulldogs to a scoreless tie,  providing the upset of the conference that week,  as Georgia had once again defeated Yale and would lose just two games: to conference co-champions Alabama and Tulane. Sportswriter Lawrence Perry attributed Georgia's inability to score to its lack of using the forward pass at key intervals.  Florida would only win three of the next twenty games in the series against Georgia. The Gators snapped a 7-game losing streak by beating Georgia 6&ndash;0 in Jacksonville; Florida's first ever shutout of Georgia. In the second period, Georgia's Billy Mims attempted to punt. Florida's Charley Krejcier broke through the line and blocked the punt with his stomach. Clifford Whiddon, Gator end, picked it up, broke two tackles, and ran for the decisive touchdown. Walter Mayberry ran for 83 yards and provided long punts. Florida students rushed the field and tore down the goal posts. Prior to 1937, Georgia leads the series by a combined 13-2-1; from 1937 on Florida leads by 39-36-1. Frank Sinkwich led the nation in rushing and helped the Bulldogs to a 19&ndash;3 victory over the Gators despite a broken jaw he suffered in an automobile accident, including a 22-yard touchdown run and the Bulldogs first field goal since 1924. Having lost most upper-class players to service in World War II, the 1942 Florida Gators brought an inexperienced 3&ndash;4 squad into Jacksonville for the 1942 contest with Georgia.Ryan Ferguson, "It's Still Important to Hate Georgia: A History Lesson," AolNews.com (October 27, 2006).  Retrieved August 20, 2011.  The Bulldogs, on the other hand, still had many veteran players thanks to the draft deferments of the players who were enrolled in the University of Georgia's ROTC program, and brought a 7&ndash;0 record and No. 1 ranking to Jacksonville.

But there were still stars and bright moments; Wolf's 1949 Florida Gators were led by senior lineman Jimmy Kynes and running back Chuck Hunsinger.Associated Press, "Hunsinger Scores 3 Times; Gators Play Inspired Ball," The Gainesville Sun (November 6, 1949).  Given little chance by anyone to beat coach Wally Butts' Georgia Bulldogs in Jacksonville, Kynes inspired his two-way linemen to their outstanding effort of the season, stopping the Bulldogs' running game on defense, and blocking for Hunsinger on offense.F. T. MacFeely, "Fighting Gators Upset Georgia, 28 to 7," St. Petersburg Times, p. 29 (November 6, 1949).  Retrieved August 23, 2011.  Hunsinger rushed eighteen times for 174 yards and three touchdowns, and the Gators won 28&ndash;7, breaking a seven-game Georgia winning streak.  Wolf's overall coaching record doomed his four-year tenure in Gainesville, but on that day he was carried from the field by his players. Prior to the game, the Gators suffered a bad loss to Vanderbilt, and had only beaten the Bulldogs once in the past 10 years.  Quarterback Rick Casares was moved to fullback and replaced by Doug Dickey. Casares had  been recruited by Georgia, but upon meeting coach Butts felt he was too rough with his players, and attended Florida instead.Golenbock, Go Gators!, p. 64 Georgia has 24 victories before 1952, and just 25 since. Led by Casares on offense and Florida's second-ever first-team All-American, Charlie LaPradd, on defense, the Gators dominated the Bulldogs 30–0 in Jacksonville, which would remain the Gators' largest victory over the Bulldogs for almost forty years, and was the first shutout over the Bulldogs since 1937. Dickey played well. Casares scored two touchdowns, three extra points, and a field goal; and halfback Buford Long ran for 116 yards on 10 carries. Despite Georgia's overall advantage in the series, Florida enjoyed a 10&ndash;2 streak from 1952 to 1963 under head coaches Bob Woodruff and Ray Graves.  That changed with the arrival of Vince Dooley as the new head coach of the underdog 1964 Georgia Bulldogs.  In a game where the Bulldogs' quarterback failed to complete a single pass and was intercepted twice, Dooleys' 'Dogs relied on their running game, a staunch second-half defense, and a little bit of luck to beat Graves' tenth-ranked Florida Gators.United Press International, "Kicking Specialist Gets Winning Score," The Post and Courier, p. 4-D (November 8, 1964).  Retrieved August 20, 2011.  With the game tied at 7&ndash;7 in the fourth quarter, Bulldogs placekicker Bob Etter lined up for a potential game-winning field goal.  Instead, in a wild broken play, the Bulldogs' center and placeholder mishandled the snap, but Etter picked up the bobbled ball and ran it for a touchdown to win the game 14&ndash;7. Dooley's teams would split their first seven games 3&ndash;3&ndash;1 against Graves' Gators.  Thereafter, Dooley's 'Dogs would go on to dominate the rivalry, winning fourteen of the nineteen games from 1971 to 1989.

Wayne Barfield kicked the field goal with 34 seconds left to upset the Bulldogs 17&ndash;16.  The 1970 Florida Gators featured All-American defensive end Jack Youngblood, and he pulled off one of the most remarkable plays in Florida football history.  With Bulldogs leading 17&ndash;10 and in possession of the ball at the Gators' two-yard line, Youngblood stood up Georgia back Ricky Lake short of the goal, forced a fumble and fell on the football.  "They ran a lead play to my side, and I cut it off," Youngblood said.  "I'm standing there holding the ballcarrier and I take the ball away from him, and gave it back to our offense."  Gators quarterback John Reaves and wide receiver Carlos Alvarez then connected for two touchdown passes in the final 5:13 to rally the Florida Gators to a 24&ndash;17 victory.

The Gators' offense was led by running back Tony Green, who ran an early one-yard touchdown to put the Gators ahead 7&ndash;0.  The Gators led 7&ndash;3 as time was winding down in the fourth quarter.  Georgia's "Junkyard Dawgs" defense allowed yards between the 20-yard-lines, but ceded little ground in the red zone.  The Bulldogs set up at their own 20-yard-line with 3:10 remaining, and head coach Vince Dooley did something he rarely did: he called a trick play.  Tight end Richard Appleby accepted the handoff on a reverse to the right, but instead of running downfield, he threw the ball to wide receiver Gene Washington for an improbable 80-yard touchdown play.Associated Press, "Gators can think, keep dreaming," The Tuscaloosa News, p. 13 (November 10, 1975).

Then, faced with a fourth-and-one situation at the Gators' own 29-yard-line, coach Doug Dickey decided to go for the first down rather than punt.  Gators running back Earl Carr was stopped short by Bulldogs safety Johnny Henderson.  Led by quarterback Ray Goff's game management and running back Kevin McLee's 198-yard rushing performance, the Bulldogs seized the momentum and scored three touchdowns on their way to a come-from-behind 41&ndash;27 win.

Led by quarterback Eric Zeier, the Georgia Bulldogs mounted a drive into Florida territory in the final minute and a half.  Zeier completed what appeared to be the game-tying touchdown to Jerry Jerman with five seconds remaining in the game.Associated Press, "Officials: timeout call was the right one in last Saturday's Florida&ndash;Georgia game," Sun Journal, p. 16 (November 2, 1993).

Lott was called for pass interference on the ensuing play, giving Georgia one last untimed chance to score.  Zeier's final pass fell incomplete, and the Gators won a hard-fought, but controversial 33&ndash;26 victory.Jay Stone, "Bad Call May Cost 'Dogs Bowl Berth," Calhoun Times, p. 1B (November 3, 1993).

In twelve seasons as the Gators' head coach, Steve Spurrier led them to an 11&ndash;1 record against the Bulldogs, so his departure to the NFL following the 2001 season gave Georgia fans reason to cheer.  The 2002 Bulldogs brought a perfect 8&ndash;0 record and No. 4 ranking to the annual grudge match in Jacksonville.

Upon entering the contest in the second quarter, Bulldogs quarterback DJ Shockley was intercepted by Gators safety Guss Scott, who returned it for a touchdown, giving his team a 12&ndash;7 lead after a failed two-point conversion attempt.  The Bulldogs moved the ball but could not punch it into the endzone, settling for two field goals to take a halftime 13&ndash;12 lead.  The defenses continued to dominate in the second half, until an early fourth-quarter Gator drive ended with a touchdown pass from quarterback Rex Grossman and gave Florida a 20&ndash;13 advantage.  The Georgia offense failed to score again and failed to convert a third-down in thirteen attempts as Florida held on for the upset. Georgia finished the 2002 season 13&ndash;1 and won the SEC championship, but the defeat by the Gators  cost the Bulldogs an opportunity to play for the BCS National Championship (although two undefeated teams, Ohio State and reigning national champion Miami (Fla.), met in the Fiesta Bowl). The 2007 Georgia Bulldogs are remembered for the "Gator Stomp," a first-quarter mass celebration of the entire Georgia team in the Gators' endzone after Georgia's first touchdown, a move that emotionally rallied the underdog Bulldogs.Pete Thamel, "Celebration Intensifies Georgia-Florida Rivalry," The New York Times (October 31, 2008).  Retrieved August 20, 2011.  Because of the staged celebration, Georgia received two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties and was forced to kick off from their own 8-yard line.Associated Press, "No. 19 Georgia roughs up 11th-ranked Florida 42&ndash;30," USA Today (October 28, 2007).  Retrieved August 20, 2011.  After the game, Georgia coach Mark Richt acknowledged that he ordered his team to draw an excessive celebration penalty after their first touchdown, but intended that only the eleven players on the field would celebrate, not the entire team.Antonya English, "Richt sorry for end zone party," St. Petersburg Times (October 30, 2007).  Retrieved August 20, 2011.  The motivational tactic paid off for Richt, as Knowshon Moreno ran for 188 yards and Georgia's defense sacked Gators quarterback Tim Tebow six times in a 42&ndash;30 victory.  The high-scoring game was the first in series history in which both teams scored thirty or more points. Before the 2008 Georgia-Florida game, both coaches repeatedly stated that the previous year's incident would have no bearing on the contest.  Florida coach Urban Meyer went so far as to issue a gag order to his players, instructing them not to talk about the 2007 game with the media.Associated Press, "Meyer issues gag order concerning Georgia's 'Gator Stomp' celebration," ESPN (October 27, 2008).

Retrieved April 2, 2010.  The Gators went on to win the SEC Championship Game and the BCS Championship Game that season. In an apparent response to the Bulldogs' endzone celebration of the previous year, Meyer used both of his remaining timeouts with less than a minute to play, giving his team and fans more time to celebrate the victory.  After the game, he broke his pre-game silence on the 2007 celebration.  "Was it motivation for our players?  Yeah, it was."Mark Schlabach, "Gators send many messages in revenge rout of Georgia," ESPN (November 1, 2008).  Retrieved August 20, 2011. The Bulldogs were able to hold on late against the Gators, beating their SEC East archrival by a score of 17-9 and turning in their best performance of the season. The two teams combined for nine turnovers and 24 penalties. Todd Gurley, who starred for Georgia, rushed for 119 yards and scored the game's only two touchdowns. Down by 8 points in the 4th Quarter, the Gators were driving against what seemed like an unstoppable Georgia defense all game. The Gators were able to get deep into Bulldog territory with a chance to tie the game. Junior Jordan Reed was sprinting for the endzone after a reception from Gators quarterback Jeff Driskel, but the Bulldogs' Jarvis Jones punched the ball out of his hands and the team was able to recover. It was Florida's sixth and final turnover that potentially cost the No. 2 team in the nation a chance to play in the SEC Championship game, and possibly the 2013 BCS National Championship Game."No. 10 Bulldogs force six turnovers, upset No. 2 Gators," ESPN.com (October 28, 2012).
