    John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan (born 8 May 1947) is a British Labour Party politician. He was a Member of Parliament from 1987 to 2010, and served in the Cabinet under Prime Minister Tony Blair in a number of positions. He was Health Secretary from 2003 to 2005, Defence Secretary from 2005 to 2006, and Home Secretary from 2006 to 2007. Born in Bellshill to working class, Roman Catholic parents, Reid first became involved in politics when he joined the Young Communist League in 1972. He later joined the Labour Party, working for them as a senior researcher before being elected to the House of Commons in 1987 as the MP for Motherwell North. He retired from front-line politics in 2007 following Gordon Brown's appointment as Prime Minister, taking on a role as the Chairman of Celtic Football Club. He later stepped down as an MP in 2010, and was elevated to the House of Lords. Reid also took a leading role in the campaign for a 'No' vote in the 2011 AV referendum, appearing alongside David Cameron. and has taken a leading role in the campaign against Scottish independence. Reid was born in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, to working class Roman Catholic parents; his grandparents were of mixed denomination. His grandfather was "a staunch Church of Scotland Presbyterian and his grandmother a poor and illiterate Irish peasant."John Reid: The Blairite bruiser The Independent, 27 January 2001 His mother, Mary, was a factory worker and father, Thomas, was a postman with a passionate belief in education being the means of liberating the working classes. Reid attributes his success to hard work and a good education. Like his successor as Scottish Secretary, Helen Liddell he attended St Patrick's Secondary School, Coatbridge. The headmaster of St Patrick's, James Breen, was described as being driven by the belief that working class children could make good in their lives provided there was discipline. The teenage Reid showed an early talent for organisation and political activism by leading a strike in protest at a school rule that forced children who arrived early to school to wait outside in all weathers, including the bitter cold and wet winters. "If we weren't allowed in before 9 o'clock, we weren't going in after 9 o'clock" Reid is quoted as saying. Eventually the Headmaster conceded and the strike ended. Leaving school at 16, Reid decided not to go to university but instead took a series of jobs, including construction work on an oil pipeline and another in insurance. It is this latter job that Reid quotes as opening his eyes politically. He was assigned to the tenements of the East End of Glasgow after the city was hit by storms in late 1968 and saw poverty of a sort he did not know existed: a sick infant sleeping in a wooden box, in a damp-ridden room, a distracted old woman buying coal for a tenement flat that had no coal fire. Soon after this he joined the Labour Party. It was also around this time that Reid's lifelong passion for history was kindled when his girlfriend (and later wife), Cathie McGowan, bought him a copy of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer. Reid was spellbound. Following this he attended the Open University in his mid-twenties to study a Foundation Course and then later attended the University of Stirling, gaining a BA in history and a PhD in economic history, with a thesis on the slave trade written as a critique of the Marxist model of historical change, entitled Warrior Aristocrats in Crisis: the political effects of the transition from the slave trade to palm oil commerce in the nineteenth century Kingdom of Dahomey.The Operator The Guardian, 2 March 2002 From 1979 to 1983 he was a research officer for the Labour Party in Scotland, and from 1983 to 1985 he was a political adviser to Labour leader Neil Kinnock. From 1986 to 1987, he was Scottish Organiser of Trade Unionists for Labour. He entered parliament at the 1987 general election as MP for the Motherwell North constituency. After boundary changes, he was returned at the 1997 election for the new constituency of Hamilton North and Bellshill; and after further boundary changes in 2005, he was returned at the 2005 election for the new constituency of Airdrie and Shotts with 59% of the vote. Reid was married to Cathie McGowan from 1969 until her sudden death from a heart attack in 1998.British Bulldog Sunday Business Post, 20 August 2006 In 2002 he married the Jewish Brazilian film director Carine Adler.Wedding bells beckon for NI secretary BBC News, 5 February 2002 According to The Guardian (23 September 2006) Reid arrived in the House of Commons "drunk one day and tried to force his way on to the floor to vote. When an attendant stepped forward to stop him, Reid threw a punch". Reid stopped drinking in 1994 and stopped smoking cigarettes in 2003.The hard-drinking, hard-smoking health secretary, Men's Health Forum, 1 February 2005 In May 2007 it was alleged that Reid had given up alcohol as a consequence of having harassed a fellow Labour MP in the early 1990s whilst drunk.The day leadership rival John Reid propositioned the young Brown ally Dawn Primarolo – and never drank again SIMON WALTERS, Mail Online, 3 May 2007 According to George Galloway, Reid is an accomplished singer and guitar player and "taught a whole generation of Labour activists, including yours truly, the entire IRA songbook". The claim about his musicianship is supported by the fact that, in January 2001, he was named an honorary member of the Scottish group "The Big Elastic Band" and promised to play guitar on their next album.Profile:Dr. John Reid BBC News, 24 October 2002 He was an early member of Labour Friends of Israel.David Blunkett to return to the Cabinet in major reshuffle The Daily Telegraph, 1 May 2005 Reid grew up in a very working class environment. He is intensely proud of his industrial working class upbringing and one of his favourite mottoes is "better a broken nose than a bended knee".Profile: John Reid Daily Telegraph, 13 June 2004 At university Reid, for a time, became a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain of which he has said: "I used to be a Communist. I used to believe in Santa Claus".Profile: John Reid – The Blairite bruiser Find Articles, 27 January 2001 The secretary of the Young Communist League, Jim White, who went to university with Reid, recalls: "He told us he was a Leninist and Stalinist. Although I was suspicious about his transition, we couldn't tell if he was acting. We let him join." On securing the support of the Communists and Labour students, Reid was able to run for president of the students' union and win the election. His political career was launched.The Dark Horse The Guardian, 23 September 2006 He moved on from Leninism after leaving university with his doctorate, and became a researcher for Scottish Labour party. Reid believes that any socialist, or indeed any rational person, should be a revisionist on principle.Profile of John Reid The Guardian, 20 March 2001 His intellectual familiarity with Marxism helped him in the early 1980s when he compared the split within Labour between the left-wing Tony Benn and Neil Kinnock as one between Bennite "quasi-Leninists", and "Luxemburgers", (named after the German revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg), who favoured the more soft-left Neil Kinnock. He lent his support to Kinnock. As an advisor to Kinnock, Reid was one of the earliest to embark on the crusade to reform and modernise the Labour Party.  In 1983, after the Labour Party's worst ever election defeat, he had, at Kinnock's request, put on a single sheet of paper what had been making Labour so unelectable for the past few years. "Leaderless, unpatriotic, dominated by demagogues, policies 15 years out of date", Reid had written. He was contemptuous of the party campaign machine which Harold Wilson had, in 1955, called a "penny-farthing". "The only difference now is that it's a rusty penny farthing. Fix all these things and you will fix the party" Reid is quoted as saying. He regards New Labour as a natural development of Bevanism. Elected to Parliament in 1987 as Member of Parliament for Motherwell North, within two years Reid was appointed to the shadow Front Bench as spokesperson for Children. In 1990 Reid was appointed a Defence spokesperson. When the former Yugoslavia was breaking up in the 1990s Reid considered it important to start a dialogue with the Bosnian Serbs. During the Bosnian War, Reid struck up a friendship with the Serb rebel leader, Radovan Karadžić, later to be indicted as a war-criminal. Reid admitted he spent three days at a luxury Geneva lakeside hotel as a guest of Karadžić in 1993. This was during the period (April 1992 – July 1995) in which the crimes for which Karadžić was indicted in 1995 were committed.The International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, case no. IT-95-5-I ICTY, July 1995 When Labour came to power in 1997 John Reid served as Minister of State for Defence. He became Minister of State for Transport in 1998. Reid held seven Cabinet posts in seven years while Tony Blair was Prime Minister: After the 1997 election, Reid was the obvious choice to become the Armed Forces Minister, where he played a key role in the then Defence Secretary George Robertson's Strategic Defence Review. Reid gained considerable praise for the review; with some commentators going so far as to describe his success in cutting military expenditure at the same time as winning over the defence chiefs as "brilliant". In 1998 Reid moved from Defence to become the Minister of Transport.The Guardian Profile: John Reid The Guardian, 12 June 2003 The Prime Minister Tony Blair then sent Reid to the Department of Transport to ensure the late-running and over-budget London Underground Jubilee Line Extension was completed by the end of 2000. He and John Prescott brought in Bechtel as Project Managers, ensuring Phase 1 was opened on 1 May 1999, and the whole Jubilee line with the exception of one station (Westminster) was ultimately open for business by the Millennium.Its New Transport Line Is Late and Over Budget : Will the New Century Get to London on Time?

The Guardian, 12 October 2000 After Donald Dewar, Scotland's respected First Minister, died in 2000 Reid's name was even mentioned as a possible replacement. In fact Reid was left to deal with much of the fall-out after the death and would be increasingly at loggerheads with the new Labour First Minister, Henry McLeish, whom Reid felt was taking the Parliament down a nationalist path. The situation became so strained between the two that in an unguarded moment McLeish publicly labelled Reid "a patronising bastard".Labours chiefs in "comments" row BBC News, 8 June 2001 John Reid became Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in January 2001 following the resignation of Peter Mandelson. He was the first Roman Catholic to hold the position.Profile: John Reid BBC News, 6 May 2007 While dismissing the personal significance of this, he used it to insist that every person in Northern Ireland, from whatever background or tradition, wanted a prosperous future. Throughout his period of office he was continually engaged in talks with all side of the community in an attempt to reduce the level of inter-community troubles.Reid bid to halt Belfast rioting BBC News, 5 June 2002 He blamed Paramilitaries from both sides of the community for on-going violence. He confronted both, on the ground, at a violent east Belfast interface, where he met loyalist residents of Cluan Place and then had talks with nationalist residents in the nearby Short Strand.Paramilitaries 'to blame' for violence BBC News, 4 September 2002 Reid ruled that ceasefires proclaimed by the Ulster Defence Association and the Loyalist Volunteer Force could no longer be recognised by the government because of their involvement in sectarian attacks and murders.Riots engulf Belfast as peace line strains ceasefire to the limit The Guardian, 5 June 2002 At the same time he put pressure on the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) to make a move on arms decommissioning to help end the political impasse, whilst acknowledging that putting its weapons beyond use would be a difficult step to take.Reid puts pressure on IRA to decommission RTÉ News, 23 September 2001 It was in this context that, in October 2001 he welcomed a Gerry Adams speech as a "highly significant" step which he hoped would pave the way for a "groundbreaking" move by the IRA to disarm which would  transform the political situation.Reid welcomes significant step The Guardian, 23 October 2001 And following the IRA's decision Reid responded by announcing the immediate demolition of British Army security bases and announcing a reduction in troop levels as the security situation improved,Reid announces NI security cuts BBC News, 24 October 2001 effectively beginning a process which culminated in September 2005, when the disarmament monitor for Northern Ireland, the Canadian General John de Chastelain announced that the IRA had given up its entire arsenal of weapons after more than three decades of armed struggle against British rule.IRA scraps all its arms CNN International, 26 September 2005 Reid oversaw the final stages of the transformation of the RUC into the Police Service Northern Ireland, and the first endorsement of the service by representatives of the Nationalist community.RUC title 'may go' by November BBC News, 21 September 2001 Political problems continued, resulting in the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly a year later in October 2002.Assembly suspended over 'loss of trust' BBC News, 14 October 2002 The peace process was to be put on hold until there was a "clear and unequivocal commitment" that the IRA would disband. Reid made an emergency statement to Parliament announcing direct rule in the interim.Blair tells Adams the IRA must disband Times Online, 11 October 2002 In the interim, Reid also had to deal with continuing domestic problems; including those with loyalist ceasefires, sectarian murders and the tinderbox of Holy Cross primary school in north Belfast (that ignited the worst rioting in the city in years). But, so far as 10 Downing Street was concerned, Reid had gone a long way to delivering the rarest of political commodities – success in Northern Ireland. Reid was appointed Chairman of the Labour Party and Minister Without Portfolio on 24 October 2002. As a purely political post his trouble-shooting skills were employed as the Labour Government's chief spokesperson earning him the nickname "Minister for the Today Programme". One of Reid's key challenges was to keep the trade unions (the Labour Party's main funders) on-side despite the antipathy shown by the Unions to many of the Government's proposals. As part of this Reid agreed to look at proposals to stop private contractors exploiting low paid workers (a key Union demand).Blair's Valentine date to patch up with the unions Times Online, 4 January 2003 In March 2003, Robin Cook resigned as Leader of the House of Commons due to his objections to the legality of Britain's involvement in the Iraq war. John Reid was appointed to take over the Office brief on 4 April as a heavyweight figure was more likely to ensure the Commons' continued support for the war. He held the position for only three months and was succeeded by Peter Hain. John Reid was made Secretary of State for Health in June 2003, replacing Alan Milburn after the latter's resignation. He was reportedly less than happy with the appointment. He was reported by Private Eye at the time as reacting "Oh fuck, not health."Private Eye, 12 June 2003; Since then, the publication has regularly included the phrase "oh fuck, not health" in any mention of his name But Reid had established himself as one of Tony Blair's most trusted ministers and his appointment as Health Secretary took him into his fourth cabinet job in less than a year. At Health Reid saw himself as a reformer, controversially increasing capacity by introducing private companies to run treatment centres for knee, hip and eye operations. He claimed this provided extra staff and extra capacity to help treat more patients in the NHS at an unprecedented rate.NHS calls in Kwik-Fit-style eye surgeons Times Online, 13 January 2004 He was severely criticised for giving GPs a 22% pay rise while allowing them to opt out of weekend and evening treatment. This was the start of a pattern whereby Reid would side with powerful bureaucratic forces in the ministries he ran. Reid also introduced plans to increase the number of smoke-free workplaces and improve diet and sexual health as part of a major drive to improve public health in EnglandJohn Reid outlines proposals to improve public health UK Government DirectGov statement and began a major public consultation as a precursor to parliamentary proposals aimed at improving the nation's health.John Reid announces consultation on public health North East Public Health Observatory He also encouraged volunteer engagement in the health service.John Reid Outlines the 'People's Potential' for strengthening the NHS Centre for Voluntary Services Many of his changes caused criticism and controversy, which Reid was not afraid to take head on, delivering a staunch defence of Labour's reform programme to the party's annual conference. He made the case for extending to all the choices normally only available to those who could afford them. E-Politix profile  Unsurprisingly he sometimes made the "Big Government" left wing of the Labour Party gasp. Reid's management style was considered autocratic by some and he came under considerable fire from National Health Service (NHS) leaders. A former director at the Department of Health criticised his style of leadership, saying: "[W]hen John Reid came in he produced a series of major policy changes without consulting people, without even sharing them at draft stage... It's not surprising, therefore, that [the NHS managers] didn't feel the same level of ownership [of the policy changes]".Catcalls, barracking and laughter force Hewitt to abandon speech The Guardian, 27 April 2006 Health Secretary John Reid tasked NHS hospitals with achieving a year on year reduction to halve the hospital superbug MRSA up to and beyond March 2008. Official rates showed year on year increases in England since measurement of MRSA bloodstream infections began in 2001. He was the first Health Minister to bring in tough challenges for hospitals to reduce healthcare associated infections. As Health Secretary, Reid had been in favour of limiting the government's proposed smoking ban as much as possible. In their 2005 election manifesto, he introduced a pledge to ban smoking in all places where food was served. His successor Patricia Hewitt favoured a complete ban. Reid won in the cabinet, gaining an exemption for private clubs and pubs that did not serve food.Cabinet agrees England smoking ban BBC News, 25 October 2005 The House of Commons rebels proposing a complete ban were successful when MPs were given a free vote on the issue.

Paxman later accused Reid of having a chip on his shoulder and Reid accused Paxman of class prejudice.The Guardian profile: The Scottish Raj The Guardian, 18 March 2005  Following the incumbent Labour Party's 2005 general election victory, John Reid was appointed Secretary of State for Defence. He replaced Geoff Hoon. At Defence Reid argued that "democracy, restraint and respect for the rule of law are at the core of our national beliefs… even if they create a short-term tactical disadvantage, they represent a long-term strategic advantage – by basing our actions on principle, law, morality and right".International law needs to adapt to modern conflicts says Reid The Guardian, 5 April 2006 At the same time he raised questions about "the adequacy of the international legal framework in the light of modern developments in conflict". He suggested that "the body of relevant international rules and conventions should, where beneficial, be strengthened", especially "to cope with conflict against non-state actors such as the international terrorist… this means extending, not reducing, such conventions". Reid committed 3,300 troops to Helmand province, Afghanistan in January 2006. As Secretary of State he is often misquoted as saying troops would leave "without a single shot being fired." He actually said "We would be perfectly happy to leave in three years and without firing one shot because our job is to protect the reconstruction."  By 2008, 4 million bullets had been fired by the British armed forces. Reid took an aggressive approach to defending his government's international policy. Speaking ahead of a conference on NATO modernisation in Germany on 4 February 2006, Reid asserted in a press interview that "no institution has the divine right to exist".Future of NATO at risk, says Reid BBC News, 4 February 2006 Similarly on 19 March 2006, in response to former interim Iraqi prime minister Iyad Allawi's claim that Iraq is in the grip of civil war, Reid defended the British Government's contrary view. He stated: "Every single politician I have met here [in Iraq] from the prime minister to the president, the defence minister and indeed Iyad Allawi himself said to me there's an increase in the sectarian killing, but there's not a civil war and we will not allow a civil war to develop".

The street value of the drugs would have been less than 85p. By the time of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict, Reid was no longer Defence Secretary, having been succeeded by Des Browne. On 3 February 2010, Reid gave evidence about his role as Defence Secretary to the Iraq Inquiry. Reid was appointed Home Secretary on 5 May 2006, replacing Charles Clarke after the latter was removed in the wake of a Home Office scandal involving the release of foreign national prisoners. By the time he arrived at the Home Office, Reid was seen as one of the government's most effective performers over the previous decade, being described by many commentators as a bruiser, but with a strong academic leaning. At the Home Office Reid hit the ground running. He contended that rapid global change and the associated challenges of mass migration, terrorism and organised crime had overwhelmed the outdated Home Office approach.I can fix the problems, but I need three years Daily Telegraph, 21 January 2007 Reid caused considerable controversy by attacking the leadership and management systems previously in place in the Home Office.

In June 2014 Reid appeared in a full-page advert in the Scottish Catholic Observer, encouraging readers to vote against Scottish independence in the September referendum. The advert failed to state who had paid for it, which is a breach of Electoral Commission rules, and following complaints Reid revealed that it had been paid for by an organisation led by Willie Haughey. Following the general scandal over MP expenses in 2009, Sir Thomas Legg requested £2,731.88 be repaid, but Dr Reid chose to repay a total of £7,336.51.John Reid: MPs' expenses verdict from Sir Thomas Legg STV News, 4 February 2010 A later offer to refund £4,604.63 was accepted in 2010.John Reid gets over £4,000 repaid in expenses refund Wishaw Press, 25 August 2010 On 28 September 2007, it was announced John Reid would become Chairman of Celtic Football ClubReid named as new Celtic chairman BBC News, 28 September 2007 taking over from Brian Quinn. His appointment was ratified by Celtic's shareholders on 19 November 2007. Sports journalist Graham Spiers found him "an engaging and intriguing Celtic chairman".John Reid's anti-slogan pitch is tough Times Online, 18 December 2007 Reid is a lifelong supporter of the club and described the appointment as "an honour and a privilege"Board changes at Celtic PLC Celtic FC, 28 September 2007 Additionally he holds "Like every schoolboy who supported Celtic, I always dreamed of pulling on the Hoops and scoring at Celtic Park. I never made it as a player, but this is certainly the next best thing. "It will be an honour and a privilege not only to take up this position, but also to follow in the footsteps of a man like Brian, whose reputation for integrity, achievement and commitment to Celtic is of the very highest order. He has left a proud legacy of sporting and financial success that stands comparison with anyone's and I am looking forward immensely to continuing those traditions." At Celtic's Annual General Meeting held on 29 October 2009, Reid highlighted the plight of the club's closest rivals Rangers. In response to a question on the club's spending, Reid said: "If you start getting into a position where you are running up debts that you cannot afford, spending money you don't have, it is the road not to success but to ruin. "The people who decide whether we will sell players or buy players are the management and the board, who are accountable to the fans and shareholders. Not some anonymous director of a bank." As in politics, Reid has become a controversial chairman who has gained a reputation with fans and other clubs as a confrontational figure. During the 2010–2011 SPL season, Reid is alleged to have exacerbated an already volatile situation between his club and referees after a series of decisions made by a number of Scotland's referees came under question; Reid called for one referee to be fired and that all referees should disclose their 'allegiance' (i.e. which team they support). This pressure, was a factor in the decision made by Scottish referees to take strike action. In late 2008 it was announced that John Reid would be taking up the post of honorary Professor at the University College London and become the chairman of the newly created Institute of Security and Resilience Studies (ISRS) at UCL. Of the institute Reid said: "I believe that the ISRS can play a vital role in developing innovative thinking and producing new solutions to help us all be better prepared for the demanding challenges of today's world. The resilience to withstand, recover and move on from crisis is now an issue requiring both academic study and wider understanding at all levels of society. Peoples and nations are now being put to the test, not only by the more traditional issues of conflict, wars and inter-state threats but also a range of new security issues. Countries, societies and economies that cannot develop better the capacity to prevent, resist and recover will be left vulnerable and exposed. I am delighted to be able to use my experience in this new academic endeavour".Security and resilience solutions for the 21st century: a new UCL institute University College London, 17 November 2008Mass migration threatens Britain's national security, says John Reid Daily Telegraph, 16 November 2008 On 18 December 2008 G4S (Group 4 Securicor) announced that Reid would be taking up a post with the company as Group Consultant.G4S Appoints Reid Security Oracle, 18 December 2008 Reid is currently a member of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation, established in October 2009.
