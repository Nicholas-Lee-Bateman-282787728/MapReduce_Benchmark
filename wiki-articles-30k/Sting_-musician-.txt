Both of Sting's parents died from cancer in the 1980s (his mother in 1986 and his father in 1987). He did not attend either funeral, saying the media would be disrespectful to his parents. In 1995, Sting prepared for a court appearance against his former accountant who had misappropriated several million pounds of his money. Sting owns several homes worldwide, including Lake House and its 60 acre estate near Salisbury, Wiltshire; a cottage in the Lake District; a New York City flat; a beach house in Malibu; a  estate in Tuscany, Italy; and a flat on the Mall, and an 18th-century terrace house in Highgate.   Sting ran five miles (8&nbsp;km) a day and performed aerobics. He participated in running races at Parliament Hill and charity runs. Around 1990 Danny Paradise introduced him to yoga, and he began practising Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga series, though he now practises Tantra and Jivamukti Yoga as well. He wrote a foreword to Yoga Beyond Belief, written by Ganga White in 2007. In 2008 he was reported to practise Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation technique. Sting's affinity for yoga contributed to a rumour about his sexual prowess, including a purported eight hours of sex with Styler. The story stems from an interview with Sting and Bob Geldof. A journalist asked "how do you perform in bed?" and Geldof remarked that he was a "three-minute man" but Sting could last for hours thanks to yoga. Sting played Garry Kasparov in an exhibition game in 2000, along with four bandmates: Dominic Miller, Jason Rebello, Chris Botti and Russ Irwin. Kasparov beat all five simultaneously within 50 minutes. Sting adheres to a macrobiotic diet. In 1969, Sting read the Gormenghast trilogy by Mervyn Peake and bought the film rights. He named pets, a racehorse, his publishing company, and one of his daughters (Fuchsia) after characters from the books. Sting supports his hometown Premier League football club Newcastle United, and in 2009, backed a Newcastle United Supporters' campaign against the plan of owner Mike Ashley to sell off naming rights to St James' Park. In 2011 interview in Time, Sting said: "I'm essentially agnostic. I don't have a problem with God. I have a problem with religion. I've chosen to live my life without the certainties of religious faith. I think they're dangerous. Music is something that gives my life value and spiritual solace." In August 2013, Sting donated money to The Friends of Tynemouth Outdoor Pool to regenerate the 1920s lido at the southern end of Longsands Beach in Tynemouth, a few miles from where he was born.   Sting has also ventured into acting. Film and television roles include:"About this Person - Sting". New York Times. Retrieved 14 November 2014 Sting narrated the American premiere of the musical Yanomamo (1983), by Peter Rose and Anne Conlon, outlining problems that existed in the Amazon rainforest. This was made into a film and later broadcast as Song of the Forest. He also provided the voice of Zarm on the 1990s television show Captain Planet and the Planeteers. In 1989 he starred as Macheath (Mack the Knife) in John Dexter's Broadway production of The Threepenny Opera. Sting also appeared as himself in the video game Guitar Hero World Tour.
