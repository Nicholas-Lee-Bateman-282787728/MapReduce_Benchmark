   The Nashville Sounds are a minor league baseball team of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics. They are located in Nashville, Tennessee, and are named for the city's association with the music industry. The team plays its home games at First Tennessee Park which opened in 2015 and is partially located on the former site of the historic Sulphur Dell ballpark. The Sounds previously played at Herschel Greer Stadium from its opening in 1978 until the end of the 2014 season. Established as a Double-A team of the Southern League in 1978, the Sounds were replaced by a Triple-A American Association team in 1985. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded it. The Sounds later joined the PCL in 1998. The team has served as a farm club for seven major league franchises. A total of 26&nbsp;managers have led the club and its more than 1,100&nbsp;players. As of the completion of the 2015 season, the team has played in 5,445&nbsp;regular season games and compiled a win–loss record of 2,794–2,651 (.513)."Year-By-Year Results." Minor League Baseball. Retrieved on September 7, 2015. The team fielded in 1980 was recognized as one of the 100&nbsp;greatest minor league teams of all time. The 2006 team tied the record for the longest game in PCL history. Of the three nine-inning perfect games in the history of the PCL, two have been pitched by members of the Sounds. The Sounds won the PCL Championship in 2005, sweeping the Tacoma Rainiers in three games in the final series. Previous league titles won by the team are the Southern League Championship in 1979 as the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, and again in 1982 as the Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees. Nashville's professional baseball history dates back to 1885, beginning with the Nashville Americans. They were followed by the Blues, Tigers, Seraphs, Centennials, and Vols. The city was without a professional baseball team for 14 years after the Double-A Vols ceased operations after their 1963 season. In 1978, the Nashville Sounds were added as an expansion franchise team in the Double-A Southern League. Fans responded well to the return of baseball to the city, evidenced by Nashville leading the Southern League in attendance in each of their seven seasons as a member of the league.  President and part owner Larry Schmittou, head coach of the Vanderbilt University baseball team from 1968 to 1978, was instrumental in bringing professional baseball back to Nashville. Schmittou's business philosophy revolved around earning profits not from ticket sales, but from the sale of souvenirs and concessions.Pratt, Kristin. "25 for 25: Stars in the Baseball America Universe." BaseballAmerica. July 20, 2006. Retrieved on March 24, 2008. This philosophy also involved promoting entertainment value, or fun, instead of promoting the baseball game.Traughber, Bill. "Commodore History Corner: Q&A with Larry Schmittou." College Sports Television. April 8, 2008. Retrieved on April 9, 2008. With the help of country music star Conway Twitty, who heard about the proposed team in local newspapers, Schmittou brought in other recording artists such as Larry Gatlin and Jerry Reed, as well as other Nashvillians, as Sounds shareholders.Nipper, Skip. Baseball in Nashville. Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing, 2007: 101. ISBN 978-0-7385-4391-8 The club played their home games at a new facility, Herschel Greer Stadium, located south of downtown Nashville at the foot of St. Cloud Hill in Fort Negley Park. Schmittou allowed fans to submit suggestions for the team's name. Among the finalists were Stars, Notes, Hits, and Strings.Woody, Larry. Schmittou: A Grand Slam in Baseball, Business, And Life. Nashville: Eggmann Publishing Company, 1996: 90. ISBN 1886371334 The team's name is a play on the term "Nashville sound", a subgenre of American country music that traces its roots to the area in the late-1950s. Furthermore, the wordmark and color scheme were lifted from the Memphis Sounds of the American Basketball Association (ABA), who used them for one season in 1974 before the team relocated and became the Baltimore Claws. When the ABA merged with the National Basketball Association in 1976, some of the copyrights were allowed to lapse, and Nashville's baseball team adopted the abandoned schemes.Ruble, Drew. "Vestige of Empire." Business Tennessee. July 2006. Retrieved on August 1, 2008. The color blue was added to Memphis' red and white palette. The team's original logo, which was used from 1978 to 1997, and initially sketched by Schmittou, reflects the city's association with the country music industry. It depicts a mustachioed old-time baseball player swinging at a baseball with a guitar, a staple of country music, in place of a bat. Further illustrating the city's musical ties is the typeface, with letters resembling musical notes, used to display the team name. A minor league ice hockey team also owned by Schmittou from 1981 to 1984, the Nashville South Stars, used a nearly-identical (albeit hockey-themed) wordmark and logo as the Sounds, except with green and gold colors to match its affiliated NHL club, the Minnesota North Stars.  As the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, the Sounds played their first home game, a 12–4&nbsp;victory, on April 26, 1978 against the Savannah Braves in front of a sellout crowd of 8,156&nbsp;fans.Traughber, Bill. "Looking Back: Sounds' First Game." Nashville Sounds. August 7, 2006. Retrieved on March 8, 2008. The home opener was scheduled to take place the previous evening, but was rained out. The team requested to open the season on the road and had to swap a series with the Chattanooga Lookouts in order to have enough time to complete the stadium. Tractors and grading machines were still preparing the field on game day, and the electricity was turned on only five minutes before the gates opened. The sod, which arrived late, was laid the day before the scheduled opening game with the help of an estimated group of 50&nbsp;fans who heard an announcement from general manager Farrell Owens on local radio stations inviting them to a "sod party". As the Double-A affiliate of the Reds, the Sounds finished ninth during their inaugural campaign of 1978, but led all of minor league baseball in attendance by drawing 380,000&nbsp;fans. Under manager George Scherger, the Sounds started the 1979 season poorly, before rallying to win 20 of 31&nbsp;games in late May and June. They entered the last game of the first half in first place, but lost to their cross-state rivals, the Memphis Chicks and finished in second place. The Sounds and Chicks met again on the last day of the second half in a split doubleheader; both games were won by Nashville. The two teams then faced-off in a best-of-three series to determine the Western Division champion. The Sounds won the series two games to one before advancing to the Southern League championship series against the Columbus Astros. Nashville captured the league title by defeating the Astros three games to one. Also in 1979, the team played host to the Southern League All-Star Game. The contest pitted a team of the league's all-stars against the major league Atlanta Braves. The all-stars defeated the Braves, five runs to two. Nashville's Duane Walker was named the MVP.Elliott, Jeff. "All-Star game survives years of dormancy, format changes." The Florida Times-Union. July 5, 2003. Retrieved on March 7, 2008. Originally, the Reds allowed Nashville to use a designated hitter in their lineup. However, this allowance was later revoked, as the Reds were a part of the National League which did not use a DH. President Larry Schmittou issued an ultimatum: if Cincinnati would not let them use the DH, they would not renew their contract and would look for a new major league affiliate. The Reds did not renege on their decision to prohibit the DH, so the Sounds looked for a new affiliate after 1979. Schmittou was then approached by five or six clubs looking to enter the Southern League as a Sounds affiliate. The Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming a part of the New York Yankees organization. Managers Stump Merrill and Johnny Oates and future major leaguers such as Steve Balboni, Don Mattingly, Buck Showalter, Otis Nixon, Willie McGee, Pat Tabler, and Dan Pasqua helped lead Nashville to first or second-place divisional finishes from 1980 to 1984. The 1980 Sounds finished the first half of the season one-and-a-half games behind the Memphis Chicks. In the second half, the team finished in first place, 14 games ahead of the second-place team. In the Western Division championship series, Nashville lost to Memphis, three games to one. Nine Southern League records were set during the season, the team's pitching staff led the league in ERA and strikeouts, and Steve Balboni led the league in runs, home runs, and total bases. The team also set a league attendance record, when a total of 575,676&nbsp;fans visited Greer Stadium. As of the completion of the 2014 season, this record still stands. In 2001, the 1980 Sounds were ranked as the sixty-ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians.Weiss, Bill and Marshall Wright.

During the season, manager Doug Holmquist, frustrated with the team's disappointing first half, instituted a system of fines for player infractions or poor performance on the field. The program ranged from a US$10 fine for a pitcher walking a batter with one on and two outs to a US$100 fine for missing curfew. Rebounding, Nashville won the second half pennant, earning the team a shot at the Western Division championship. The Sounds, however, lost the fifth game of the best-of-five series to the Birmingham Barons by a score of seven runs to five, ending their season.McGee, Mark. "1983 Review."

He survived, but with a bruised leg and several lacerations to the head, and he returned to play later in the season. The Southern League All-Star Game returned to Nashville in 1983. Not only did the Sounds host the event, but they also served as the all-star team's competition. The all-stars recorded the victory with a score of three runs to two. The Sounds were one game shy of winning the first half pennant in 1984. Winning the first half title is something that eluded the team during its entire seven-year span at the Double-A level. Nashville captured the second half title, however, for the sixth consecutive season, after defeating Knoxville in a playoff game. The two teams met again in the divisional playoffs, but Knoxville emerged the victor, ending the Sounds' season. One important highlight of the first half of 1984 took place on May 4, when Jim Deshaies pitched the club's first no-hitter against the Columbus Astros in the second game of a seven-inning doubleheader. The 5–1 Sounds victory was cut short of being a perfect game following three walks and a batter being hit by a pitch, advancing the runner home for the only Astros run of the game.Traughber, Bill.

In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou noticed a 5%&nbsp;drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, and a slight decline in overall attendance. These issues with spectator turnout were accompanied by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.Schmittou, Larry. "Message from the President." The Nashville Sounds 1985 Souvenir Program. 1985: 8. Schmittou and team owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to purchase the Evansville Triplets of the American Association, with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. In order to prove to the team's Nashville banks, which would back the purchase, that the move was financially viable, Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a Double-A team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision, the banks were not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation. Schmittou had planned to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets. However, when the City of Evansville balked at the request for stadium upgrades, the team was instead moved to Huntsville, Alabama, where it became the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded it. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the Stars were established as an entirely-new franchise.  The Sounds entered the Triple-A playing level as an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers in 1985.

The surplus cougar outfit was sent to Nashville, and, after building a fan following during Ozzie's first season, team management decided to make him the permanent mascot."Sounds GM hates aging ballpark but loves market." The Tennessean. August 5, 2007: 1-2E. In 1997, the Ozzie costume was identical to the brown cougar costume which is still in use by Kane County. In 1998, a new yellow costume was introduced. Ozzie wore the same style of uniform as the team, but with no hat. Ozzie was retired when the Sounds left Greer Stadium in 2014, although he continued to make appearances during the 2014 to 2015 off-season. In addition to promotions that are synonymous with minor league baseball like giveaways, theme nights, fireworks nights, and discounted ticket or concessions nights, the Nashville Sounds also host what are called Faith Nights. In 2002, the Sounds became the first sports team to host Faith Night promotions."About Third Coast Sports." Third Coast Sports. Retrieved on January 30, 2008. These Christian-based promotional evenings include pre-game concerts from Christian music artists, Bible-themed bobblehead giveaways, and testimonials from players about their faith. Artists performing at Nashville's Greer Stadium in the past include Jars of Clay, Hawk Nelson, and Matthew West. Brent High, then Vice President of Sales for the Sounds, and Mike Snider, the president and owner of Third Coast Sports, an entertainment and sports marketing firm in Nashville, are credited with developing the promotion. Since their inception, Faith Nights have been among the top-ten most-attended games each season.Cornish, Audie. "Baseball Teams Woo Christian Fans to Games." National Public Radio. May 26, 2006. Retrieved on October 23, 2007.

It has also been used by major league teams such as the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals. Teams from the National Football League and National Basketball Association have also shown interest in holding Faith Night promotions.

Nashville has honored two of its players by retiring their uniform numbers. When a number is retired, only the player with the retired number can wear that number if he returns to that team as a player or coach. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team. The team displays its retired numbers on the front of the press box at First Tennessee Park. Two members of the Sounds have been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Hoyt Wilhelm, who served as the team's pitching coach from 1982 to 1984, was elected in 1985.
