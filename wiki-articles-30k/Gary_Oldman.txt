    Gary Leonard OldmanBirths, Marriages & Deaths Index of England & Wales, 1916–2005. (born 21 March 1958)  is an English actor, filmmaker, musician and author. Renowned for his "big" acting style, Oldman is one of the most celebrated thespians of his generation, with a diverse career encompassing theatre, film and television. Oldman began acting on stage in 1979, and gained his first starring film role in Meantime (1983). He continued to lead an acclaimed theatre career, during which he performed at London's Royal Court and was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, with credits including The Massacre at Paris (1980), Entertaining Mr Sloane (1983), Saved (1983), Women Beware Women (1986), The Country Wife (1987) and Hamlet (1987). Oldman's portrayals of Sid Vicious and Joe Orton, in the biographical films Sid and Nancy (1986) and Prick Up Your Ears (1987) respectively, prompted critic Roger Ebert to declare him "the best young British actor around"; the latter brought Oldman his first BAFTA Award nomination. Roles as a football firm leader in The Firm (1989) and the titular Rosencrantz in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990) further increased his renown within British film. Oldman went on to achieve international recognition as an Irish American gangster in State of Grace (1990), Lee Harvey Oswald in JFK (1991), and Count Dracula in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), which earned him the Saturn Award for Best Actor. Emerging as a popular portrayer of villains, Oldman starred as corrupt DEA agent Norman Stansfield in Léon: The Professional (1994), as well as the antagonists of films such as True Romance (1993), The Fifth Element (1997), Air Force One (1997), and The Contender (2000), for which he garnered a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination; Oldman meanwhile played Ludwig van Beethoven in Immortal Beloved (1994). In the 21st century, he is known for his roles as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter series; James Gordon in The Dark Knight Trilogy; George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), which brought Academy and BAFTA Award nominations for Best Actor; and a human leader in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). Oldman also voiced the villain Lord Shen in Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011). As of 2016, motion pictures in which Oldman has starred have grossed over $10.6 billion. Outside of acting in film, he wrote and directed the double BAFTA Award-winning, Palme d'Or-nominated Nil by Mouth (1997); made an Emmy Award-nominated guest appearance in the Friends two-part episode "The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding" (2001); featured in music videos by artists including David Bowie, Guns N' Roses and Annie Lennox; and provided the voice of Viktor Reznov in the Call of Duty video game series. Oldman was born in New Cross, London, the son of Kathleen (née Cheriton; born 28 November 1919), a housewife, and Leonard Bertram Oldman (21 May 1921&nbsp;– October 1985), a former sailor who also worked as a welder.Gary Oldman – Biography.

Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving school at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop. He was a pianist as a child, and later a singer, but gave up his musical aspirations to pursue an acting career after seeing Malcolm McDowell's performance in the 1971 film The Raging Moon. In a 1995 interview with Charlie Rose, Oldman said: "Something about Malcolm just arrested me, and I connected, and I said, 'I wanna do that'." Growing up in south London, Oldman supported his local football club Millwall, and also followed Manchester United so that he could watch his idol, George Best."Gary Oldman: The spy who came in, and brought the cold with him".

He later won a scholarship to attend the Rose Bruford College in Sidcup, Southeast London, from which he graduated with a BA in Acting in 1979. Oldman describes himself as 'shy' although a diligent worker during his time at Rose Bruford, where he performed roles such as Puck in the performance of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. After leaving school, Oldman was the first in his class to receive professional work.Interview with Gary Oldman for the Screen Actors Guild Foundation, moderated by Jenelle Riley, 3 December 2011. Before enrolling at Rose Bruford, Oldman had unsuccessfully applied to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), which welcomed him to try again the following year, but advised him to find something else to do for a living. When asked by Charlie Rose if he had reminded RADA of this, Oldman joked that "the work speaks for itself". He made his professional stage debut in 1979 as Puss, alongside Michael Simkins and Peter Howitt, in Dick Whittington and His Cat, at York's Theatre Royal. The play then ran in Colchester, then with Glasgow's Citizens Theatre; Oldman's work ethic and trademark intensity would make him a favourite with audiences in Glasgow during the 1980s. From 1980 to 1981, he appeared in The Massacre at Paris (Christopher Marlowe), Desperado Corner (Shaun Lawton), and Robert David MacDonald's plays Chinchilla and A Waste of Time. He performed in a 6-month West End run of MacDonald's Summit Conference, opposite Glenda Jackson, in 1982. Also that year, Oldman made his film debut in Colin Gregg's Remembrance, and would have starred in Don Boyd's Gossip if that film had not collapsed. The following year, he landed a starring role as a skinhead in Mike Leigh's film Meantime, and moved on to Chesterfield to assume the lead role in Entertaining Mr Sloane (Joe Orton). Afterwards, he went to Westcliffe to star in Saved (Edward Bond). Saved proved to be a major breakthrough for Oldman. Max Stafford-Clark, artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre, had seen Oldman's performance and cast him as Scopey, the lead role of Bond's The Pope's Wedding, in 1984. For his acclaimed performance, he won two of British theatre's top honours: the Time Out Fringe Award for Best Newcomer, and the Drama Theatre Award for Best Actor—the latter of which was shared with future film co-star Anthony Hopkins for his performance in Pravda. Oldman's turn in The Pope's Wedding led to a run of work with the Royal Court, and from 1984 to 1986 he appeared in Rat in the Skull (Ron Hutchinson), The Desert Air (Nicholas Wright), Cain and Abel, The Danton Affair (Pam Gems), Women Beware Women (Thomas Middleton), Real Dreams (Trevor Griffiths) and all three of Bond's The War Plays: Red Black and Ignorant, The Tin Can People and Great Peace. Oldman was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1985 to 1986. The 1984 production of The Pope's Wedding had been seen by director Alex Cox, who offered Oldman the part of ill-fated rocker Sid Vicious in the 1986 film Sid and Nancy. He twice turned down the role before accepting it, because, in his own words: "I wasn't really that interested in Sid Vicious and the punk movement. I'd never followed it. It wasn't something that interested me. The script I felt was banal and 'who cares' and 'why bother' and all of that. And I was a little bit sort-of with my nose in the air and sort-of thinking 'well the theatre – so much more superior' and all of that." He reconsidered based on the salary and the urging of his agent. In 1987, Oldman gained his third starring film role as Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears, for which he received a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor. That same year, he appeared in the plays The Country Wife (William Wycherley) and Serious Money (Caryl Churchill). Director Luc Besson told how, on the set of The Fifth Element (1997), Oldman could recite any scene from Hamlet (William Shakespeare), in which he had starred a decade earlier. Oldman's performances in Sid and Nancy and Prick Up Your Ears paved the way for work in Hollywood, garnering acclaim from prominent United States film critic Roger Ebert. Ebert wrote: "There is no point of similarity between the two performances; like a few gifted actors, [Oldman] is able to re-invent himself for every role. On the basis of these two movies, he is the best young British actor around." Vicious's band mate John Lydon, despite criticising Sid and Nancy, described Oldman as a "bloody good actor". Oldman lost considerable weight for the role and was hospitalised.Zap, Claudine. Actors' dramatic weight loss for roles. Yahoo! Movies. Retrieved 11 December 2012.

In 1994's Léon: The Professional, he played corrupt DEA officer Norman Stansfield, which has since been named by multiple publications as one of the best villains of modern cinema.See Creation and legacy of Norman Stansfield.

He received an Emmy Award nomination for two guest appearances in Friends in May 2001, appearing in the two-part episode "The One With Chandler and Monica's Wedding" as Richard Crosby, a pedantic actor who insists that "real" actors spit on one another when they enunciate, leading to tension, then later friendship, between Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) and himself.

A deputy city attorney stated that Oldman's blood alcohol content was found to be more than twice California's limit for legal intoxication. Some media outlets reported that Oldman was unhappy with the finished product of The Contender (2000) because DreamWorks had edited the film to reflect pro-Democratic leanings, stirring controversy. The claims were declared sloppy sensationalism by Oldman's manager, Urbanski, who summarized that Oldman was "the least political person he knew", that "neither he nor Oldman had made the statements attributed to them," that they had "produced the film every last cut and frame," and that "DreamWorks did not influence the final cut or have anything to do with it." It has been suggested that Oldman was blacklisted in Hollywood for several years as a result.Mendelson, Scott (7 November 2008). Oh My God, They Killed Gary (Oldman)! Huffington Post. Retrieved 6 August 2012. Oldman's former wife Donya Fiorentino, as part of a child custody battle in 2001, claimed he had a drug habit and abused her. Oldman vehemently denied both the abuse and drug allegations, and described her as a "hopeless addict and liar" who, he claimed, had also been cheating on him. He subsequently claimed to partly be £2.7million in debt because his ex-wife had been constantly harassing him for money and subjecting him to 'psychological and emotional' abuse during their three-year marriage. She had also previously overdosed on cocaine, to which she was addicted, traumatising her young daughter who found her on the floor and presumed she was dead. In an interview in the July/August 2014 issue of Playboy magazine while promoting Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Oldman criticized what he saw as excessive political correctness in American media and the entertainment industry's own discriminating hypocrisy, while arguing in support of former controversial celebrities Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin. He stressed that he did not relate with most of their viewpoints but regarding the former agreed, "Mel Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews" (referring to Hollywood). After vehement criticism from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Oldman responded to them in an open letter: “I see how insensitive they may be, and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype. Anything that contributes to this stereotype is unacceptable, including my own words on the matter. If, during the interview, I had been asked to elaborate on this point I would have pointed out that I had just finished reading Neal Gabler’s superb book about the Jews and Hollywood, An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews invented Hollywood. The fact is that our business, and my own career specifically, owes an enormous debt to that contribution.” ADL director Abraham Foxman responded by claiming it only reinforced Oldman's antisemitism, and that Oldman saw the world too stereotypically. Foxman said: "I think [Oldman] feels bad about what he said, but the way he explains it underlines why he said what he said. I'd like to see a little more introspection, a little more understanding and a little more education rather than a statement that looks like a PR move." Oldman made a public apology on the 25 June edition of late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he stressed that he was "profoundly sorry" for his "insensitive, pernicious and ill-informed" remarks. Oldman has been a vocal critic of the Golden Globes over the years. In 2009, he spoke of an earlier row with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association at a press conference, in which he lambasted the awards for being a television ratings vehicle, rather than a celebration of art; Oldman believes he is disqualified from Globes contention due to his comments. In a 2012 interview, he described the ceremony as "bent", while unfavourably comparing the integrity of its voting process to that of the Academy and BAFTA awards. Two years later, Oldman called the Globes "meaningless", called for a boycott, and labelled members of the HFPA as self-indulgent "nobodies", while reinforcing his position on the Academy Awards being more credible.
