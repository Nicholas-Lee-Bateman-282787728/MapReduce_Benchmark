     West Bromwich Albion Football Club , also known as West Brom, The Baggies, The Throstles, Albion or simply WBA, is an English professional football club based in West Bromwich in the West Midlands. The club was formed in 1878 and has played at its home ground, The Hawthorns, since 1900. Albion were one of the founding members of the Football League in 1888 and have spent the majority of their existence in the top tier of English football. They have been champions of England once, in 1919–20 and have been runners-up twice but they have had more success in the FA Cup, winning it five times. The first came in 1888, the year the league was founded, and the most recent in 1968, their last major trophy. They also won the Football League Cup at the first attempt in 1966. The club's longest consecutive period in the top division was between 1949 and 1973, and from 1986 to 2002 they spent their longest ever spell out of the top division. The 2015–16 season is now their tenth non consecutive season in the top flight since 2002. The team has played in blue and white stripes for most of the club's history. Albion have a number of long-standing rivalries with other West Midlands clubs; their traditional rivals have always been Aston Villa, though rivalry also exists with Wolverhampton Wanderers, with whom they contest the Black Country derby.   The club was founded as West Bromwich Strollers in 1878 by workers from George Salter's Spring Works in West Bromwich, in Staffordshire.McOwan pp. 7–10. They were renamed West Bromwich Albion in 1880, becoming the first team to adopt the Albion suffix. Albion was a district of West Bromwich where some of the players lived or worked, close to what is today Greets Green. The club joined the Birmingham & District Football Association in 1881 and became eligible for their first competition, the Birmingham Cup. They reached the quarter-finals, beating several longer-established clubs on the way. In 1883, Albion won their first trophy, the Staffordshire Cup. Albion joined the Football Association in the same year; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup for the first time in the 1883–84 season.McOwan pp. 13–14. In 1885 the club turned professional, and in 1886 they reached the FA Cup final for the first time, losing 2–0 to Blackburn Rovers in a replay. They reached the final again in 1887, but lost 2–0 to Aston Villa. In 1888 the team won the trophy for the first time, beating strong favourites Preston North End 2–1 in the final.McOwan p. 20.  In March 1888, William McGregor wrote to what he considered to be the top five English teams, including Albion, informing them of his intention to form an association of clubs that would play each other home and away each season. Thus when the Football League started later that year, Albion became one of the twelve founder members.McOwan pp. 19–21. Albion's second FA Cup success came in 1892, beating Aston Villa 3–0. They met Villa again in the 1895 final, but lost 1–0. The team suffered relegation to Division Two in 1900–01, their first season at the Hawthorns.McOwan p. 30. They were promoted as champions the following season but relegated again in 1903–04.McOwan p. 32. The club won the Division Two championship once more in 1910–11, and the following season reached another FA Cup Final, where they were defeated by Second Division Barnsley in a replay.McOwan pp. 36–37. Albion won the Football League title in 1919–20 for the only time in their history following the end of the First World War, their totals of 104 goals and 60 points both breaking the previous league records.McOwan p. 42. The team finished as Division One runners-up in 1924–25, narrowly losing out to Huddersfield Town, but were relegated in 1926–27.McOwan p. 45. In 1930–31 they won promotion as well as the FA Cup, beating Birmingham 2–1 in the final.McOwan pp. 50–51. The "Double" of winning the FA Cup and promotion has not been achieved before or since.As of 2008. Matthews (2007) p. 23. Albion reached the final again in 1935, losing to Sheffield Wednesday, but were relegated three years later.McOwan pp. 53–55. They gained promotion in 1948–49,McOwan p. 58. and there followed the club's longest unbroken spell in the top flight of English football, a total of 24 years. In 1953–54 Albion came close to being the first team in the 20th century to win the League and Cup double. They succeeded in winning the FA Cup, beating Preston North End 3–2, but injuries and a loss of form towards the end of the season meant that they finished as runners-up to fierce rivals Wolves in the league.McOwan pp. 67–68. Nonetheless, Albion became known for their brand of fluent, attacking football, with the 1953–54 side being hailed as the "Team of the Century". One national newspaper went so far as to suggest that the team be chosen en masse to represent England at the 1954 World Cup finals. They remained one of the top English sides for the remainder of the decade, reaching the semi-final of the 1957 FA Cup and achieving three consecutive top five finishes in Division One between 1957–58 and 1959–60.  Although their league form was less impressive during the 1960s, the second half of the decade saw West Bromwich Albion establish a reputation as a successful cup side. In 1966, under manager Jimmy Hagan, they beat West Ham in their first League Cup appearance, winning 5–3 on aggregate in the last two-legged final. The following year they reached the final again, the first at Wembley, but lost 3–2 to Third Division Queens Park Rangers after being 2–0 up at half-time.McOwan pp. 87–88. Albion's cup form continued under Hagan's successor Alan Ashman. He guided the club to their last major trophy to date, the 1968 FA Cup, when they beat Everton in extra time thanks to a single goal from Jeff Astle.McOwan pp. 94–96. Albion reached the FA Cup semi-final and European Cup Winners Cup quarter-final in 1969, and were defeated 2–1 by Manchester City in the 1970 League Cup Final.McOwan pp. 97–99. The club were less successful during the reign of Don Howe, and were relegated to Division Two at the end of 1972–1973,McOwan p. 105. but gained promotion three years later under the guidance of player-manager Johnny Giles.McOwan pp. 113–114. Under Ron Atkinson, Albion reached the 1978 FA Cup semi-final but lost to Ipswich Town.McOwan p. 120. They were then the first Western football team to tour China, playing several exhibition games over 3 weeks. In 1978–79, the team finished third in Division One, their highest placing for over 20 years, and also reached the UEFA Cup quarter-final, where they were defeated by Red Star Belgrade.McOwan pp. 124–127. In his second spell as manager, Ronnie Allen guided the team to both domestic cup semi-finals in 1981–82.McOwan pp. 136–138. The mid-1980s saw the start of Albion's longest and deepest decline. They were relegated in 1985–86 with the worst record in the club's history,McOwan p. 144. beginning a period of sixteen years outside the top flight. Five years later the club were relegated to the Third Division for the first and only time.McOwan p. 154. Albion had spent the majority of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992–93 Albion finished fourth and entered the playoffs for the first time, having just missed out the previous year. Albion's first appearance at Wembley for over twenty years—and their last ever at the original stadium—saw them beat Port Vale 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First Division.McOwan pp. 158–159. Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge. The appointment of Gary Megson in March 2000 heralded an upturn in the club's fortunes. Megson guided Albion to Division One safety in 1999–2000, and to the play-offs a year later. He went on to lead the club to promotion to the Premier League in 2001–02. After being relegated in their first Premier League season, they made an immediate return to the top flight in 2003–04. In 2004–05 Megson's successor, former Albion midfielder Bryan Robson, led the team to a last-day "Great Escape", when Albion became the first Premier League club to avoid relegation having been bottom of the table at Christmas. This feat was repeated by Sunderland in the 2013–14 season, but West Brom remain the only team to also have been bottom during the final day of the season. Despite this success, they failed to avoid the drop the following season, and Robson was replaced by Tony Mowbray in October 2006. The club competed in the Championship promotion playoff final at Wembley Stadium on 28 May 2007, but lost 1–0 to Derby County. The following season, in 2007–08, Mowbray led the Baggies to Wembley again, this time in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they lost 1–0 to Portsmouth. One month later, Albion were promoted to the Premier League as winners of the Championship, but were relegated at the end of the 2008–09 campaign. In June 2009, Mowbray left the club to manage Celtic and was replaced by Roberto Di Matteo in the role of head coach. Di Matteo led the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt, but was dismissed in February 2011 and replaced by Roy Hodgson. May 2012 saw Roy Hodgson, having led West Brom to a 10th-place finish in his first season, leave to accept an offer to become the manager of the England national football team. Steve Clarke then led Albion to an 8th-place finish in 2012–13, their highest in the Premier League, but was sacked during the following season after four consecutive league defeats and only winning 7 league games throughout the calendar year. Clarke was replaced as head coach by Pepe Mel, who left by mutual consent a few months later at the end of the 2013/14 season. He was replaced by Alan Irvine. Irvine then got his first win with West Brom against Tottenham Hotspur F.C. on 21 September 2014 in a 1–0 victory. Alan Irvine was sacked on 29 December 2014 following 7 defeats in 9 games and only 4 wins in 19 games. On 1 January 2015, Pulis was appointed head coach. He won his first game in charge 7–0 against Conference Premier side Gateshead in an FA Cup third round match.   West Bromwich Albion have played in navy blue and white striped shirts for the majority of their existence, usually with white shorts and white socks. The team is occasionally referred to as the Stripes by supporters. A number of different colours were trialled during the club's formative years however, including cardinal red and blue quarters in 1880–81, yellow and white quarters in 1881–82, chocolate and blue halves in 1881–82 and 1882–83, red and white hoops in 1882–83, chocolate and white in 1883–84 and cardinal red and blue halves in 1884–85.McOwan p. 13. The blue and white stripes made their first appearance in the 1885–86 season, although at that time they were of a lighter shade of blue; the navy blue stripes did not appear until after the First World War. For the regional leagues played during the Second World War, Albion were forced to switch to all-blue shirts, as rationing meant that striped material was considered a luxury.McOwan p. 56. Like all football clubs, Albion sport a secondary or "change" strip when playing away from home against a team whose colours clash with their own. As long ago as the 1890s, and throughout much of the club's early history, a change strip of white jerseys with black shorts was worn.Matthews (1987) p. 241. The away shirt additionally featured a large 'V' during the First World War.Matthews (1987) p. 188. In the 1935 FA Cup Final however, when both of Albion and Sheffield Wednesday's kits clashed, a switch was made to plain navy blue shirts. An all-red strip was adopted at the end of the 1950s, but was dropped following defeat in the 1967 League Cup Final, to be replaced by the all-white design that was worn during the club's FA Cup run of 1967–68. Since then the away strip has changed regularly, with yellow and green stripes the most common of a number of different designs used. In the 1990s and 2000s a third kit has occasionally been introduced. Albion players—along with those of other Football League teams—first wore numbers on the back of their shirts in the abandoned season of 1939–40, and names on the back of their shirts from 1999–2000.  Red numbers were added to the side of Albion players' shorts in 1969. BSR Housewares became the club's first shirt sponsor during the 1981–82 season. The club's shirts have been sponsored for the majority of the time since then, although there was no shirt sponsor at the end of the 1993–94 season, after local solicitors Coucher & Shaw were closed down by the Law Society.  Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were again without a shirt sponsor for the start of the 2008–09 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began. The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society. Since May 2011, West Brom's kit has been manufactured by Adidas, who are contracted until 2016.   Albion's main club badge dates back to the late 1880s, when the club's secretary Tom Smith suggested that a throstle (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge.McOwan p. 15. Since then, the club badge has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club's move to the Hawthorns. The throstle was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, the Throstles. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979 an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns,Matthews (1987) p. 239. and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s. In 1975 a version of the badge (on a roundel rather than a shield) was granted by the College of Arms to the Football League, for licensing to the club. The badge was described in heraldic blazon as On a roundel paly of thirteen argent and azure a missel thrush perched on a raspberry branch leaved and fructed proper. This is the only known occasion on which the branch has been described as a raspberry branch rather than a hawthorn branch: Rodney Dennys, the officer of arms responsible, may have been imperfectly briefed. The badge has been subject to various revisions through the years, meaning that the club was unable to register it as a trademark. As a result of this, the badge was re-designed in 2006, incorporating the name of the club for the first time. The new badge gave Albion the legal protection they sought. The main club badge should be distinguished from the badge displayed on the first team strip, as the two have rarely coincided. No badge appeared on the kit for most of the club's history, although the Stafford knot featured on the team jerseys for part of the 1880s.Matthews (2007) p. 64. The West Bromwich town arms were worn on the players' shirts for the 1931, 1935 and 1954 FA Cup finals. The town's Latin motto, Labor omnia vincit, translates as "labour conquers all things" or "work conquers all". The town arms were revived as the shirt badge from 1994 until 2000, with the throstle moved to the collar of the shirts. Albion's first regular shirt badge appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s where it was blue. Although it featured the throstle, it did not include the blue and white striped shield of the club badge. A similar design was also used during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1970s, a more abstract version of the throstle was used on the club's shirts, while in the late 1970s through to the mid-1980s, an embroidered WBA logo was displayed, a common abbreviation of the club's name in print. Not until the early 21st century did the full club badge appear on the team's shirts.   The speed with which the club became established following its foundation is illustrated by the fact that it outgrew four successive grounds in its first seven years. The first was Cooper's Hill, where they played from 1878 to 1879. From 1879 to 1881 they appear to have alternated between Cooper's Hill and Dartmouth Park.Full Throstle DVD 0:05:36 During the 1881–82 season they played at Bunn's Field, also known as the Birches. This had a capacity of between 1,500 and 2,000,Full Throstle DVD 0:06:37 and was Albion's first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time. From 1882 to 1885, as the popularity of football increased, Albion rented the Four Acres ground from the well-established West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club. But they quickly outgrew this new home and soon needed to move again. From 1885 to 1900 Albion played at Stoney Lane; their tenure of this ground was arguably the most successful period in the club's history, as they won the FA Cup twice and were runners-up three times. By 1900, when the lease on Stoney Lane expired, the club needed a bigger ground yet again and so made its last move to date. All of Albion's previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up a site on the town's border with Handsworth and Smethwick. The new ground was named the Hawthorns, after the hawthorn bushes that covered the area and were cleared to make way for it.Full Throstle DVD 0:15:16 Albion drew 1–1 with Derby County in the first match at the stadium, on 3 September 1900.Matthews (2007) p. 79. The record attendance at the Hawthorns was on 6 March 1937, when 64,815 spectators saw Albion beat Arsenal 3–1 in the FA Cup quarter-final.Matthews (2007) pp. 83–84. The Hawthorns became an all-seater stadium in the 1990s, in order to comply with the recommendations of the Taylor Report. Its capacity today is 26,850, the four stands being known respectively as the Birmingham Road End, Smethwick End, East Stand and West Stand.  At an altitude of 551&nbsp;feet (168&nbsp;m) above sea level, the Hawthorns is the highest of all the 92 Premier League and Football League grounds.Matthews (2007) p. 72. The Hawthorns is certificated under the highest UEFA pitch surfaces which means it is ready to host almost any competition if required however attendance may scupper this. Its West Stand could be developed over the Halford's Lane road at the back of the stand to allow an upper tier, approximately adding around 5,000 to the capacity of The Hawthorns. Other developments can include the filling in of The Millenium and East-Rainbow corners if and when required. West Bromwich Albion as a football club own many retail outlets around The Hawthorns stadium including its Megastore, its club store in Merry Hill and seasonally a club store for the first time in 2014, in West Bromwich Town Centre. They also own the former Hawthorns Pub a Grade II listed building behind the West Stand on the corner of Halford's Lane and the Birmingham Road. This is opening against the home fixture vs Southampton in September 2015. It will be the official club fanzone with licensed bars, live music, fan favourites such as mascots and children activities as well as being shared with a high street food outlet. This is to compete with the famous The Vine pub in Roebuck Lane which a popular destination for all visiting and home football fans year-in-year-out.  The West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club has branches throughout the United Kingdom, as well as in Ireland, Australia, Malta, Greece (unofficial), Jersey, Northern Ireland, United States (unofficial), India and Thailand. Albion's "club anthem" is The Lord's my Shepherd, a setting of Psalm 23.  Supporters of the team celebrate goals by bouncing up and down and chanting "Boing Boing". This dates back to the 1992–93 season, when the team was promoted from the new Second Division. In recent years fans of the team have celebrated the end of each season by adopting a fancy dress theme for the final away match, including dressing as vikings in 2004 in honour of Player of the Season Thomas Gaardsøe. In 2002–03 Albion's fans were voted the best in the Premier League by their peers, while in the BBC's 2002 "national intelligence test" Test the Nation, they were found to be "more likely to be smarter than any other football supporters, registering an average score of 138". Famous Fans include comedian Frank Skinner, former ITV presenter Adrian Chiles, One Direction singer Liam Payne, comedian Lenny Henry, tennis player Goran Ivanisevic, Cat Deeley,and guitarist Eric Clapton. The club has published an official matchday programme for supporters since 1905. The publication was entitled Albion News for many years, but was renamed Albion from the 2002–03 season until the close season of 2013, when it was renamed back to Albion News. It won Premier League Programme of the Year in 2002–03 and Third Division Programme of the Year in 1991–92. In 2007–08 it was awarded Championship Programme of the Year by both Programme Monthly and the Football Programme Directory. The programme has a circulation in excess of 8,000 copies.  The first West Bromwich Albion fanzine, Fingerpost, was published from 1983 until 1992, and was followed by several others, most notably Grorty Dick (1989–2005) and Last Train to Rolfe Street (1992–1995). Since Grorty Dick ceased publication in 2005, the club now only has one fanzine dedicated to it; 'Baggie Shorts' which is produced by the West Bromwich Albion Supporters' Club London Branch.  Although known in their early days as "the Throstles", the club's more popular nickname among supporters came to be the Baggies, a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced. The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the 1900s, but its exact origins are uncertain.McOwan pp. 38–40. One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at Aston Villa, because of the large baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the Black Country.Full Throstle DVD 0:08:48 Club historian Tony Matthews however suggests that it derives from the "bagmen", who carried the club's matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line. Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the club's early years. The official club mascots are named Baggie Bird and Albi; both are based on the throstle depicted on the club crest. Historically, Albion's greatest rivals have always been Aston Villa from nearby Birmingham. The two clubs contested three FA Cup Finals between 1887 and 1895 (Villa winning two and Albion one). More recently however, most Albion fans have begun to see Wolverhampton Wanderers as their main rivals – particularly between 1989 and 2002 when Albion and Villa were never in the same division but Albion were in the same division as Wolves for 11 out of 14 seasons. However, with Albion and Villa being in different divisions for so many years, the rivalry is less heated as Aston Villa supporters consider Birmingham City as their main local rivals and not Albion despite geographical distance between the two clubs. Albion and Wolves have contested the Black Country derby, it is one of the longest standing derbys in world football, being played more than 150 times; their first major clash was an FA Cup tie in 1886. The rivalry came to prominence when the two clubs contested the league title in 1953–54, and during the 1990s it intensified to new heights among supporters, with both clubs languishing in Division One for much of the decade and only local pride at stake.McOwan p. 162. Moreover, in 2002 Albion came from being 11 points adrift to overhaul Wolves to gain promotion. The rivalry was further heightened after the sides met in the play-offs in 2007. A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com confirmed that the majority of both Albion and Wolves supporters consider the other to be their main rival. A less-heated rivalry also exists with Birmingham City, with whom Albion contested the 1931 FA Cup final, as well as a semi-final in 1968. Despite their geographical location Walsall are seen as lesser rivals, having played in a lower division than Albion for most of their history. A number of hooligan firms associate themselves with Albion, including Section 5, Clubhouse and the Smethwick Mob. Ranked by The Daily Telegraph as the most fierce in the region behind the Black Country derby and the Second City derby games between Aston Villa and West Brom are quite fierce. The two first met on 9 December 1882, in the second round of the Staffordshire Cup: Villa hosted a 3–3 draw in front of 13,900 fans, while in the replay West Bromwich Albion won by a single goal with an attendance of 10,500. On 3 January 1885 they met for the first time in the third round of the FA Cup: a goalless draw at West Bromwich Albion was followed by a 3–0 victory for them away at Aston Villa. The following year, both teams became founder members of The Football League. They met first in a league fixture on 19 January 1889, Villa winning 2–0 at home, and again the next week in a 3–3 draw. The two teams met in two further FA Cup finals in the 19th century, a 3–0 win for West Bromwich Albion in 1892 and a 1–0 win for Aston Villa in 1895. Birmingham City were relegated from the Premier League in 2011 and Wolverhampton Wanderers a season later, leaving Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion as the only West Midlands teams in England's top division and without their respective main rivals and with Albion finishing above their nearest rivals for the second season in a row, the historic rivalry is re-surfacing. In the 2000s BBC television drama series New Tricks the characters Jack Halford, Brian Lane and Gerry Standing were so named by the writer Roy Mitchell in honour of the Halford Lane standing area of Albion's ground.Radio Times magazine, 18–24 September 2010, page 112 The 1960s television documentary programme Look at Britain screened an episode called "The Saturday Men" focusing on the club[ ] Look at Britain: The Saturday men Frank Skinner and Paula Wilcox starred in the comedy series Blue Heaven which followed the adventures of an Albion supporter in the 1990s and included scenes from the Hawthorns. Skinner is a real life Albion supporter.4od (channel four)   In the club's formative years, West Bromwich Albion were run by a seven-man playing committee, and funded by each member contributing a weekly subscription of 6d (six pence) (2½p).Matthews (2007) p. 10. Albion's first chairman was Henry Jackson, appointed in 1885, with the club becoming a limited company in June 1891.Matthews (2005) pp. 267–269. Other early chairmen of Albion included Jem Bayliss and Billy Bassett, both of whom had earlier played for the club. Indeed, from 1878 to 1986 there was always an Albion player or ex-player on the club's committee or board of directors. Bassett became an Albion director in 1905, following the resignation of the previous board in its entirety. The club was in deep financial trouble and had had a writ served upon them by their bank, but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club, aided by local fund-raising activities.McOwan pp. 33–34. Bassett became chairman in 1908, and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players' summer wages from his own pocket.McOwan pp. 34–35. He remains Albion's longest-serving chairman, having held the position until his death in 1937.Matthews (2005) pp. 25–26 & p. 267. The club's longest-serving director was Major H. Wilson Keys, during the period 1930–1965, including 15 years as chairman. He became FA vice-president in 1969.Matthews (2005) pp. 267–268. Sir Bert Millichip served as Albion chairman from 1974 to 1983, after which he chose to concentrate on his role as chairman of the Football Association.Matthews (1987) p. 309. In 1996 the club became a Public limited company, issuing shares to supporters at £500 and £3000 each. The shares were quoted on the Alternative Investment Market, but the club withdrew from the stock exchange in order to become a private company again in 2004. The name of the company thus reverted from West Bromwich Albion plc to West Bromwich Albion Limited, the latter becoming a subsidiary of West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited. Current chairman Jeremy Peace took up the post in 2002, after a rift between previous chairman Paul Thompson and manager Gary Megson forced Thompson to quit the club. In September 2007, Peace acquired additional shares in West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited, taking his total stake in the company to 50.56%. This triggered a requirement, under the Takeover Code, for him to make a mandatory cash offer for the remaining shares in both WBA Holdings Ltd and WBA Ltd. Later that year, Michelle Davies became Albion's first female director. She, however, has since stepped down from this position.http://www.wba.co.uk/page/News/0,,10366~1925971,00.html Jeremy Peace announced in June 2008 that he was looking for a major new investor for the club, but no firm proposals were received by 31 July deadline.  On 24 July 2015, Jeremy Peace announced that his sale exclusivity deal was now off after potential buyer was unable to fulfil terms of sale.                                                         As part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations in 2004, a survey was commissioned via the official West Bromwich Albion website and the Express & Star newspaper to determine the greatest West Bromwich Albion players of all time. A modern-day 16-man squad was compiled from the results; all selected players are depicted on a commemorative mural displayed at the Hawthorns. Fourteen of the sixteen players are English-born, with a fifteenth, Cyrille Regis, being a full England international. The list of sixteen is as follows:  Other notable honours bestowed upon West Bromwich Albion players include the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which was presented to Cyrille Regis in 1979. In 1998, Billy Bassett and Bryan Robson were named among the list of Football League 100 Legends, along with Arthur Rowley, Geoff Hurst and Johnny Giles. Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, to be joined two years later by Geoff Hurst. Bobby Robson, a player with Albion, has also been inducted, although this was for his achievements as a manager. In 1919–20, Fred Morris became the first Albion player to finish as top goalscorer in Division One, a feat which has since been repeated by Ronnie Allen, Derek Kevan, Jeff Astle and Tony Brown. Brown, who holds the club records for goals and appearances, was voted into the PFA Centenary Hall of Fame in July 2007.  The following managers have all led West Bromwich Albion to at least one of the following achievements whilst in charge of the club: winning a major trophy or reaching the final, achieving a top three league finish in the top flight, winning promotion or reaching the quarter-finals of a major European competition.   West Bromwich Albion's record victory was their 12–0 league win against Darwen on 4 April 1892. This is still the widest margin of victory for a game in the top-flight of English football, although the record was equalled by Nottingham Forest when they beat Leicester Fosse by the same scoreline in 1909. Albion's biggest FA Cup victory came when they beat Chatham 10–1 on 2 March 1889. The club's record league defeat was a 3–10 loss against Stoke City on 4 February 1937, while a 0–5 defeat to Leeds United on 18 February 1967 represents Albion's heaviest FA Cup loss. Tony Brown holds a number of Albion's club records. He has made the most appearances overall for the club (720), as well as most appearances in the league (574), FA Cup (54) and in European competition (17). Brown is the club's top scorer in the league (218), the FA Cup (27) and in Europe (8). He is also the club's record scorer overall, with 279 goals. W. G. Richardson scored 328 goals for the club, but this includes 100 during the Second World War, which are not normally counted towards competitive totals. Richardson holds the club record for most league goals in a single season, scoring 39 times in 1935–36.McOwan p. 319. Albion's most capped international player, taking into account only those caps won whilst at the club, is Chris Brunt. He has appeared 38 times for Northern Ireland as a West Bromwich Albion player, earning 48 caps in total. Jesse Pennington is the club's most capped England international, with 25 caps.Matthews (2007) pp. 404–405. The highest transfer fee paid by the club is £12 million to Zenit for José Salomón Rondón on 10 August 2015. The deal could rise to over £15 million with appearance fee and other add ons. The record transfer from Albion to another club is that of Curtis Davies to Aston Villa in July 2008, for a fee of £8.5&nbsp;million. A.&nbsp;: Older sources quote the year of formation as 1879, as evidence of a Strollers match from 1878 came to light only as recently as 1993. B.&nbsp;: Throstle is a colloquial Black Country name for the song thrush. C.&nbsp;: The town crest remained on the away strip until 2001. D.&nbsp;: Kevan was joint-top scorer with Ray Crawford of Ipswich Town. E.&nbsp;: Secretary-manager. Albion did not appoint a full-time manager until 1949. F.&nbsp;: The Football League First Division was the top division of English football until 1992, when the Premier League became the top division. At the same time, the second, third and fourth tiers of English football became known as the Football League First Division, Second Division and Third Division respectively. These three divisions were renamed again in 2004 as part of a Football League re-branding exercise, becoming known as the Football League Championship, League One and League Two respectively.
