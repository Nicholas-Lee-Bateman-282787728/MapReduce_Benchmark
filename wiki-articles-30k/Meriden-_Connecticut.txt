In 1888, the Meriden Gravure Company (in Meriden 1888-1989) was founded by Charles Parker and James F. Allen, and continued a previous printing operation by Parker. The company developed an expertise in high quality image reproduction, which initially was driven by the needs of the silver industry. The company quickly attracted business from clients that required highly detailed image reproduction, including scientific journals, museums, libraries, and illustrated book publishers. The company developed an extensive list of academic, museum, and commercial customers, including General Electric and the United States government. According to the Yale University Library, "Through careful quality control, including an insistence on photographing directly from the item to be reproduced and using high quality paper, Meriden Gravure achieved a reputation of consistent excellence in printed illustration... [and] rose to prominence in the early twentieth century through specialization in high-fidelity image reproduction."
