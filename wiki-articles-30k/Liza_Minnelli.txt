   Liza May Minnelli (, born March 12, 1946) is an American actress and singer best known for her portrayal of Sally Bowles in the 1972 musical film Cabaret which won her an Academy Award for Best Actress. The daughter of film actress and singer Judy Garland (1922–1969) and film director Vincente Minnelli (1903–1986), Liza Minnelli started her career while in her teens as a musical theatre actress and nightclub performer in New York City. In 1965, she made her Broadway debut in the musical Flora the Red Menace and was awarded the Tony Award for best actress in a musical (at 19, the youngest actress in Broadway history to win the honor). Critically lauded for her dramatic performance in the film The Sterile Cuckoo (1969), she rose to international stardom with Cabaret and the Emmy Award-winning TV special Liza with a Z (1972). Many of her following film projects got mixed reviews and failed commercially, until the 1981 comedy Arthur. She successfully returned to Broadway stage starring in the musical The Act in 1977. Known today as a pop standard singer, she recorded contemporary singer-songwriter material through the late 1960s and 1970s. Struggling with drug use, Minnelli became one of the first prominent people openly talking about rehab. From the late 1970s on, her work has focused on concert tours and nightclub performances. She gave highly regarded performances at Carnegie Hall in 1979 and 1987, and at Radio City Music Hall in 1991 and 1992. Switching between old school entertainment and contemporary music in the late 1980s, she both toured Frank, Liza & Sammy: The Ultimate Event alongside Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. and recorded the pop album Results produced by the British duo Pet Shop Boys. Many of her albums are live records. Struggling with viral encephalitis, Minnelli returned with her concert show Liza's Back in 2002 and made critically acclaimed guest appearances in the sitcom Arrested Development from 2003 to 2013, while continuing to tour internationally and performing Liza's at The Palace...! on Broadway in 2008/2009.

Minnelli was the voice of Dorothy (a character played in the earlier film by her mother Judy Garland) in what would have been her first major role had it been released as originally scheduled in 1964—the Filmation production took eight years to finish due to financial difficulties and would ultimately be released between 1972 and 1974.

She returned to Broadway in 1997, taking over the title role in the musical Victor/Victoria, replacing Julie Andrews. In his review, New York Times critic Ben Brantley commented, "her every stage appearance is perceived as a victory of show-business stamina over psychic frailty. She asks for love so nakedly and earnestly, it seems downright vicious not to respond." In 1995 Minnelli and long time collaborator Billy Stritch recorded a number of American standards "unplugged", and were coveted by many to be the Holy Grail of Minnelli's career, showing a sultrier and softer, more interpretive side to her artistry. The songs were later released in 2010, making the album "Confessions". After a serious case of viral encephalitis in 2000, doctors predicted that she would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair and would perhaps not even be able to speak again.

Minnelli told reporters, "I am stable as a table." Gest was so impressed with her stamina and ability to stun audiences that he produced her in Liza's Back in spring 2002 performing to rave reviews in London and New York City. (Most noted in that tour was a tribute to her mother. After years of declining fans' pleas for her to sing Garland's signature song, "Over The Rainbow", she concluded Act 1 with the final refrain of her mother's famous anthem, to an instant ovation.) Among performing her classic hits, other numbers unreleased in the album version included "I Believe You" by The Carpenters, a rap version of "Liza With A 'Z'", "Yes", and Mary J. Blige's "Family Affair", 2001. VH1 signed on Minnelli and Gest in 2002 to appear in a reality show entitled Liza & David.
