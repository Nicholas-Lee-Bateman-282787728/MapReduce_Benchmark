    Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology (abbreviated RHIT), formerly Rose Polytechnic Institute, is a small private college specializing in teaching engineering, mathematics and science. It has been ranked number one in the nation for undergraduate engineering (terminal Master's degress institution) by U.S. News & World Report for the last seventeen years. Its  campus is located in Terre Haute, Indiana. Founder Chauncey Rose, along with nine friends, created the Terre Haute School of Industrial Science in 1874 to provide technical training after encountering difficulties in local engineer availability during construction of his railroads. Mr. Rose donated the land on 13th and Locust St. and the majority of the funds needed to start the new school. A year later, the cornerstone of the new institution was laid and the name was changed to Rose Polytechnic Institute despite the objections of the president of the board of managers and chief benefactor, Mr. Rose. The original campus was a single building, with no dormitories or recreational facilities. The first class of 48 students entered in 1883, chosen from 58 applicants. Of the 48 students, all were male, and 37 came from Indiana. All but four students chose to major in Mechanical Engineering with Civil Engineering and Chemistry the only other majors. Nearly half of the original students would eventually quit their studies before graduation for a number of reasons, including poor grades or conduct. The first president was Dr. Charles O. Thompson, who modeled the education of Rose Poly after eastern institutions. Rose Poly was thus founded as the first private engineering college west of the Alleghenies. During the beginning years of the school, money was a major concern. A lot of faculty and staff were forced to take pay cuts in order to stay at the institution. In 1889 the school awarded what it considers to be the first Chemical Engineering degree in the country. In 1917, the school, having grown to more than 300 students, moved from 13th and Locust St. (on which now sits Chauncey Rose Middle School) to a new site consisting of  of farm land on U.S. 40 donated by the Hulman family of Terre Haute. The cornerstone of the new campus was laid in 1922. The new campus consisted of an academic building and the institute's first dorm, Deming Hall, which is still used by freshman today. Early life at Rose consisted of social fraternities, athletics, and the occasional "high jinks." A popular "high jinks" involved the sophomore class inviting the freshmen class to a baseball game but were told to "leave their pipes with the nurse." The freshmen would produce the pipes at a specific time and a brawl would ensue. During World War I Rose Poly trained students in technical subjects like vehicle maintenance, and created a ROTC Engineer unit. During World War II the ROTC unit was replaced with an Army Specialized Training Unit and students could enter and graduate after every quarter in order to support the war effort. This enrollment schedule continued through the post-war years until 1951. A tank was located behind the north sides of Moench Hall and Myers Hall as a reminder of Rose Poly's war contributions, but has recently been moved from the campus for reasons unknown. In recognition of the Hulman family's significant contributions and continued financial support, Rose Polytechnic was renamed Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology in 1971. During the 1960s and 70s, growth accelerated under president John A. Logan. Five new residence halls, a new student union, library, and a student recreation center were all constructed between 1963 and 1976. Permission was sought and received to increase the student population to 1000. The quarterly cryptology journal Cryptologia was founded and published at RHIT from 1977 to 1995, at which time it was moved   to the United States Military Academy. For most of its history, Rose–Hulman was a men's-only institution. It voted to become coeducational in 1991, with the first women students starting in 1995. Also in 1995, the college required all incoming freshmen to purchase laptop computers, becoming one of the first schools to do so. Since then, laptops have been required for all freshmen, and the curricula have heavily integrated computers into classroom instruction. In the decade following 1995, Rose–Hulman's growth was aided by a major fundraising campaign called "Vision to be the Best." Originally a $100 million campaign over ten years, it met its goal in half the time. The goal was extended to $200 million, and by the end of the campaign in June 2004, over $250 million had been raised. In 2002, Hatfield Hall, a state-of-the-art theater and alumni center was opened. Five years earlier Shook Field House was replaced with the $20 million Sports and Recreation Center, which is a major reason that the National Football League's Indianapolis Colts used the campus for their summer training camp from 1999–2010. After the 2004 retirement of institute president Samuel Hulbert, who had led the school since 1976, the college faced a leadership crisis. Soon after John J. Midgley arrived as the new president, rumors of conflict between Midgley and the administration started to circulate. Students, some wearing T-shirts proclaiming "Hit the Road Jack", held a rally calling for Midgley's resignation. Dr. Midgley resigned as president of the institute on June 11, 2005, less than a year into his presidency, after the faculty, staff, and Student Government Association approved votes of no confidence. During the succeeding academic year, Robert Bright, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, served as interim chief executive officer. At a press conference on March 17, 2006, Mr. Bright named Gerald Jakubowski, Vice President and Professor of Engineering at Arizona State University, as the thirteenth president of the Institute. Dr. Jakubowski took over effective July 1, 2006. Dr. Jakubowski was respectfully referred to as "Dr. J." by the students and he held meetings with those interested a few times during the year to catch up on campus life. On February 23, 2009, Dr. Jakubowski announced that he would be resigning from the position of president, effective June 30. On June 11, 2009, the college announced that the Board of Trustees had elected Matt Branam to serve as interim president. On December 4, 2009, the Board elected Branam as permanent president. Upon election of Branam as interim, Rose–Hulman began a search for a permanent president which had identified a number of impressive potential candidates. "Early in that process, the Trustees became convinced that it was in the institution's best interest to ask Matt Branam, who has been serving in an interim capacity, to become our permanent president,” said Board Chairman William Fenoglio. With his election, Branam became the 14th president in the 135-year history of the college. Branam brought a wealth of experience and knowledge to Rose–Hulman. His expertise in fundraising, board relations, public relations, brand management, legal, labor, and financial affairs brought Rose–Hulman a seasoned leader. He managed the American Red Cross through a period of tremendous growth and change for its then president, Elizabeth Dole, as its first ever chief operating officer. Branam’s experience also included a distinguished 24-year career with UPS (formerly called United Parcel Service) where his local job as a teenager evolved through numerous positions of increased responsibility, including the position of vice president of public affairs in Washington, D.C. A native of Terre Haute, Ind., Branam has attended Indiana State University, Taylor University and Georgetown University, and he graduated from Rose–Hulman in 1979.http://www.rose-hulman.edu/news/articles/2009MattBranam-14thPresident.htm On April 20, 2012, Branam suffered a heart attack and was rushed to a hospital, where he died shortly afterward.http://tribstar.com/news/x733697528/Rose-mourns-president-s-death The cabinet subsequently selected Robert A. Coons as the Institute’s Interim President. On March 4, 2013, the Rose-Hulman Board of Trustees announced that it named James C. Conwell, PhD, PE, as the institute’s 15th president starting May 1, 2013. His first act as Institute President was to erect stop signs around campus to ensure a safer campus roadway, earning him the nickname "Safety James". With a demanding student body, many of these stop signs were changed to crosswalk signs. He is visible on campus, sometimes seen eating lunch in the Main Dining Hall and greeting students, faculty, and staff when he walks around campus. He has continued to grow the name of Rose-Hulman throughout the nation and the world through his travels. Under his tenure, several new faculty and staff have been hired.   Rose–Hulman's  campus includes a baseball field, a softball field, and a soccer field at the west end, two bodies of water (known on campus as "Scum Pond" and "Speed Lake") surrounded by residence halls in the middle, the academic buildings east of that, and a row of fraternities further to the east. The Sports and Recreation Center (SRC), Cook Stadium, and other sports-related facilities anchor the north side of campus, and Oakley Observatory sits on the far east edge. The entrance of the campus leads to Hadley Hall, the main administrative building. The center of campus is marked by the Grace and Anton Hulman Memorial Union, which includes dining facilities and administrative offices, as well as other campus-run businesses such as the bookstore and game room. Rose–Hulman maintains a safe campus: the crime rate for all of campus is low with only a few incidents reported each year. The Office of Public Safety provides 24-hour security and operates emergency call boxes situated throughout the campus to summon help for emergencies, for the escort service, or to get one's car unlocked to retrieve keys. All of the sidewalks are well lit, and during winter the stairways and sidewalks are kept clear of snow and ice.  There are eleven residence halls on campus: Deming, Baur-Sames-Bogart (BSB), Speed, Mees, Scharpenberg, Blumberg, Skinner, Percopo, the Apartment Style Residence Hall (which consists of Apartments East and Apartments West), and Lakeside Hall. Combined, these halls can provide housing for over 1,100 students. The oldest, Deming Hall, was built in 1926 and is an all-male hall. Deming houses 109 students, mostly freshmen, on four floors, and has no air conditioning. Baur-Sames-Bogart (BSB) Hall, built in 1956, is an L-shaped building with room for 144 students on three stories, mostly freshmen. The offices and studios of the campus radio station occupy much of BSB's basement. There are also some rooms in the basement for upperclass male students.   Speed Hall was built in 1963 and holds 116 male freshmen on three floors, with no air conditioning. North of Speed Hall is Speed Lawn, where many on-campus activities are held, and Speed Lake, a central part of the campus. Mees, Scharpenberg, and Blumberg (all built in 1966) constitute the Triplets. Mees and Blumberg house 76 students each on 4 H-shaped floors and Sharpenberg 70 students on 3 H-shaped floors (Sharpenberg's three first floor rooms were converted into a Graduate Assistant apartment). Mees and Scharpenberg are nearly identical, with Blumberg being a mirror image of the two. Skinner, built in 1976, is an apartment-style residence hall on the east side of campus. Apartments in Skinner were originally composed of three bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room, and a kitchen shared with three other apartments, but were remodeled to have only two bedrooms and a private kitchen. Skinner is the smallest residence hall, housing only 44 students and 2 resident assistants. Skinner is now used for sorority housing, split between the three sororities. Percopo, built in 1999, is mainly a Sophomore-only hall, designed to retain and help educate Sophomore students. Percopo has in-house tutors and other resources geared towards assisting Sophomores through what is generally considered the hardest academic year. Percopo has 109 double-rooms (sharing a bathroom) on four floors. The Apartment Style Residence Hall opened in the fall of 2004. The Apartments actually consist of two halls, referred to as East and West, connected by a commons area. Apartments East and Apartments West are identical, each having suites with two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a living room. The commons area contains a Subway restaurant, a convenience store, lobbies, and laundry facilities. Lakeside Hall is the most recently constructed hall on campus.  The first floor is suite-style similar to Percopo Hall, including two in-house tutors, and the upper three floors are apartment-style.  Lakeside Hall holds 240 students and opened on the fall of 2012. All residence halls are kept clean by the devoted Residence Hall staff. Each room is cleaned once a week by a housekeeper. This cleaning consists of emptying the trash cans, making the beds with clean sheets, wiping the mirrors in the room, cleaning the bathroom, and vacuuming the floor. The lobbies of each hall are cleaned every day by housekeepers and custodians, and the restrooms are cleaned several times a week.  Rose–Hulman has four main classroom buildings plus a library, a mechanical engineering lab, and an administration building. The four main buildings are Moench Hall, Olin Hall, Crapo Hall, and Myers Hall. Olin came as a result of a proposal by Sam Hulbert and was later expanded to add eight more advanced learning classrooms. Olin includes a large occupancy by the Civil Engineering and Chemical Engineering Departments. Crapo is home to the Mathematics Department and has two floors of classrooms. The John T. Myers Center for Technological Research with Industry, the newest academic building, holds the Graduate Studies Office and some Bioengineering Department labs. The lower floor of Meyers hall has been renovated adding new high-tech classrooms to facilitate the growing number of classes offered at Rose. The largest, Moench Hall, is composed of four floors of classrooms, offices, and labs, and was the original academic building on campus built in 1922. All of the remaining departments have offices in Moench. The Logan Library is a small engineering library whose lowest floor is occupied by The Learning Center, with tutors and help available to students, Homework Hotline, and the ROTC offices. Near Myers Hall is the Rotz Mechanical Engineering Lab which houses three wind tunnels and other mechanical engineering labs. Connecting Moench Hall and Olin Hall is Hadley Hall. This building contains the offices of the President, the Registrar, Admissions, and Financial Aid. Rose–Hulman's wireless network covers the academic buildings, Hulman Memorial Union, the Sports and Recreation Center, Logan Library, and the residence halls. In April of 2015, the wireless network was extended to outside the residence halls and academic buildings, especially where seating is available. Every classroom and residence hall room is also equipped with high-speed ethernet connections. Chauncey’s is the campus game room for Rose–Hulman. It is managed and staffed by Rose–Hulman students, with the guidance of the Student Activities Department. It is open to all Rose–Hulman students, faculty, staff, and guests. There are two pool tables, a ping pong table, a foosball table, and recently added an air-hockey table. Rose–Hulman Residence Hall Association provides Chauncey’s with DVD’s that are made available for students to rent at no cost (Currently over 600 titles). The lounge in Chauncey’s is furnished with five big-screen TV’s, and plays host to a number of events. Throughout the year, Chauncey’s hosts several different tournaments and events, including: During the academic year, Chauncey’s is open during the week from 11&nbsp;am to 11&nbsp;pm, and from noon to 11&nbsp;pm on the weekends, except during exams and breaks when schedules change. Public artwork is displayed across the campus. The Flame of the Millennium, designed by Leonardo Nierman, and its surrounding fountain is the largest and one of the newest of the sculptures. Other works can be seen in the Root Quadrangle around Olin, Moench, and Crapo, and opposite Olin toward the south end of campus. Out of all the sculptures around campus, one of the favorites among students is The Call of the Sea, located in the Root Quadrangle near Olin Hall. Many students pose with this sculpture to have their pictures taken. Another campus favorite is the Self-Made Man located near the entrance to the SRC. Paintings and prints can also be found throughout the school. The largest collection is that of the late Omer "Salty" Seamon, a Hoosier watercolorist and illustrator. A 115-piece collection of 19th century British watercolors can be found in the Hulman Memorial Union. The art curator for Rose–Hulman also is in charge of rotating the art collections on the main floors of Moench Hall which are changed during the summer and also over Winter Break. The curricula at RHIT concentrate on engineering and the natural sciences. The school's primary focus is undergraduate education, though there is a small graduate program for master's degree students. There are no doctoral programs. In 2005, Rose–Hulman had 161 faculty members, 99% of whom held a PhD. The current student-to-faculty ratio is 13:1. Admission to the institute remains competitive due to its self-selecting admissions class and applicant sharing with Purdue, and other top universities. In 2013, 561 students enrolled out of over 5,046 applicants. The school currently operates on three academic quarters plus an optional summer session. Rose-Hulman is a member of the College Consortium of Western Indiana. This membership allows students who are full-time at their home institution to take classes at the other member institutions of Indiana State University and Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College. The Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Optical Engineering, and Software Engineering programs are accredited by The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Rose–Hulman is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and by the Department of Public Instruction of the State of Indiana. The Chemistry curriculum has been approved by the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society. In addition to institutional membership in the American Society for Engineering Education, the Institute is also a member of the Association of Independent Technological Universities, a group formed to further the interests of private engineering schools. As of 2015, the institute has been ranked #1 among engineering colleges whose highest degree offered is a Bachelors's or Master's by U.S. News & World Report for 17 consecutive years. Each individual program assessed has also been ranked first since the magazine has published individual rankings. These programs are the Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Mechanical, and, as of the 2016 ranking, Biomedical engineering programs.http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/spec-engineering The student body tends to come mostly from the Midwest United States, though as the school has gained prominence it has gradually attracted a more geographically and ethnically diverse applicant pool. 39% of students hail from the state of Indiana with large numbers of students from the nearby states of Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Minnesota. A 2003 gift of $7 million from an alumnus was specifically established to increase geographic diversity. International students currently make up about 3% of the student body. Approximately 23% of students are female. A sizable population is involved in Army and Air Force ROTC programs. There are eight social fraternities and three social sororities, some of which have their houses on campus. The fraternities are: Alpha Tau Omega, Delta Sigma Phi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Nu, Theta Xi, and Triangle. The sororities are Delta Delta Delta, Chi Omega, and Alpha Omicron Pi. As of 2003, nearly 69% of the students were members of Greek social organizations. Various academic, honor and service organizations are also represented, including Alpha Chi Sigma, Alpha Lambda Delta, Alpha Phi Omega, Eta Kappa Nu, Pi Mu Epsilon, Pi Tau Sigma, Sigma Pi Sigma, Tau Beta Pi and Upsilon Pi Epsilon. There are currently eight different performing arts groups on campus: Chorus, Drama Club, String Ensemble, Jazz Band, Concert Band, Pep Band, Saxophone Choir, and Brass Quintet. All of the groups use the recently constructed Hatfield Hall for performances, rehearsal space, and storage. Most performing arts groups have published recordings used to recruit prospective students and promote the school's performing arts programs. In addition to these groups, Rose–Hulman also has the Performing Arts Series which brings mainstream acts to Hatfield Hall for the cultural enrichment of both the campus and community. Recent acts have included Jack Hanna, the Harlem Gospel Choir, and the East Village Opera Company all of whose shows sold out completely in only a few days. The 2013 Performing Arts Series is expected to be a success with many shows selling out due to the expected popularity of the shows including MOMIX, the Russian National Ballet, and John Pizzarelli. The Rose Chorus performs many times throughout the year including the National Anthem before the Homecoming football game, the Golden Gala dinner during Homecoming weekend, three concerts a year, commencement ceremonies, and either Mom's Day or Dad's Day festivities. The Rose Drama Club (RDC) performs many times throughout the year including fall and winter plays, a spring musical, a 24-hour play festival (where plays are written, rehearsed, and performed in 24 hours), and one-acts. Recent productions include The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940, Night of the Living Dead, Once Upon a Mattress, The Three Musketeers, The Wizard of Oz, and Chicago. RDC's 2013 shows include Jekyll and Hyde and Cats. As most Rose students are engineering majors, the drama club prides itself on its technical theater group and their special effects. The Rose Jazz Band plays different styles of jazz from a jazzy Let it Snow to Tank. Rehearsals usually go on Tuesday evenings for about 2 hours. It is currently led by Norm Hanson. The Rose Saxophone Choir is a new performing group (the other being the Brass Quintet) established in 2012. Currently consisting of 8 members, the Rose Sax Choir performs with the other performing groups at most Hatfield Hall concerts. Soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones create a lively atmosphere in each performance. It is currently led by Chemical Engineer Dustin. "Dear Old Rose" the Rose Polytechnic Institute school song, arranged by Malcolm C Scott, class of 1922, and melody by "Beta Rose"http://visions.indstate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/rose&CISOPTR=17617&CISOBOX=1&REC=2 Dear Old Rose Dear Old Rose The sweetest flower that grows Here's to your colors rose and white Here's to the ones who've kept them bright. Colors true for those who honor you Here's to everything you've done, Here's to every fight you've won. Dear old Rose. It is performed by the Pep Band and sung only at football and basketball games after a victory.   There are many facilities for sports events. The Sports and Recreation Center (SRC) is home to basketball courts, racquetball courts, an indoor track, an 8-lane,  swimming and diving pool, a weight-lifting room, a basketball arena (Hulbert Arena), and a multi-use room (for dance, wrestling, etc.). Outside of the SRC is Cook Stadium and its football field surrounded by the William Welch Outdoor Track & Field Complex. Inside of Cook Stadium grandstand is the RHIT rifle range. Adjacent to the football field is a series of tennis courts as well as two intramural fields (used by the Indianapolis Colts during their summer training camp) near these courts. Rose–Hulman's sports facilities also include the Art Nehf baseball field, a softball field, and the Jim Rendel soccer field. In 2007 and 2009, the SRC was home to the Division III Men's and Women's Indoor National Track Championships, after having previously hosted the Division III Women's Basketball National Championships in 2002 and 2003. Rose–Hulman currently competes in the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference (HCAC), an NCAA Division III athletic conference. It was previously a member of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC) and Indiana Collegiate Athletic Conference (ICAC), the latter now known as the HCAC. Despite no longer sharing a conference affiliation with the SCAC, Rose–Hulman has always had a rivalry with DePauw University, and has consistently had nonleague rivalries with other nearby strong academic schools such as Washington University in St. Louis, University of Chicago, and Denison University. The men and women's Swimming and Diving team participates in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin. The colors of the Rose–Hulman Fightin' Engineers are rose and white, and their mascot is Rosie the Elephant. As of 2005, Rose–Hulman has had a student athlete named to an NCAA Division III Academic All-America Team for 21 consecutive years. Sixty-four Academic All-Americans have been named from the school since 1978. For the 2007–2008 school year, Rose–Hulman won the Commissioner's Cup from the HCAC. This award is given to the school with the most number of points based on the teams performance in the conference. The Rose–Hulman football program was started in the year of 1882. That year, Rose (then known simply as Rose Polytechnic Institute) played one game against Wabash College which they lost 12–0. In the early years, Rose played the likes of the University of Notre Dame, Purdue University, University of Illinois, Indiana University, and Indiana Normal School, which is now Indiana State University. Led by head coach Steve Englehart and senior Quarterback Derek Eitel, Rose–Hulman finished the 2009 season with a 6–4 record. After that season concluded a coaching change was made and Jeff Sokol became the new leader of Rose-Hulman's football team.  He has one HCAC conference championship under his belt that he won in 2013. He is still the head coach now and his record for 2014 was 7-3. Baseball first made an appearance at Rose–Hulman in 1888. Since then, the baseball team has been a mainstay on the Rose–Hulman campus except for the stretch of time between 1929 and 1947 when Rose–Hulman could not field a team. In 2008, the team received a bid to the NCAA Division III Mideastern Regional Tournament which was held at Art Nehf Field on the campus of Rose–Hulman. The regional tournament has also been held on Rose–Hulman's campus in 2005 and 2006. The team also won the HCAC Conference Tournament, receiving and automatic bid to the NCAA Division III Mideastern Regional Tournament. In 2008, 2009, and 2010 the Engineers won their first game, all started by Derek Eitel, before losing the following two to be eliminated from the tournament. The Women's soccer team was the 2007 HCAC Champions and made an appearance in the NCAA Division III Tournament in the same season. They repeated at the regular season conference champions in 2009. They also have record of 98–45–6 since. The Men's soccer team was the best team in the HCAC regular season in 2008 and 2009 and 2nd in 2006 and 2007, making the program's first ever appearance in the NCAA Division III National Soccer Tournament in 2008. They also have a record of 53–21–7 between 2006 and 2009. The Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology swimming and diving program has earned regional respect and achieved national accomplishments during the past decade. Rose–Hulman’s swimming and diving resume features one national champion, six All-American awards and 64 all-conference awards since 1998. The men’s squad finished either third or fourth in the nationally competitive Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference for eight consecutive years, while the women improved from seventh to fourth in the 2005 campaign. The accomplishments include 17 provisional national qualification times, 11 conference champions and four individual swimmers competing at the NCAA Division III National Championships. Rose–Hulman’s ascent to national prominence began in 1999, when Sean Valentine captured the first two All-American awards in school history. Valentine placed fourth in the  freestyle and sixth in the  breaststroke at the NCAA Division III Nationals. Matt Smith became Rose–Hulman’s first swimming national champion in 2003. Smith’s career included four All-American honors, highlighted by a first place in the  breaststroke in 2003. He captured eight individual league championships, including three  breaststroke titles. David Breiding, a 2004 graduate, also qualified for the NCAA Division III National Championships during a career that featured nine individual all-conference awards. Adam Effinger continued the tradition with a pair of honorable mention All-American efforts at the 2006 NCAA Division III National Championships. The women’s swimming and diving team earned its first significant regional and national accolades in 2005. The  medley relay team of Jessica Frank, Anita Isch, Elaine Kratz and Erin O’Connor earned the first national provisional qualification in the history of the women’s program and captured all-conference honors. The all-conference accolades continued with two individual and one relay award in 2006. In 2013 the Fightin' Engineers set 20 school records at the CCIW Championships and had 15 provisional and automatic NCAA Division III National Qualifiers, sending 2 to the National Championships in the  butterfly.http://www.rose-hulman.edu/athletics/swimming-diving/2012-13-game-stories/swimming-diving-completes-historic-cciw-weekend.aspx The track and field squads has grown into a strong program, more and more talented athletes coming in each year. Ten national titles have won by our Engineers, with the most recent coming from 2013 graduate Liz Evans winning five of the titles. While the women's program has won the HCAC title in 2011, the dominating men's program has won the HCAC title straight from 2008 to 2013. The recent individual successes include the two-time National Champion 1998 graduate pole vaulter Ryan Loftus, 2007 graduate pole vaulter Ryan Schipper placing 3rd in the 2007 NCAA Outdoor Championships, and 2012 graduate Sutton Coleman earning 7 All American Honors in 4 different track events. Recent Graduate Liz Evans became Rose Hulman's most decorated athlete with 8 All American honors, 5 National Championship titles, 6 HCAC Field Athlete of the Year awards, and 5 USTFCCCA Great Lakes Regional Field Athlete of the Year honors. She earned two bachelor's degrees in mathematics and electrical engineering. Rose Hulman has developed into a nationally ranked program competing against some of the largest universities in the nation. They are a member of the Western Intercollegiate Rifle Conference. They have had two coaches, Kenny Hitt and James Mills earn coach of the year honors. The campus radio station was WMHD-FM 90.7 FM, "The Monkey." Until recently, the station broadcast with a very low power antenna on campus, but now operates an off-site transmitter at 1400 Watts. The studio facilities are in the basement of the BSB residence hall. The station was operated entirely by student volunteers, and all disc jockeys choose their own format and playlists. In August 2014, the station was sold to Indiana State University. The school is served by an independently-funded, student-run newspaper, The Rose Thorn, that focuses on campus news. The Rose–Hulman Film Club currently produces student-directed short films. In the last few years, students have led an initiative to start a campus television station, RoseView, although currently this station does not exist. Rose also has an amateur radio club callsign W9NAA. The college operates several educational and entrpreneurial outreach programs. The Homework Hotline provides free homework help and tutoring to Indiana middle school and high school students. Thirty Rose–Hulman students per night field calls from around the state and help students answer math and science questions. In the 2007–08 school year, the hotline received a total of 44,151 calls. The hotline also conducted over 3000 online tutoring sessions. The program started in 1991 and is funded by the Lilly Endowment, Inc. and Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology. In 1968, the college launched Operation Catapult, a science-based summer camp for rising high school seniors. The eighteen day program is designed to immerse students into the role of an engineer attempting to solve problems posed by their group's project. It continues today. In 1977, the college held the first summer computer camp in the nation for high school students, Camp Retupmoc ('computer' spelled backwards). This camp continues through the summer of 2009, with Operation Catapult LXXXVI, with intent to continue further. The 1980s also saw "T.I.P.," The Iceberg Project, a summer camp for rising high school seniors lasting a week and a half, where students were given detailed introductions to scientific areas of interest such as game theory, computer programming, or qualitative chemical analysis. The T.I.P. program was short-lived. PRISM (Portal Resources for Indiana Science and Mathematics), is a free web portal run by the school for teachers of sixth to eighth grade science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in Indiana. The project is also funded by the Lilly Endowment. Rose–Hulman Ventures is an engineering educational experience located at Rose–Hulman's South Campus, three miles (5&nbsp;km) south of the main campus. It serves as a source of internships and job opportunities with startups and established companies of all sizes for Rose students and alumni. From 1999–2009, 749 students have worked as interns for 117 companies. Rose–Hulman Ventures was established in 1999 with a $30 million grant from the Lilly Endowment and received a $24.9 million follow-up grant in 2002. Rose–Hulman Ventures Website There are many activities and clubs at Rose–Hulman, but there are several engineering projects that frequently take the spotlight. The institute has an Advanced Transportation Initiative that has attracted national attention. With its close proximity to the most prominent automotive and transportation companies in the United States, Rose–Hulman is able to partner with companies to integrate current technology and industry developments into the curriculum beyond senior projects so that students can have a four-year experience understanding the engineering world. The team at Rose–Hulman was initially created to compete in the Challenge X competition. ChallengeX was a competition among 17 Universities in the United States and Canada that partner with General Motors and the Department of Energy to re-engineer a 2005 Chevrolet Equinox to improve fuel efficiency and decrease emissions. The team ranges from 30–70 students and has been an integral part of the Universities Mechanical & Electrical Engineering programs. The vehicle uses a power-split hybrid architecture as the team modified their vehicle into a rear wheel drive diesel-electric hybrid using B20 biodiesel fuel. The university allows them to use a designated section of the Rotz Lab on campus as team headquarters. Students receive course credit for this project. Rose–Hulman ChallengeX Team Website The start of the 2008–2009 school year brought with it a new challenge, EcoCAR. The EcoCAR challenge is a three-year competition that is the latest in the 19-year history of the Department of Energy advanced vehicle competitions. Rose–Hulman competes with 16 other schools throughout the United States and Canada to reengineer a Saturn Vue crossover. Rose–Hulman EcoCAR Team Website Rose-Hulman Efficient Vehicles Team (RHEV) is composed of around 15 students majoring in mechanical and electrical engineering. The goal of this team is to develop a prototype vehicle with very high gas mileage. The team competes in both the Shell Eco-Marathon and the SAE Supermileage competition each year. The driver lays flat on his or her back and steers the car by adjusting independent front wheel mechanisms. The vehicles are driven by a single rear wheel that’s attached to a 1 to 2 horsepower motor, located behind the driver’s compartment. The Rose-Hulman Human Powered Vehicle Team constructs a man-powered land vehicle to compete in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers' Human Powered Vehicle Challenge. The vehicle must be light, highly efficient and powered only by its single occupant. The team at Rose–Hulman is a volunteer engineering club. The team has competed for five years. The first year, the "Hautian Hazard" gave a strong showing at the sprint and endurance events. However, due to a low design report score, the team only received 7th place at the ASME East Coast competition. The second year, the "R5" came on strong and took second place overall at the ASME East Coast competition. It was clocked at over  in the sprint event. It also had a sustained one-hour endurance speed of  at an HPRA event. The 2008 bike, "Infinity", has performed extremely well at the both the East and West Coast ASME competitions. The team achieved first place overall at West Coast by earning a first-place finish in the women's sprint and design report, second place in the men's sprint, and third place in the endurance event. In the men's sprint the vehicle traveled at  through a 100-meter time trap. The team also achieved first place overall at the East Coast Competition by earning a first-place finish in the men's sprint, second place in the women's sprint and endurance event, and third place in the design report. Rose–Hulman was the second team ever to win both the East and West Coast ASME competitions in the same year. The team continued to win in 2009 and 2010, winning the both the ASME East and ASME West Human-Powered Vehicle Challenge in each year. The vehicles built were dubbed "Mark IV" and "Ragnarök", respectively. In 2010, the team competed in a new vehicle class, Unrestricted, which required more practicality from the competing vehicles. In 2011, Rose–Hulman will be hosting the ASME HPVC East Coast competition.
