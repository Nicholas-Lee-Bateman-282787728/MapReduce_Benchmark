Paulina stated that if the child was a boy, he would be named after his father, Nicolás. If it was a girl, she would be named after Rubio's great-grandmother, Micaela. On 15 September 2010 Paulina announced on her Twitter page that she was expecting a boy. On Sunday, 14 November 2010, Rubio and her husband welcomed their first child, a boy named Andrea Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera Rubio in Miami, Florida. Prior to the birth, Rubio had planned on having a water birth at home, but was rushed to the hospital and spent the weekend with doctors working to stabilize the health of the baby. Hospital staff tried to send Rubio home so that she could realize her dream of a natural home birth, but the complications lead her medical team to schedule a c-section. On 11 January 2011, her father, Enrique Rubio González, died at the age of 67 in a Mexico City hospital. A consensus of various news sources attributed his death to kidney failure. In March 2012, Rubio's husband told Hola! that he and the singer were separating after nearly five years of marriage. "It has been a decision by both of us, though it’s possible that I have been more firm when it came to carrying it out," he said in an interview with the Spanish publication. "I have the feeling there is no going back", Vallejo-Nájera said, disclosing that he and Rubio had been living apart since November and that their only communication with each other was about their son, Andrea Nicolás, born in November 2010. Nevertheless, Colate said that he will always be "grateful to Paulina" for their time together. The divorce was finalized on March 2013. In 2013, Rubio began dating Mexican singer Gerardo Bazúa, a former contestant from her team on La Voz...
