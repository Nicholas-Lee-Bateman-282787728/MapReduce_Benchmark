  The American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA) is a fraternal organization founded on July 26, 1922, in Atlanta, Georgia. AHEPA was founded in response to the evils of bigotry spearheaded by the Ku Klux Klan and to assist Greek immigrants assimilate into American society.  AHEPA joined with B'nai B'rith and the NAACP to combat discrimination. The mission of the AHEPA family is to promote Hellenism, education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, and family and individual excellence. An important component of AHEPA's mission is to create an awareness of the principles of Hellenism to society. These principles include a commitment to humanity, freedom, and democracy.  The preservation and promotion of these ideals is where AHEPA has, and always will be, deeply committed. AHEPA educates the community on these matters through symposia, forums, and conferences. AHEPA's commitment to education has been well documented throughout its history. Over $4 million is endowed at the local, district and national levels toward the use of scholarships and a half-million dollars is awarded annually. Thousands of young men and women have benefited as recipients of AHEPA scholarships at these various levels. The most famous recipient, perhaps, is ABC News' host of This Week, George Stephanopoulos. The scholarship program at the national level is administered by the AHEPA National Educational Foundation. It offers scholarships to a wide variety of students. Recipients are: traditional and non-traditional students; seminarians, including those entering Holy Cross Greek School of Theology; and high school seniors, college and post-graduate students who are looking to become tomorrow's leaders. The preservation of Hellenic or Classical Studies programs on college campuses is an important issue for the AHEPA Educational Foundation. A subcommittee of the Foundation, the Hellenic Cultural Commission, actively works to support the study of the Classics at universities. In addition, educational programs such as "Journey to Greece" and Washington internships are sponsored by the Foundation. Philanthropy and volunteerism have been pillars of strength for AHEPA.  From natural disaster relief to raising funds for the elimination of life-threatening diseases to making significant contributions to their local neighborhoods, AHEPA is at the forefront of charitable giving. AHEPA's philanthropic deeds are evident in the restoration of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island; in the Halls of St. Basil Academy, a childcare facility in Garrison, N.Y.; in the care packages sent to the troops in cooperation with the USO; and in the building of healthcare facilities in Greece.  Yet this only scratches the surface of the numerous philanthropic works of the association.  In addition, countless charitable projects are undertaken every year by AHEPA's chapters and districts. AHEPA grassroots has a strong voice.  With chapters in every major metropolitan city and in rural areas of North America, AHEPA communicates the positions of the Greek-American community to elected representatives at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as to diplomatic leaders.  These issues pertain to Greece, Cyprus, and Turkey; however, AHEPA constituents are also interested in domestic policy areas affecting the philanthropic, civic, and community service-based programs in which they are involved.  These positions are based upon the American heritage and ideals with the best interest of the United States in mind. AHEPA educates its constituents about these issues through seminars and conferences, providing expert panelists from the U.S. government, Washington, DC think-tank organizations, and the business world. Furthermore, AHEPA keeps a watchful eye on Congress with its Congressional Scorecard, a tool that evaluates each member of Congress on Greek-American issues. What makes AHEPA unique from other organizations is the creation of the AHEPA Family. Together with three affiliated organizations, the AHEPA Family works as a unit toward the fulfillment of a common mission.  Combined, the four organizations have contributed well over a billion dollars to national projects throughout their history. Its affiliate women's organization, the Daughters of Penelope, was founded in 1929. It supports two youth groups, the Sons of Pericles (established in 1926) and the Maids of Athena (1930). The Daughters of Penelope was established November 16, 1929 as the Women's Affiliate of AHEPA. It is the first Greek-American women's organization in the United States. One of its crowning achievements is Penelope House, a shelter for battered women in Mobile, Alabama. It is the first shelter for battered women and their children in that state. The Sons of Pericles was established February 3, 1926, and was officially recognized as the Junior Order of AHEPA in 1928. Finally, the Maids of Athena was founded July 5, 1930 as the Junior Women's Auxiliary of AHEPA. The two youth groups have combined to contribute to such worthy causes as: Muscular dystrophy, Deborah Heart and Lung Foundation, the Special Olympics, St. Basil Academy and Cooley's anemia research. AHEPA members are proud of the contributions the ancient Greeks gifted to Western Civilization.  As Americans, they share many of the values put forth by them: civic responsibility, philanthropy, education, family and individual excellence, and the ideals of democracy.  This is the essence of their heritage.  This is the core of the AHEPA mission.http://ahepa.org/ahepa/about.html Moreover, throughout the span of its history, AHEPA has served as a vital vehicle for the progressive development and emergence of American citizens of Greek heritage into every facet of society: government, business, education, and the arts.  This fulfillment illustrates the promise of the American Dream and symbolizes the hard work ethic of immigrant forbears who labored to achieve that dream with the principles of Hellenism rooted deep in their hearts. The AHEPA was founded as a fraternity in Atlanta, Georgia in July 1922.  Its initial mission was to promote the image of Greeks in America, assist them with citizenship and assimilation into American culture, and combat prejudice. With the full assimilation of Greek Americans, its mission evolved toward philanthropy, education, and promoting and preserving the Hellenic identity of the Greek Americans and the ethnic Greeks of other countries where AHEPA is present, such as Australia, Canada, the Bahamas as well as Greece and Cyprus.Alan Axelrod, International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders, New York: Facts on File, 1997, pp.4-5AHEPA Districts and chapters  The founders of the fraternity were eight men, all residents of Atlanta, who conceived the idea of the establishment of an association of mainly citizens of Greek descent, although not limited only to such members. The eight founders of the Order of AHEPA who were also the first Supreme lodge were the following: The office of Supreme President is the highest office in the Order of AHEPA.

Local units were called "Subordinate Lodges" and state or territory structures were called "Superior Lodges". Now local groups are called "Chapters" and regional organizations are called "Districts". The national structure is still called the "Supreme Lodge", however, and all of its officers have "Supreme" in their title such as Supreme President, Supreme Treasurer etc.Schmidt, Alvin J. Fraternal Organizations Westport, CT; Greenwood Press pp.23,25 The Order of AHEPA has over 400 chapters across the United States, Canada, and Europe. In addition, the chapters report to 28 different districts. Those 28 districts report to the Supreme Lodge and Headquarters located in Washington, DC. The first 100 chapters: Chapters 101 to 200: Chapters 201 to 300: Chapters 301 to 400: Chapters 401 to 500: Chapters 501 to 600: - INTERNATIONAL CHAPTERS -  Canadian Chapters: Greece Chapters: Cyprus chapters: Other international chapters: Special Chapters: University Chapters: While membership was originally restricted to Greeks, it was decided to allow non-Greeks into the order at the orders third meeting. In 1979 AHEPA had over 25,000 members in 400 chapters.Schmidt p.25 By 1989, the number climbed to 60,000, despite an overall decline in memberships of fraternal groups during the same period.Axelrod p.5 There have been 540 chapters chartered in the United States, 16 chartered in Canada, 30 chartered in Greece, 5 chartered in Cyprus, and 10 chartered in Europe, Central America, and Caribbean. There are “sister” chapters in AHEPA Australasia (Australia and New Zealand). An estimated 250,000 men have been inducted into the Order of AHEPA over its 90-year history.AHEPA membership fact sheet via AHEPA HQ in Washington, DC In accordance with the provisions of the AHEPA Constitution, the Supreme Convention of the Order of AHEPA shall be the highest constituted body of the entire AHEPA; it shall remain in session until it is adjourned by a majority of its members; its powers over the entire Order shall be limited only by the AHEPA Constitution and the AHEPA BYLAWS, over which it shall have the exclusive power to alter; and it shall consist, in its composite whole, of the "Voting Members of the Convention".

For each Congress, AHEPA compiles a Congressional scorecard on issues of importance to the American Hellenic community and to the organization.  The purpose of the scorecard is to educate AHEPA’s membership and the community on how engaged members of Congress are on these issues, or at the least, their level of awareness. AHEPA is very active in fulfilling the mission of the organization. Here is a list of AHEPA projects over its 92-year history:AHEPA fact sheet via AHEPA HQ in Washington, DC AHEPA recognizes distinguished achievements in various categories such as Public Service, Government, Law, Business, Journalism, Science, the Arts, Military Service, Humanitarian.

This is the most prestigious award AHEPA awards. AHEPA’s premier social event, the AHEPA National Banquet, was held for the first time on February 26, 1929, at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC. In 1948, the name of the event was changed to the “AHEPA Congressional Banquet” and for the first time, a United States President, Harry Truman, attended. In 2000 AHEPA reverted to a more appropriate name of this event, The AHEPA Biennial Banquet. Since 1964, the AHEPA National Banquet has also featured presentations of the organization’s most coveted honor, the Socrates Award.

Kofos, established the AHEPA Athletic Hall of Fame to honor outstanding Hellenic athletes and sports personages. As of 2013, 130 members have been inducted. Annually, a representative and diverse of  Ahepans appointed by the Supreme Athletic Director select worthy and eligible candidates for induction, after a nomination process pursuant to established written guidelines for both nomination and selection. The hallmarks of said process are objectivity, transparency and accountability.
