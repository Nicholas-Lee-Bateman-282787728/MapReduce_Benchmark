    The history of feminism is the chronological narrative of the movements and ideologies aimed at equal rights for women. While feminists around the world have differed in causes, goals, and intentions depending on time, culture, and country, most Western feminist historians assert that all movements that work to obtain women's rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves. Other historians limit the term to the modern feminist movement and its progeny, and instead use the label "protofeminist" to describe earlier movements. Modern Western feminist history is split into three time periods, or "waves", each with slightly different aims based on prior progress. First-wave feminism of the 19th and early 20th centuries focused on overturning legal inequalities, particularly women's suffrage. Second-wave feminism (1960s–1980s) broadened debate to include cultural inequalities, gender norms, and the role of women in society. Third-wave feminism (1990s–2000s) refers to diverse strains of feminist activity, seen as both a continuation of the second wave and a response to its perceived failures.Krolokke, Charlotte and Anne Scott Sorensen, "From Suffragettes to Grrls" in Gender Communication Theories and Analyses: From Silence to Performance (Sage, 2005). Although the waves construct has been commonly used to describe the history of feminism, the concept has also been criticized for ignoring and erasing the history between the "waves", by choosing to focus solely on a few famous figures and popular events.    People and activists who discussed or advanced women's equality prior to the existence of the feminist movement are sometimes labeled protofeminist. Some scholars, however, criticize this term's usage.Cott, Nancy F. "What's In a Name? The Limits of ‘Social Feminism’; or, Expanding the Vocabulary of Women's History". Journal of American History 76 (December 1989): 809–829 Some argue that it diminishes the importance of earlier contributions, while others argue that feminism does not have a single, linear history as implied by terms such as protofeminist or postfeminist. Around 24 centuries ago,The Columbia Encyclopedia (Columbia Univ. Press, 5th ed. 1993(ISBN 0-395-62438-X)), entry Plato. Plato, according to Elaine Hoffman Baruch, "[argued] for the total political and sexual equality of women, advocating that they be members of his highest class,&nbsp;... those who rule and fight".Baruch, Elaine Hoffman, Women in Men's Utopias, in Rohrlich, Ruby, & Elaine Hoffman Baruch, eds., Women in Search of Utopia, op. cit., p.

French writer Christine de Pizan (1364 – c. 1430), the author of The Book of the City of Ladies and Epître au Dieu d'Amour (Epistle to the God of Love) is cited by Simone de Beauvoir as the first woman to denounce misogyny and write about the relation of the sexes. Other early feminist writers include Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi, who worked in the 16th century, and the 17th-century writers Hannah Woolley in England,  Juana Inés de la Cruz in Mexico, Marie Le Jars de Gournay, Anne Bradstreet, and François Poullain de la Barre. One of the most important 17th-century feminist writers in the English language was Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.[Kegl, Rosemary. “'The World I Have Made': Margaret Cavendish, feminism and the Blazing World", in Valerie Traub, M. Lindsay Kaplan, and Dympna Callaghan (eds), Feminist Readings of Early Modern Culture: Emerging Subjects, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 119-141.]Martin Griffiths 31 August 2008.

Huntington Library Quarterly. Vol. 47, No. 4 (Autumn, 1984), pp. 289-307. The Age of Enlightenment was characterized by secular intellectual reasoning and a flowering of philosophical writing. Many Enlightenment philosophers defended the rights of women, including Jeremy Bentham (1781), Marquis de Condorcet (1790), and, perhaps most notably, Mary Wollstonecraft (1792).Tomalin, Claire. The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft. 144–155. Rev. ed. 1974. New York: Penguin, 1992. ISBN 0-14-016761-7 Other important writers of the time that expressed feminist views included Catharine Macaulay and Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht. The English utilitarian and classical liberal philosopher Jeremy Bentham said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose the career of a reformist at the age of eleven. Bentham spoke for complete equality between sexes including the rights to vote and to participate in government. He opposed the asymmetrical sexual moral standards between men and women.Miriam Williford, Bentham on the rights of Women In his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (1781), Bentham strongly condemned many countries' common practice to deny women's rights due to allegedly inferior minds.Miriam Williford, Bentham on the rights of Women, Journal of the History of Ideas, 1975. Bentham gave many examples of able female regents. Nicolas de Condorcet was a mathematician, classical liberal politician, leading French Revolutionary, republican, and Voltairean anti-clericalist. He was also a fierce defender of human rights, including the equality of women and the abolition of slavery, unusual for the 1780s. He advocated for women's suffrage in the new government in 1790 with De l'admission des femmes au droit de cité (For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women) and an article for Journal de la Société de 1789.Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship (1790), The First Essay on the Political Rights of Women. A Translation of Condorcet’s Essay “Sur l’admission des femmes aux droits de Cité” (On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship). By Dr. Alice Drysdale Vickery (with preface and remarks) (Letchworth: Garden City Press, 1912).David Williams,"Condorcet, Feminism, and the Egalitarian Principle." Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture 5 (1976): 151+.Barbara Brookes, "The feminism of Condorcet and Sophie de Grouchy." Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century 189 (1980): 314+ Following de Condorcet's repeated, yet failed, appeals to the National Assembly in 1789 and 1790, Olympe de Gouges (in association with the Society of the Friends of Truth) authored and published the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen in 1791, another plea for the French Revolutionary government to recognize the natural and political rights of women."LES DROITS DE LA FEMME - Olympe de Gouges". www.olympedegouges.eu. Retrieved 2015-11-30. De Gouges wrote the Declaration in the prose of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, almost mimicking the failure of men to include more than a half of the French population in egalité. While the Declaration did not immediately accomplish its goals, it set a precedent for a manner in which later feminists could satirize their governments for their failures in equality, seen in documents such as A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and A Declaration of Sentiments.Carla Hesse, The Other Enlightenment: How French Women Became Modern(2001), 42.   Perhaps the most cited feminist writer of the time was Mary Wollstonecraft, often characterized as the first feminist philosopher. A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) is one of the first works that can unambiguously be called feminist, although by modern standards her comparison of women to the nobility, the elite of society (coddled, fragile, and in danger of intellectual and moral sloth) may at first seem dated as a feminist argument. Wollstonecraft identified the education and upbringing of women as creating their limited expectations based on a self-image dictated by the typically male perspective.Alexander, Meena. Women in Romanticism: Mary Wollstonecraft, Dorothy Wordsworth, and Mary Shelley. NY: Rowman and Littlefield (1989), 40 Despite her perceived inconsistencies (Miriam Brody referred to the "Two Wollstonecrafts") reflective of problems that had no easy answers, this book remains a foundation stone of feminist thought. Wollstonecraft believed that both genders contributed to inequality. She took women's considerable power over men for granted, and determined that both would require education to ensure the necessary changes in social attitudes. Given her humble origins and scant education, her personal achievements speak to her own determination. Wollstonecraft attracted the mockery of Samuel Johnson, who described her and her ilk as "Amazons of the pen". Based on his relationship with Hester Thrale,Prose, Francine. The Lives of the Muses. New York: Harper Collins, 2002, pp. 29-56. he complained of women's encroachment onto a male territory of writing, and not their intelligence or education. For many commentators, Wollstonecraft represents the first codification of equality feminism, or a refusal of the feminine role in society.Mandell, Laura. "The first woman (psycho)analysts; or, the friends of feminist history". Modern Language Quarterly 2004 March 65(1): 69-92.For the centrality of "equality" and "difference" feminism and their mutual metamorphosis, see Schiebinger, Londa: Has feminism changed science? Harvard: 1999, 1-18 19th-century feminists reacted to cultural inequities including the pernicious, widespread acceptance of the Victorian image of women's "proper" role and "sphere."  The Victorian ideal created a dichotomy of "separate spheres" for men and women that was very clearly defined in theory, though not always in reality. In this ideology, men were to occupy the public sphere (the space of wage labor and politics) and women the private sphere (the space of home and children). This "feminine ideal," also called "The Cult of Domesticity," was typified in Victorian conduct books such as Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management and Sarah Stickney Ellis's books. The Angel in the House (1854) and El ångel del hogar, bestsellers by Coventry Patmore and Maria del Pilar Sinués de Marco, came to symbolize the Victorian feminine ideal. Queen Victoria herself disparaged the concept of feminism, which she described in private letters as the "mad, wicked folly of 'Woman's Rights'''".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866–1928 |last=Crawford |first=Elizabeth |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 9781135434021 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2EK9P7-ZMsC&printsec=frontcover }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Toward the Light of Liberty |last=Grayling |first=A.

[[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] (1848) and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]] (1849) in London began to offer some education to women from 1848. By 1862, Davies established a committee to persuade the universities to allow women to sit for the recently established Local Examinations,{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what is this?}} and achieved partial success in 1865. She published ''The Higher Education of Women'' a year later. Davies and Leigh Smith founded the first higher educational institution for women and enrolled five students. The school later became [[Girton College, Cambridge]] in 1869, [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] in 1871, and [[Lady Margaret Hall]] at Oxford in 1879. Bedford began to award degrees the previous year.

The term "first-wave" was coined retrospectively when the term ''[[second-wave feminism]]'' was used to describe a newer feminist movement that fought social and cultural inequalities beyond basic political inequalities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  In the United States, feminist movement leaders campaigned for the national [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] and [[The Temperance movement in the United States|Temperance]] before championing women's rights. American first-wave feminism involved a wide range of women, some belonging to conservative Christian groups (such as [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]), others resembling the diversity and radicalism of much of [[second-wave feminism]] (such as Stanton, Anthony, [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], and the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]], of which Stanton was president). First-wave feminism in the United States is considered to have ended with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1920), which granted white women the right to vote in the United States.  Activism for the equality of women was not limited to the United States.  In mid-nineteenth century Persia, Tahirih[[Táhirih]] was active as a poet and religious reformer, and is recorded as proclaiming the equality of women at her execution.  She inspired later generations of Iranian feminists.<ref>Táhirih mentioned on PBS NewsHour - Mention of Táhirih as founder of Persian feminism by renowned scholar Azar Nafizi in a discussion on PBS about Shirin Ebadi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.</ref>  Louise Dittmar campaigned for women's rights, in Germany, in the 1840s.<ref>Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions, Louise Dittmar http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/dh/ditt.htm</ref>  Although slightly later in time, [[Fusae Ichikawa]], was in the first wave of women's activists in her own country of Japan, campaigning for women's suffrage. [[Mary Lee (suffragette)|Mary Lee]] was active in the suffrage movement in South Australia, the first Australian colony to grant women the vote in 1894. In New Zealand, [[Kate Sheppard]] and [[Mary Ann Müller]] worked to achieve the vote for women by 1893.  [[File:19th Amendment Pg1of1 AC.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Nineteenth Amendment]] In the United States, the antislavery campaign of the 1830s served as both a cause ideologically compatible with feminism and a blueprint for later feminist political organizing.

Access to [[abortion]] was also widely demanded for these reasons, but was more difficult to secure due to existing, deep societal divisions over the issue.  Third-wave feminists also fought to hasten social acceptance of female sexual freedom. As societal norms allowed men to have multiple sexual partners without rebuke, feminists sought sexual equality for that freedom and encouraged "[[sexual liberation]]" for women, including sex for pleasure with multiple partners, if desired.   ==== Global feminism ==== Following World War II, the [[United Nations]] (UN) extended feminism's global reach.

Niboyet was a Protestant who had adopted [[Saint-Simonianism]], and ''La Voix'' attracted other women from that movement, including the seamstress [[Jeanne Deroin]] and the primary schoolteacher [[Pauline Roland]]. Unsuccessful attempts were also made to recruit [[George Sand]].
