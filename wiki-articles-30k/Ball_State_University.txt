   Ball State University, commonly referred to as Ball State or BSU, is a public coeducational research university in Muncie, Indiana, United States, with two satellite facilities in Fishers and Indianapolis. On July 25, 1917, the Ball brothers, industrialists and founders of the Ball Corporation, acquired the foreclosed Indiana Normal Institute for $35,100 and gave the school and surrounding land to Indiana. The Indiana General Assembly accepted it in the spring of 1918, with an initial 235 students enrolling at the Indiana State Normal School – Eastern Division on June 17, 1918. Ball State is classified by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education as a high research activity university and a member of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. The university is composed of seven academic colleges, including the College of Architecture and Planning, the College of Communication, Information, and Media, the Miller College of Business, and Teachers College. Other institutions include Burris Laboratory School, the Indiana Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Humanities, and the Center for Business and Economic Research. Total 2013 enrollment consists of 21,053 students, 16,652 undergraduate students and 4,401 graduate students. Ball State University students hail from 48 states, two U.S. territories, 43 countries, and every one of Indiana's 92 counties. The university offers about 180 undergraduate majors and 130 minor areas of study, 175 bachelor's, 103 master's, and 17 doctoral degrees. There are 381 active student organizations and clubs on campus, including 34 fraternities and sororities. Ball State athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are known as the Ball State Cardinals. The university is a member of the Mid-American Conference and the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. {{Expand section|1= * Additional citations |date=April 2014}} {{main|History of Ball State University}} The location of today's Ball State University had its start in 1876 as a [[private university]] called the Eastern Indiana Normal School. The entire school, including classrooms, library, and president's residence were housed in what is today's Frank A. Bracken Administration Building. The one-building school had a peak enrollment of 256 and charged $10 for a year's tuition. It operated until the spring of 1901, when it was closed by its president, F.A.Z. Kumler, due to lack of funding. A year later, in the autumn of 1902, the school reopened as Palmer University for the next three years when Francis Palmer, a retired Indiana banker, gave the school a $100,000 [[Financial endowment|endowment]].  Between 1905 and 1917, the school dropped the Palmer name and operated as the Indiana Normal College. It had two divisions, the Normal School for educating teachers and the College of Applied Sciences. The school had an average enrollment of about 200 students. Due to diminishing enrollment and lack of funding, school president Francis Ingler closed Indiana Normal College at the end of the 1906–1907 school year. Between 1907 and 1912, the campus sat unused. In 1912, a group of local investors led by Michael Kelly reopened the school as the Indiana Normal Institute. To pay for updated materials and refurbishing the once-abandoned Administration Building, the school operated under a mortgage from the Muncie Trust Company. Although the school had its largest student body with a peak enrollment of 806, officials could not maintain mortgage payments, and the school was forced to close once again in June 1917 when the Muncie Trust Company initiated [[foreclosure]] proceedings. [[Image:Ball Brothers 1.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Ball brothers]] from left to right: George, Lucius, Frank, Edmund, and William.]] On July 25, 1917, the [[Ball brothers]], local industrialists and founders of the [[Ball Corporation]], bought the Indiana Normal Institute from foreclosure. The Ball Brothers also founded [[Ball Memorial Hospital]] and [[Minnetrista]], and were the benefactors of [[Keuka College]], founded by their uncle, George Harvey Ball.<ref>Anthony O. Edmonds and E. Bruce Geelhoed, ''Ball State University: An Interpretive History'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2001), p.51.</ref> For $35,100, the Ball brothers bought the Administration Building and surrounding land. In early 1918, during the [[Indiana General Assembly]]'s short session, state legislators accepted the gift of the school and land by the Ball Brothers. The state granted operating control of the Muncie campus and school buildings to the administrators of the [[Indiana State University|Indiana State Normal School]] in [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]]. That same year, the [[Marion, Indiana|Marion]] Normal Institute relocated to Muncie, adding its resources to what would officially be named the Indiana State Normal School – Eastern Division. An initial 235 students enrolled on June 17, 1918, with [[William W. Parsons]] assuming the role as first president of the university.  The close relationship between the Balls and the school led to an unofficial moniker for the college, with many students, faculty, and local politicians casually referring to the school as "Ball State," a shorthand alternative to its longer, official name. During the 1922 short session of the Indiana legislature, the state renamed the school as Ball Teachers College. This was in recognition to the Ball family's continuing beneficence to the institution. During this act, the state also reorganized its relationship with Terre Haute and established a separate local board of trustees for the Muncie campus. In 1924, Ball Teachers College's trustees hired [[Benjamin J. Burris]] as the successor to President [[Linnaeus N. Hines]]. The Ball brothers continued giving to the university and partially funded the construction of the Science Hall (now called Burkhardt Building) in 1924 and an addition to Ball Gymnasium in 1925. By the 1925–1926 school year, Ball State enrollment reached 991 students: 697 women and 294 men. Based on the school's close relationship with the Ball Corporation, a long-running nickname for the school was "Fruit Jar Tech."<ref>[http://www.bsu.edu/alumni/january2005/perspective/ ''Perspective'' (Ball State University alumni magazine)], January 2005. Retrieved September 9, 2007.</ref>  During the regular legislative session of 1929, the General Assembly informally separated the Terre Haute and Muncie campuses of the state teachers college system, but it placed the governing of the Ball State campus under the Indiana State Teachers College Board of Trustees based in Terre Haute.<ref name=isu>{{cite web | title=Indiana State University History and Traditions | publisher=Indiana State University | url=http://www.indstate.edu/isu_today/history_trad.htm#Eastern_Division }}</ref> With this action, the school was renamed Ball State Teachers College. The following year, enrollment increased to 1,118, with 747 female and 371 male students. [[Image:Beneficence072711a.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Daniel Chester French's ''Beneficence''.]] In 1935, the school added the Fine Arts Building for art, music, and dance instruction. Enrollment that year reached 1,151: 723 women and 428 men. As an expression of the many gifts from the Ball family since 1917, sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]] was commissioned by Muncie's [[chamber of commerce]] to cast a bronze fountain figure to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Ball brothers' gift to the state. His creation, the statue ''[[Beneficence (statue)|Beneficence]],'' still stands today between the Administration Building and Lucina Hall where Talley Avenue ends at University Avenue.  In 1961, Ball State became fully independent of Indiana State University through the creation of the Ball State College Board of Trustees.<ref name="isu"/> The official name of the school was also changed to Ball State College. The Indiana General Assembly approved the development of a state-assisted architecture program, establishing the [[Ball State University College of Architecture and Planning|College of Architecture and Planning]], which opened on March 23, 1965. The Center for Radio and Television (now named the [[Ball State University College of Communication, Information, and Media|College of Communication, Information, and Media]]) opened the following year, in 1966.  Recognizing the college's expanding academic curriculum and growing enrollment (10,066 students), the General Assembly approved renaming the school to Ball State University in 1965. Most of the university's largest residence halls were completed during this period of high growth, including DeHority Complex (1960), Noyer Complex (1962), Studebaker Complex (1965), [[LaFollette Complex]] (1967), and Johnson Complex (1969). Academic and athletic buildings, including [[Irving Gymnasium]] (1962), [[Emens Auditorium, Ball State University|Emens Auditorium]] (1964), Cooper Science Complex (1967), [[Scheumann Stadium]] (1967), Carmichael Hall (1969), Teachers College Building (1969), Pruis Hall (1972), and [[Bracken Library]] (1974), also expanded the university's capacity and educational opportunities. [[Image:DavidLettermanAtBSU.JPG|thumb|250px|David Letterman Communication and Media Building dedication ceremony.]] The university experienced another building boom beginning in the 2000s, with the openings of the Art and Journalism Building (2001), [[Shafer Tower]] (2001), the Music Instruction Building (2004), the David Letterman Communication and Media Building (2007), Park Hall (2007), Kinghorn Hall (2010), Marilyn K.

Several modern campus buildings (early-1960s to early-1980s) have been built in [[Brutalist architecture]], embracing blank walls and exposed concrete. Examples of this style include the [[Ball State University College of Architecture and Planning|Architecture Building]], [[Bracken Library]], and [[Miller College of Business|Whitinger Business Building]]. The [[Ball State University Teachers College|Teachers College Building]], built in 1968, is the tallest building on campus, at 10 floors and {{convert|138|ft|m|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Teachers College|publisher=Emporis |url=http://www.emporis.com/building/teacherscollege-muncie-in-usa}}</ref>  Recent building additions and expansions (early-1990s to present) have shied away from Brutalist designs, and instead, have been built to respect the scale and style of the university's older Collegiate Gothic buildings. While red and brown brick accented by limestone have remained the favored façade materials, large windows have become more commonplace in buildings constructed since the late-1990s to emphasize natural lighting. Examples of this architecture include the Alumni Center, Art and Journalism Building, Music Instruction Building, and the David Letterman Communication and Media Building.  ===Sustainability=== [[Image:Parkhall 300.jpg|left|thumb|Park Hall (shown under construction in 2007) was one of the first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified buildings on campus.]]  Ball State has adopted [[environmental sustainability]] as a primary component to the university's strategic plan and vision.<ref name="sustainability"/> Starting in the mid-2000s, all building additions and renovations are designed to meet [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certification standards.

[[Bill Scholl]] was named Director of Intercollegiate Athletics in April 2012 after 23 years in the [[Notre Dame University]] athletic department.  [[Ball State Cardinals football]] was established in the 1924 season and has a 431–384–32 record as of February 2014. Ball State has won 10 conference championships in football, most recently in 1996, and has appeared in six NCAA Division I postseason bowl games, most recently in [[2013 Ball State Cardinals football team|2014]] playing [[Arkansas State University]] in the [[GoDaddy Bowl]]; the Cardinals have an 0–7 record for bowl game appearances. Ball State annually competes against conference rival [[Northern Illinois Huskies football|Northern Illinois]], playing for the [[Bronze Stalk Trophy]]; Ball State holds a 1–5 record in the contest. [[Mike Neu]] is the current head coach, a position he has held since 2016.  [[Ball State Cardinals men's basketball]] began in 1920. Although there was little success in the program from its start until the 1970s, the next two decades would be the highlight of the program's performance. Ball State became a powerhouse in the Mid-American Conference, winning a record seven MAC tournaments and with subsequent appearances in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] between 1981 and 2000. The Cardinals' most successful year was 1990, when the team reached the Sweet Sixteen but lost to eventual national champion [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]], 69-67. Even though the Cardinals lost the game, BSU player Chandler Thompson recorded what is considered to be one of the most memorable put-back dunks in College Basketball History. The team's last NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament appearance was in [[2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2000]]. [[James Whitford]] became head coach in 2013.  [[Charlie Cardinal]] is Ball State's [[mascot]], modeled after Indiana's state bird, the [[northern cardinal]].  ==Traditions== {{multiple image | align     = right | direction = horizontal | width     = 150 | image1    = Frog Baby Fountain, Ball State University, May 2013.jpg | width1    =  | alt1      =  | caption1  = | image2    = Frog Baby Statue, Ball State University, winter 2013-2014.jpg | width2    =  | alt2      =  | caption2  =  | header            =  | header_align      =  | header_background =  | footer            = ''Frog Baby'' unadorned (left) and dressed in anticipation of winter weather in 2013 (right). | footer_align      =  | footer_background =  | background color  =  }}  ===''Frog Baby''=== The ''[[Frog Baby Fountain (Ball State University)|Frog Baby]]'' statue has been the center of legend and tradition since it was presented by [[Ball Brothers|Frank Ball]] in 1937.
