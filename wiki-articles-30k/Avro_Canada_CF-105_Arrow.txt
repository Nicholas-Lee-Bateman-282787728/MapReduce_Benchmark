 The Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow was a delta-winged interceptor aircraft designed and built by Avro Canada. The Arrow is considered to have been an advanced technical and aerodynamic achievement for the Canadian aviation industry. The CF-105 (Mark 2) held the promise of near-Mach 2 speeds at altitudes of  and was intended to serve as the Royal Canadian Air Force's (RCAF) primary interceptor in the 1960s and beyond.Page et al. 2004, p.&nbsp;159. The Arrow was the culmination of a series of design studies begun in 1953 examining improved versions of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. Intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase, the first Arrow Mk. I, RL-201, was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I. Flight testing began with RL-201 on 25 March 1958, and the design quickly demonstrated excellent handling and overall performance, reaching Mach 1.98. Powered by the Pratt & Whitney J75, another three Mk. Is were completed, RL-202 through -204.  The lighter and more powerful Orenda Iroquois engine was soon ready for testing, and the first Mk.II with the Iroquois, RL-206, was ready for taxi testing in preparation for flight and acceptance tests by RCAF pilots by early 1959. On 20 February 1959, the development of the Arrow (and its Iroquois engines) was abruptly halted before the project review had taken place.Dow 1979, p.&nbsp;127; "Orenda History." Magellan Aerospace Corporation, 2005. Retrieved: 12 March 2009. Two months later, the assembly line, tooling, plans and existing airframes and engines were ordered to be destroyed. The cancellation was the topic of considerable political controversy at the time,  and the subsequent destruction of the aircraft in production remains a topic for debate among historians and industry pundits. "This action effectively put Avro out of business and its highly skilled engineering and production personnel scattered...."Payne 2006, p.&nbsp;213. In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began developing a capable fleet of long-range bombers with the ability to deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe.Dow 1979, p.&nbsp;67. The main threat was principally from high-speed, high-altitude bombing runs launched from the Soviet Union travelling over the Arctic against military bases and built-up and industrial centres in Canada and the United States.Dow 1979, p.&nbsp;60. To counter this threat, Western countries strenuously undertook the development of interceptors that could engage and destroy these bombers before they reached their targets.Gunston 1981, p.&nbsp;18.Dow 1979, pp.&nbsp;84–85. A.&nbsp;V. Roe Canada Limited had been set up as a subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1945, initially handling repair and maintenance work for aircraft at Malton, Ontario Airport, today known as Toronto Pearson International Airport. The next year the company began the design of Canada's first jet fighter for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Avro CF-100 Canuck all-weather interceptor.Dow 1979, pp.&nbsp;61–62. The Canuck underwent a lengthy and troubled prototype stage before entering service seven years later in 1953.Dow 1979, p.&nbsp;70. Nevertheless, it went on to become one of the most enduring aircraft of its class, serving in a variety of roles until 1981.Lombardi, Mike and Larry Merritt. "Toronto's Long History of Aerospace Achievement." Boeing Frontiers Magazine (online), Volume 4, Issue 2, June 2005. Retrieved: 26 September 2010. Recognizing that the delays that affected the development and deployment of the CF-100 could also affect its successor, and the fact that the Soviets were working on newer jet-powered bombers that would render the CF-100 ineffective, the RCAF began looking for a supersonic, missile-armed replacement for the Canuck even before it had entered service.Dow 1979, p.&nbsp;83. In March 1952, the RCAF's Final Report of the All-Weather Interceptor Requirements Team was submitted to Avro Canada. Avro engineering had been considering supersonic issues already at this point. Supersonic flight works in a very different fashion and presents a number of new problems.  One of the most critical, and surprising, was the sudden onset of a new form of drag, known as wave drag. The effects of wave drag were so strong, that engines of the era could not provide enough power to overcome it, leading to the concept of a "sound barrier".Anderson 2008. pp.&nbsp;683, 695. German research during the Second World War had shown the onset of wave drag was greatly reduced by using airfoils that varied in curvature as gradually as possible. This suggested the use of thinner airfoils with much longer chord than designers would have used on subsonic aircraft. These designs were impractical because they left little internal room in the wing for armament or fuel. However, they also discovered it was possible to "trick" the airflow into the same behaviour if a conventional thicker airfoil was used, swept rearward at a sharp angle, creating a swept-wing. This provided many of the advantages of a thinner airfoil while also retaining the internal space needed for strength and fuel storage. Another advantage was that the wings were clear of the supersonic shock wave generated by the nose of the aircraft.Whitcomb 2002, pp.&nbsp;89–90. Almost every fighter project in the postwar era immediately applied the concept, which started appearing on production fighters in the late 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded.Milberry 1984, p.&nbsp;317. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned. Another solution to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had many of the same advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions.Stimson, Thomas E. Jr. "Era of the Flying Triangles." Popular Mechanics, 106 (3). September 1956, pp.&nbsp;89–94. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages. Further proposals based on the delta wing resulted in two versions of the design known as C104: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2.Dow 1979, p.&nbsp;84. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, at the time a cutting-edge feature in a fighter,Campagna 1998, pp.&nbsp;68–69. and gave it twin-engine reliability. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.Page et al. 2004, p.&nbsp;11. Intensive discussions between Avro and the RCAF examined a wide range of alternative sizes and configurations for a supersonic interceptor, culminating in RCAF "Specification AIR 7-3" in April 1953.  AIR 7-3 called specifically for crew of two, twin engines, with a range of ) for a normal low-speed mission, and  for a high-speed interception mission.  It also specified operation from a  runway; a Mach 1.5 cruising speed at an altitude of ; and manoeuvrability for 2&nbsp;g turns with no loss of speed or altitude at Mach 1.5 and .  The specification required five minutes from starting the aircraft's engines to reaching  altitude and Mach 1.5.  It was also to have turn-around time on the ground of less than .Dow 1979, p.&nbsp;89.  An RCAF team led by Ray Foottit visited U.S. aircraft producers and surveyed British and French manufacturers before concluding that no existing or planned aircraft could fulfill these requirements.Dow 1979, p.&nbsp;25. Avro submitted their modified C105 design in May 1953, essentially a two-man version of the C104/2. A change to a "shoulder-mounted" wing allowed rapid access to the aircraft's internals, weapons bay, and engines. The new design also allowed the wing to be built as a single structure sitting on the upper fuselage, simplifying construction and improving strength. The wing design required a long main landing gear that still had to fit within the thin delta wing, presenting an engineering challenge. Five different wing sizes were outlined in the report, ranging between ; the  sized version was eventually selected.Peden 2003, p.&nbsp;26.  The engines considered for the aircraft were the  Bristol Olympus OL-3, the Curtiss-Wright J-67 (a US-built version of the Olympus), or the Orenda TR.9 engines.Dow 1979, p.&nbsp;85. Armament was stored in a large internal bay located in a "belly" position, taking up over one third of the aircraft fuselage. A wide variety of weapons could be deployed from this bay, such as the Hughes Falcon guided missile, the CARDE Velvet Glove air-to-air missile, or four general-purpose 1,000&nbsp;lb bombs.Dow 1979, p.&nbsp;86. The Velvet Glove radar-guided missile had been under development with the RCAF for some time, but was believed unsuitable for supersonic speeds and lacked development potential. Consequently, further work on that project was cancelled in 1956.Campagna 1998, pp.&nbsp;66–67. In July 1953, the proposal was accepted and Avro was given the go-ahead to start a full design study under the project name: "CF-105".Page et al. 2004, p.&nbsp;12. In December, CA$27 million was provided to start flight modelling. At first, the project was limited in scope, but the introduction of the Soviet Myasishchev M-4 Bison jet bomber and the Soviet Union's testing of a hydrogen bomb dramatically changed Cold War priorities.Peden 2003, p.&nbsp;45. In March 1955, the contract was upgraded to CA$260 million for five Arrow Mk.1 flight-test aircraft, to be followed by 35 Arrow Mk. 2s with production engines and fire-control systems.Shaw 1979, p.&nbsp;58. In order to meet the timetable set by the RCAF, Avro decided that Arrow program would adopt the Cook-Craigie plan; effectively eliminating the prototype phase, the first test airframes were constructed on production jigs.Whitcomb 2002, p.&nbsp;86.Pigott 1997, p.&nbsp;55. Any changes would be incorporated into the jigs while testing continued, with full production starting when the test program was complete. As Jim Floyd noted at the time, this was a risky approach, however: "...it was decided to take the technical risks involved to save time on the programme... I will not pretend that this philosophy of production type build from the outset did not cause us a lot of problems in Engineering. However, it did achieve its objective." In order to mitigate risks, a massive testing program was started. By mid-1954, the first production drawings were issued and wind tunnel work began, along with extensive computer simulation studies carried out both in Canada and the United States using sophisticated computer programs.Peden 2003, p.&nbsp;38. In a related program, nine instrumented free-flight models were mounted on solid fuel Nike rocket boosters and launched from Point Petre over Lake Ontario while two additional models were launched from the NACA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, over the Atlantic Ocean. These models were for aerodynamic drag and stability testing, flown to a maximum speed of Mach 1.7+ before intentionally crashing into the water.Page et al. 2004, p.&nbsp;15.Belleau, Naomi. "Domestic Operations: Trinity's "Fiona" takes the plunge in search of Avro Arrow." Canadian Navy. Retrieved: 11 September 2010. Experiments showed the need for only a small number of design changes, mainly involving the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced to control spanwise flow,Whitcomb 2002, pp.&nbsp;89–91. and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up.Campagna 1998, p.&nbsp;37. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy. The aircraft used a measure of magnesium and titanium in the fuselage, the latter limited largely to the area around the engines and to fasteners. Titanium was still expensive and not widely used because it was difficult to machine. The construction of the airframe itself was fairly conventional, however, with a semi-monocoque frame and multi-spar wing.Whitcomb 2002, pp.&nbsp;109–110. The Arrow's thin wing required aviation's first  hydraulic system to supply enough force to the control surfaces, while using small actuators and piping. A rudimentary fly-by-wire system was employed, in which the pilot's input was detected by a series of pressure-sensitive transducers in the stick, and their signal was sent to an electronic control servo that operated the valves in the hydraulic system to move the various flight controls. This resulted in a lack of control feel; because the control stick input was not mechanically connected to the hydraulic system, the variations in back-pressure from the flight control surfaces that would normally be felt by the pilot could no longer be transmitted back into the stick. To re-create a sense of feel, the same electronic control box rapidly responded to the hydraulic back-pressure fluctuations and triggered actuators in the stick, making it move slightly; this system, called "artificial feel", was also a first.Campagna 1998, pp.&nbsp;73–74. In 1954, the RB.106 program was cancelled, necessitating the use of the backup Wright J67 engine instead. In 1955, this engine was also cancelled, leaving the design with no engine. At this point, the Pratt & Whitney J75 was selected for the initial test-flight models, while the new TR 13 engine was developed at Orenda for the production Mk 2s.Pigott 1997, p.&nbsp;56. After evaluating the engineering mock-ups and the full-scale wooden mock-up in February 1956, the RCAF demanded additional changes, selecting the advanced RCA-Victor Astra fire-control system firing the equally advanced United States Navy Sparrow II in place of the MX-1179 and Falcon combination. Avro vocally objected on the grounds that neither of these were even in testing at that point, whereas both the MX-1179 and Falcon were almost ready for production and would have been nearly as effective for "a very large saving in cost".Peden 2003, pp.&nbsp;46–47.  The Astra proved to be problematic as the system ran into a lengthy period of delays, and when the USN cancelled the Sparrow II in 1956, Canadair was quickly brought in to continue the Sparrow program in Canada, although they expressed grave concerns about the project as well and the move added yet more expense.Campagna 1998, p.&nbsp;68.   Go-ahead on the production was given in 1955. The rollout of the first CF-105, marked as RL-201, took place on 4 October 1957. The company had planned to capitalize on the event, inviting more than  guests to the occasion.Gainor 2001, p.&nbsp;15. Unfortunately for Avro, the media and public attention for the Arrow rollout was dwarfed by the launch of Sputnik the same day."The Arrow Unveiled." Flight International, 11 October 1957. pp. 562-563. The J-75 engine was slightly heavier than the PS-13, and therefore required ballast to be placed in the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.Page et al. 2004, p.&nbsp;161. RL-201 first flew on 25 March 1958 with Chief Development Test Pilot S/L Janusz Żurakowski at the controls.Pigott 1997, p.&nbsp;57. Four more J75-powered Mk 1s were delivered in the next 18 months. The test flights, limited to "proof-of-concept" and assessing flight characteristics, revealed no serious design faults.Campagna 1998, p.&nbsp;84."Air & space Smithsonian, Volume 13." Smithsonian Institution. 1998, p.&nbsp;37. The CF-105 demonstrated excellent handling throughout the flight envelope, a large part due to the natural qualities of the delta-wing, but responsibility can also be attributed to the Arrow's Stability Augmentation System. The aircraft went supersonic on its third flight and, on the seventh, broke  at  while climbing. A top speed of Mach 1.98 was achieved, and this was not at the limits of its performance. However, an Avro report made public in 2015 clarifies that during the highest speed flight, the Arrow reached Mach 1.90 in steady level flight, and an indicated Mach number of 1.95 was recorded in a dive. Waechter 2015, pp. 113-18. Estimates up to Mach 1.98 likely originated from an attempt to compensate for lag error, which was expected in diving flight. Waechter 2015, p. 73. Although no major problems were encountered during the initial testing phase, some minor issues with the landing gear and flight control system had to be rectified. The former problem was partly due to the tandem main landing gear being very narrow, in order to fit into the wings; the leg shortened in length and rotated as it was stowed.Campagna 1998, p.&nbsp;70. During one landing incident, the chain mechanism (used to shorten the gear) in the Mark 1 gear jammed, resulting in incomplete rotation.  In a second incident with Arrow 202 on 11 November 1958, the flight control system commanded elevons full down at landing; the resulting reduction in weight on the gears reduced the effective tire friction, ultimately resulting in brake lockup and subsequent gear collapse.Campagna 1998, p.&nbsp;86. A photograph taken of the incident proved that inadvertent flight control activation had caused the accident."Avro Museum." Avro Museum of Canada via web.archive.org. Retrieved: 4 September 2010. The only occasion when a test flight was diverted occurred on 2 February 1959, when a TCA Viscount crash-landed in Toronto, necessitating a landing at CFB Trenton.Page et al. 2004, p.&nbsp;115. The stability augmentation system also required much fine-tuning.Campagna 1998, p.&nbsp;87.  Although the CF-105 was not the first aircraft to use such a system, it was one of the first of its kind, and was problematic. By February 1959, the five aircraft had completed the majority of the company test program and were progressing to the RCAF acceptance trials.Page et al. 2004, p.&nbsp;117. From 1953, some senior Canadian military officials at the Chief of Staffs began to question the program.Story, Donald C. and Russel Isinger. "The origins of the cancellation of Canada's Avro CF-105 arrow fighter program: A failure of strategy". Journal of Strategic Studies, 30(6), December 2007. The Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy were both strongly opposed to the Arrow, since "substantial funds were being diverted to the Air Force", while Air Marshal Hugh Campbell, RCAF Chief of Staff, backed it right up to cancellation.Stewart 1988, p.&nbsp;235. In June 1957, when the governing Liberals lost the federal election and a Progressive Conservative government under John Diefenbaker took power, the aircraft's prospects began to noticeably change. Diefenbaker had campaigned on a platform of reining in what the Conservatives claimed was "rampant Liberal spending". Nonetheless, by 1958, the parent company had become Canada's third largest business enterprise and had primary interests in rolling stock, steel and coal, electronics and aviation with 39 different companies under the A.&nbsp;V. Roe Canada banner.Stewart, 1988, p.&nbsp;238. In August 1957, the Diefenbaker government signed the NORAD (North American Air Defense)"NORAD at 40 Historical Overview." fas.org. Retrieved: 4 September 2010. Agreement with the United States, making Canada a partner with American command and control. The USAF was in the process of completely automating their air defence system with the SAGE project, and offered Canada the opportunity to share this sensitive information for the air defence of North America."Good Neighbours Make Good Fences: Canadian Continental Defence Planning and the 1954 Decision to fund the Mid-Canada Early Warning Line." Conference of Defence Associates Institute, April 2009. One aspect of the SAGE system was the Bomarc nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft missile. This led to studies on basing Bomarcs in Canada in order to push the line further north, even though the deployment was found to be extremely costly. The missile alone was expected to cost C$164 million, while SAGE would absorb another C$107 million, not counting the cost of improvements to radar; in all, it was projected to raise Canada's defence spending "as much as 25 to 30%", according to George Pearkes, then Minister of National Defence.Campagna 1998 Defence against ballistic missiles was also becoming a priority. The existence of Sputnik had also raised the spectre of attack from space, and, as the year progressed, word of a "missile gap" began spreading. An American brief of the meeting with Pearkes records his concern Canada could not afford defensive systems against both ballistic missiles and manned bombers."Canada-U.S. Defence Problems, File: DDE Trip to Canada, Memcons, 8–11 July 1958." Eisenhower Library. It is also said Canada could afford the Arrow or Bomarc/SAGE, but not both.Campagna 1998, p.&nbsp;88. By 11 August 1958, Pearkes requested cancellation of the Arrow, but the Cabinet Defence Committee (CDC) refused. Pearkes tabled it again in September, and recommended installation of the Bomarc missile system. The latter was accepted but, again, the CDC refused to cancel the entire Arrow program. The CDC wanted to wait until a major review on 31 March 1959. They cancelled the Sparrow/Astra system in September 1958.Campagna 1998, p.&nbsp;108. Efforts to continue the program through cost-sharing with other countries were then explored. In 1959, Pearkes would say the ballistic missile was the greater threat, and Canada purchased Bomarc "in lieu of more airplanes"."File 79/469 Folder 19." Directorate of History, Department of National Defence Canada tried to sell the Arrow to the U.S. and Britain, but had no takers. The aircraft industry in both countries was considered a national interest and the purchase of foreign designs was rare;Peden 1987, p.&nbsp;72. in this era, the Arrow was far from the only heavy high-speed interceptor project to end in cancellation. From 1955 onwards, the UK had shown considerable interest in the Arrow; in April 1956, the UK's Air Council recommended a purchase of 144 Arrows for the RAF to serve alongside the Saunders-Roe SR.177 mixed power interceptor, instead of the "thin-wing" Gloster Javelin then under study. Projected power plants for the RAF Arrow were the Bristol Olympus 7R -  thrust dry,  with reheat, the Rolls-Royce Conway Stage 4 -  thrust dry, with reheat, and the de Havilland Gyron -  thrust dry, with reheat. Procurement of the Arrow from Canada, and setting up a production line in the UK, was studied, the unit price per aircraft built in the UK being estimated at £220,000 each for a production run of 100 aircraft, as opposed to the estimate of £150,000 per aircraft for the "thin wing" Javelin.defe7-1409e06_06 The CF-105 would serve as a stopgap until the UK's F.155 project came to fruition; however with the F.155 due in 1963 and the Arrow not likely to reach the RAF before 1962, there was little point in proceeding.Whitcomb 2002, pp.&nbsp;84 and 215–216.

In January 1959, the UK's final answer was no; Britain countered with an offer to sell Canada the English Electric Lightning.Whitcomb 2002, p.&nbsp;220. Acting on media speculation that the Iroquois engine program was also in jeopardy of being cancelled, the French government, whose original intention had been to place a major order for 300 Iroquois engines for the Dassault Mirage IV bomber, chose to end negotiations in October 1958Campagna 1998, pp.&nbsp;110–111. and opted for an upgraded version of the indigenous SNECMA Atar, instead.Stewart 1998, pp.&nbsp;290–291. There was never an explanation for this decision offered by the French government, even after Avro tried to offer the Iroquois as a private venture. Two American advanced interceptor designs, the Republic XF-103 and North American XF-108, were under development for the United States Air Force as part of their "1954 Interceptor"; when both were cancelled in the early design and mock-up phases, it added weight to the justification of cancelling the Arrow.Whitcomb 2002, pp.&nbsp;80, 181–182.Campagna 1998, pp.&nbsp;109–110. In 1958, Avro Aircraft Limited President and General Manager Fred Smye elicited a promise from the USAF to "supply, free, the fire control system and missiles and if they would allow the free use of their flight test centre at... Edwards AFB."Smye 2014, p.&nbsp;87. The Arrow's cancellation was announced on 20 February 1959. The day became known as "Black Friday" in the Canadian aviation industry.Zuuring 1999, p.&nbsp;112. Prime Minister Diefenbaker claimed the decision was based on "a thorough examination" of threats and defensive measures, and the cost of defensive systems.Godefroy, Dr Andrew B. (Ed) "Projecting Power: Canada's Air Force 2035." Canadian Forces. 2009, p.&nbsp;68. ISBN 978-1-100-12396-7 The decision immediately put 14,528 Avro employees, as well as nearly 15,000 other employees in the Avro supply chain of outside suppliers, out of work.Stewart 1998, p.&nbsp;269; Peden 2003, p.&nbsp;157; Harrison, Mark. "Diefenbaker surrenders our sovereignty?" Toronto Daily Star, 23 February 1959, p.&nbsp;1. Declassified records show Avro management was caught unprepared by the suddenness of the announcement by the government; while executives were aware that the program was in jeopardy, they expected it to continue until the March review. It was widely believed during this lead-up to the review, the first Arrow Mk&nbsp;II, RL-206, would be prepared for an attempt at both world speed and altitude records.Peden 2003, p.&nbsp;78. An attempt was made to provide the completed Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high-speed test aircraft.Whitcomb 2002, p.&nbsp;202. The NRC refused, noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance, as well as qualified pilots, the NRC could make no use of them. A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro Vice-President (Engineering) Jim Floyd's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation. This proposal, like others from the United States, was never realized.Shaw 1979, p.&nbsp;89. Within two months of the project cancellation, all aircraft, engines, production tooling and technical data were ordered scrapped.Campagna 1998, p.&nbsp;121. Officially, the reason given for the destruction order from Cabinet and the Chiefs of Staff was to destroy classified and "secret" materials used in the Arrow/Iroquois programs.Stewart 1998, pp.&nbsp;274–276. The action has been attributed to Royal Canadian Mounted Police fears that a Soviet "mole" had infiltrated Avro, later confirmed to some degree in the Mitrokhin archives.Andrew and Mitrokhin 2000, p.&nbsp;219. Rumours had circulated that Air Marshal W.&nbsp;A. Curtis, a First World War ace who headed Avro, had ignored Diefenbaker and spirited one of the Arrows away to be saved for posterity.  These rumours were given life in a 1968 interview, when Curtis was asked point-blank if the rumour was true. He replied, "I don't want to answer that."  He proceeded to question the wisdom of printing the story of a missing Arrow, and wondered whether it would be safe to reveal the existence of a surviving airframe only nine years later. "If it is in existence it may have to wait another 10 years.  Politically it may cause a lot of trouble."McNenly, Pat. "Avro Arrow." Toronto Star, 30 November 1968, p.&nbsp;1. The legend endures that one of the prototypes remains intact somewhere. Following the cancellation of the Avro Arrow project, CF-105 Chief Aerodynamicist Jim Chamberlin led a team of 25 engineers to NASA's Space Task Group to become lead engineers, program managers, and heads of engineering in NASA's manned space programs—Projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo. The Space Task Group team eventually grew to 32 Avro engineers and technicians, and became emblematic of what many Canadians viewed as a "brain drain" to the United States.French and Burgess 2007, p.&nbsp;196. Among the former Arrow team engineers to go south were Tecwyn Roberts (NASA's first Flight Dynamics Officer on Project Mercury and later Director of Networks at Goddard Space Flight Center) John Hodge (Flight Director and Manager on the cancelled Space Station Freedom project), Dennis Fielder (Director of Space Station Task Force, later the Space Station), Owen Maynard (Chief of the LM engineering office in the Apollo Program Office) and Rod Rose (Technical Assistant for the Space Shuttle program)."Tecwyn Roberts." llanddaniel.co.uk.

Many other engineers, including Jim Floyd, found work in either the UK or the United States. Work undertaken by both Avro Canada and Floyd benefited supersonic research at Hawker Siddeley, Avro Aircraft's UK parent, and contributed to programs such as the HSA.1000 supersonic transport design studies, influential in the design of the Concorde.Whitcomb 1999, pp.&nbsp;251–259."Pattern of the Industry." Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology. 1960, 32(1). In 1961, the RCAF obtained 66 McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo aircraft, one of the American designs the RCAF originally rejected,Page et al. 2004, p.&nbsp;13. to serve in the role originally intended for the Avro Arrow. The controversy surrounding this acquisition, and Canada's acquiring nuclear weapons for the Voodoos and Bomarcs eventually contributed to the collapse of the Diefenbaker government in 1963.Stursberg 1975, p.&nbsp;122. Although nearly everything connected to the CF-105 and Orenda Iroquois programs was destroyed, the cockpit and nose gear of RL-206, the first Mk&nbsp;2 Arrow, and two outer panels of RL-203's wings were saved and are on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, alongside an Iroquois engine."Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow 2." aviation.technomuses.ca. Retrieved: 24 September 2010. With specifications comparable to then-current offerings from American and Soviet design bureaus, at the time of its cancellation, the Arrow was considered by one aviation industry observer to be one of the most advanced aircraft in the world. The Arrow's cancellation eventually led to the end of Avro Aircraft Limited (Canada) and its President and General Manager, Crawford Gordon Jr. was fired shortly afterward. In 1962, the Hawker Siddeley Group formally dissolved A.&nbsp;V. Roe Canada and transferred all its assets to Hawker Siddeley's newly formed subsidiary, Hawker Siddeley Canada.Bothwell and Kilbourn 1979, p.&nbsp;266. The nosecone section of Avro Arrow RL-206, currently on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, was smuggled out of the Avro Aircraft plant in Malton by members of the RCAF Flying Personnel Medical Establishment, a detachment of RCAF Station Downsview on Avenue Road in Toronto, where it resided for many years and was employed in high-altitude work. The Commanding Officer of the Flying Personnel Medical Establishment, Wing Commander Roy Stubbs, provides this prologue to the former aircraft: One day after a change of government, the new RCAF Chief of the Air Staff came to inspect our facilities and programs and after lunch, I asked if he would like to see something special. I showed him a piece of the Arrow; cockpit section and engine nacelles and a few other bits. I asked him what we should do with it and he said to keep it hidden until the climate in Ottawa was right, and then he would arrange to have it placed in the National Aeronautical Museum in Ottawa. Eventually this was done and at least a bit of history was saved.The Western Canada Aviation Museum magazine The Arrow Mark 1 was the initial version powered by two Pratt&nbsp;& Whitney J75 turbojet engines that produced  of thrust each.  The Mk&nbsp;1 was used for development and flight testing.  Five were completed.Donald, David, ed. "Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow". The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft, p.&nbsp;88. New York: Barnes & Noble Books, 1997. ISBN 0-7607-0592-5. The Mk&nbsp;2 version was to be fitted with the Iroquois engine and would be evaluated by RCAF acceptance pilots as well as Avro test pilots. The Astra/Sparrow fire control system had been terminated by the government in September 1958 with all aircraft to employ the Hughes/Falcon combination. At the time of cancellation of the entire program, the first Arrow Mk 2, RL-206, was ready for taxi trials;Campagna 1998, p.&nbsp;85.  Avro expected it to break the world speed record, but it never flew. Top speed would have been limited by atmospheric frictional heating, but according to project engineer James Floyd, "[t]he aluminum alloy structure which we favoured was good for speeds greater than a Mach number of 2."Floyd 1958 Avro Canada had a wide range of advanced Arrow variants under development at the time of project cancellation. Frequent mention is made of an Arrow that could have been capable of Mach&nbsp;3, similar to the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25. This was not the production version, but one of the design studies, and would have been a greatly modified version of the Arrow Mk&nbsp;2, featuring revised engine inlets and extensive use of stainless steel or titanium to withstand airframe heating.Campagna 2003, p.&nbsp;175. In 2010, in the context of ongoing controversy surrounding the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Canadian procurement, as an alternative to continued support of the troubled F-35, a group of individuals began lobbying Ottawa to consider domestic production of an updated version of the Avro Arrow, using modern materials and engines but keeping the Arrow's proven "basic design".Harris, Kathleen. "Ottawa accused of axing Avro Arrow revival too soon." CBC News, 10 September 2012. Retrieved: 11 September 2012.  The group feels that a modernized Arrow would out-perform the F-35 in speed, range and maximum altitude, among others, while admitting that the Arrow lacks the F-35's stealth characteristics.Chase, Steve. "Will legendary Avro Arrow make Lazarus-like return?" The Globe and Mail, 9 September 2012. Retrieved: 11 September 2012. However in 2012, the Harper government publicly rejected the bid, saying the redesigned Arrow program was risky, would take too long to develop, and would be too expensive.Visser, Josh. "Harper government officially grounds Avro Arrow relaunch proposal." National Post, 11 September 2012. A replica Arrow built by Allan Jackson was used in The Arrow, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production. He began building a full-scale replica of the Arrow in 1989, and was approached by the producers of the Arrow miniseries in 1996, then about 70% complete, who made an offer to complete the construction if the replica could be used for the production. It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows. The replica was later donated to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While in a temporary outdoor collection, it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009. It has since been repaired, but is no longer on public display.Gainor, Chris. "Modern Arrows: Movie Replica." avroarrow.org. Retrieved: 11 September 2010 The Avro Museum is building a 2/3rds scale, manned, high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow (officially known as ARROW II) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations in order to become an airshow demonstration aircraft. Construction began in October 2007, and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and passed its first MDRA inspection, and now has a serial number. Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT-15D-4s, the ARROW II will have a top speed of approximately 500 knots and a range of 1,800 miles. Current projections show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and it is hoped that ground tests will start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow."Arrow II Project ."

The Canadian Air and Space Museum (CASM), located at the former CFB Downsview, features a full-size replica Arrow built by volunteers with assistance from local aerospace firms. With a metal structure, the replica features many authentic-looking components including landing gear constructed by Messier-Dowty, the original Arrow primary landing gear sub-contractor. Painted in the colours of Arrow 25203, the Arrow replica was rolled out for a media event on 28 September 2006 and was on public display on 8–9 October 2006 to commemorate the original aircraft's rollout in 1957."Our Collection and Displays."

This replica is now in storage (in the airport area) after being displayed at the Toronto International Centre (across the road from where the actual aircraft were built) for a technology trade show that ran from 30 September to 4 October 2013. The future plans for the replica as well as the other remaining aircraft in the now closed CASM is still up in the air. The museum is seeking a location near Pearson International Airport, so that it can display some time in 2015, all of its artifacts including a partly restored Avro Lancaster bomber."The Replica of the legendary Avro Arrow will be moved into a storage facility." Warbirds News, 23 September 2013.    In 1997, the  CBC broadcast their two-part miniseries, The Arrow. The production used a combination of archival film, remote-control flying models and computer animation for the static, ground and  flying sequences.
