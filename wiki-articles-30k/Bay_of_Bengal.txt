   The Bay of Bengal, the largest bay in the world,  forms the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean. Roughly triangular in shape, it is bordered mostly by India and Sri Lanka to the west, Bangladesh to the north, and Myanmar (Burma) and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to the east. The Bay of Bengal occupies an area of . A number of large rivers&nbsp;– the Ganges and its tributaries such as the Padma and Hooghly, the Brahmaputra and its tributaries such as the Jamuna and Meghna, other rivers such as the Irrawaddy River, Godavari, Mahanadi, Krishna and Kaveri flow into the Bay of Bengal. Among the important ports are Chennai, Chittagong, Kolkata, Mongla, Paradip, Tuticorin, Visakhapatnam and Yangon. The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Bay of Bengal as follows: :On the east: A line running from Cape Negrais (16°03'N) in Burma through the larger islands of the Andaman group, in such a way that all the narrow waters between the islands lie to the eastward of the line and are excluded from the Bay of Bengal, as far as a point in Little Andaman Island in latitude 10°48'N, longitude 92°24'E and thence along the southwest limit of the Burma Sea [A line running from Oedjong Raja () in Sumatra to Poeloe Bras (Breuëh) and on through the Western Islands of the Nicobar Group to Sandy Point in Little Andaman Island, in such a way that all the narrow waters appertain to the Burma Sea]. :On the south: Adam's Bridge (between India and Ceylon [Sri Lanka]) and from the southern extreme of Dondra Head (south point of Ceylon) to the north point of Poeloe Bras (). In ancient Hindu scriptures, this water body is referred to as '''Mahodadhi''' ([[Sanskrit]]: महोदधि, lit. ''great water receptacle'')<ref name="Kuttan">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nERVRxj22W0C&pg=PA243 | title=The Great Philosophers of India | publisher=AuthorHouse | author=Kuttan | year=2009 | isbn=978-1434377807}}</ref><ref name="indiatourism4u">{{cite web | url=http://www.indiatourism4u.in/tourism/960/Tamil-Nadu/Dhanushkodi/ | title=Dhanushkodi | publisher=indiatourism4u.in | accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref> while it appears as ''Sinus Gangeticus'' or ''Gangeticus Sinus'', meaning "Gulf of the Ganges", in ancient maps.<ref>[[commons:File:1794 Anville Map of the Ancient World - Geographicus - AncientWorld-anville-1794.jpg|1794, Orbis Veteribus Notus by Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]]</ref>  The other Sanskrit names for Bay of Bengal are '<nowiki/>''Vangopasagara''<nowiki/>' (Sanskrit: वङ्गोपसागर, lit. ''Bengal's Bay''), also simply called as '<nowiki/>''Vangasagara''<nowiki/>' (Sanskrit: वङ्गसागर, lit. ''Bengal Sea'') and '<nowiki/>''Purvapayodhi''' (Sanskrit: पूर्वपयोधि, lit. ''Eastern Ocean'').  == Rivers == Many major [[Rivers of India|rivers of the Indian subcontinent]] flow west to east before draining into the Bay of Bengal. The [[Ganges]] is the northernmost of theses. Its main channel enters and flows through Bangladesh, where it is known as the [[Padma River]], before joining the [[Meghna River]]. However, the [[Brahmaputra River]] flows from east to west in [[Assam]] before turning south and entering Bangladesh where it is called the [[Jamuna River]]. This joins the Padma whereupon the Padma joins the [[Meghna River]] that finally drains into Bay of Bengal. The [[Sundarbans]] mangrove forest at the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers lies partly in West Bengal and partly in Bangladesh. The Brahmaputra at {{convert|2948|km|mi|abbr=on}} is the 28th [[List of rivers by length|longest River]] in the world. It originates in [[Tibet]]. The [[Hooghly River]], another channel of the [[Ganga]] that flows through [[Calcutta]] drains into Bay of Bengal in India itself.  The Ganga–Brahmaputra rivers deposits nearly 1000 million tons of [[sediment]] per year. The sediment from these two rivers forms the Bengal Delta and the [[submarine fan]], a vast structure that extends from Bangladesh to south of the Equator, is up to {{convert|16.5|km}} thick, and contains at least 1,130 trillion tonnes of sediment, which has accumulated over the last 17 million years at an  average rate of 665 million tons per annum.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/apr252003/1041.pdf |format=PDF|title=  A sediment budget for the Ganga–Brahmaputra catchment|first=Robert|last=Wasson|year=2003|journal=Current Science|volume=84|issue=8|pages=1041–1047}}</ref> The Bay of Bengal used to be deeper than the [[Mariana Trench]], the present deepest ocean point.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The fan has buried organic carbon at a rate of nearly 1.1 trillion mol/yr since the early [[Miocene]] period. The two rivers currently contribute nearly 8% of the [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) deposited in the world's oceans. Due to high TOC accumulation in the deep sea bed of the Bay of Bengal, the area is rich in oil and natural gas and [[gas hydrate]] reserves. Bangladesh can [[Land reclamation|reclaim land]] substantially and economically from the sea area by constructing sea [[Levee|dikes]], bunds, [[causeway]]s and by trapping the sediment from its rivers.  Further south of Bengal, the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Kaveri River]]s are the major rivers that flow from west to east in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and drain into the Bay of Bengal. Many small rivers also drain directly into the Bay of Bengal; the shortest of them is the [[Cooum River]] at {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}}.  The [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy (or Ayeyarwady) River]] in [[Myanmar]] flows into the [[Andaman Sea]] of the Bay of Bengal and once had thick [[Myanmar Coast mangroves|mangrove]] forest of its own.  == Sea ports == [[File:VizagPort.jpg|thumb|250px|The city of [[Visakhapatnam]] in India, is a major port of '''Bay of Bengal''']]  Some of the biggest ports in the world&nbsp;— [[Chennai Port|Chennai]], [[Visakhapatnam Port|Visakhapatnam]], [[Port of Kolkata|Kolkata]] in [[India]] as well as [[Port of Chittagong|Chittagong]] and [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] in [[Bangladesh]]— are located in the bay. Other Indian ports on the bay include: [[Kakinada Port|Kakinada]], [[Pondicherry]], [[Paradip]], [[Dhamra]], [[Gopalpur-on-Sea|Gopalpur]].  == Islands == The islands in the bay are numerous, including the [[Andaman Islands]], [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] and [[Mergui]] groups of India. The Cheduba group of islands, in the north-east, off the Burmese coast, are remarkable for a chain of mud volcanoes, which are occasionally active. [[Great Andaman]] is the main archipelago or island group of the [[Andaman Islands]], whereas [[Ritchie's Archipelago]] consists of smaller islands.

Underneath the Bay of Bengal is the [[Indian Plate]] which is part of the great [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and is slowly moving north east. This plate meets the [[Burma Plate|Burma Microplate]] at the [[Sunda Trench]]. The [[Nicobar Islands]], and the [[Andaman Islands]] are part of the [[Burma Plate|Burma Microplate]]. The India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate at the [[Sunda Trench]] or Java Trench. Here, the pressure of the two plates on each other increase pressure and temperature resulting in the formation of volcanoes such as the [[List of volcanoes in Myanmar|volcanoes in Myanmar]], and a [[volcanic arc]] called the [[Sunda Arc]]. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and Asian Tsunami]] was a result of the pressure at this zone causing a [[submarine earthquake]] which then resulted in a huge Tsunami.<ref>[http://www.idiom.com/~garcia/tsunami.html Tsunami] URL access 21 January 2007</ref>  === Marine geology ===  A zone 50 m wide extending from the island of Ceylon and the Coromandel coast to the head of the bay, and thence southwards through a strip embracing the Andaman and Nicobar islands, is bounded by the 100 fathom line of sea bottom; some 50 m. beyond this lies the 500-fathom limit. Opposite the mouth of the Ganges, however, the intervals between these depths are very much extended by deltaic influence.

It is considered to be a combination of vehicle exhaust, smoke from cooking fires, and industrial discharges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/shownh.php3?img_id=13341 |title=EO Natural Hazards: Smog over the Bay of Bengal |website=NASA Earth Observatory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026204458/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/shownh.php3?img_id=13341 |archive-date=26 October 2007 |access-date=21 January 2007}}</ref>  == Transboundary issues affecting the marine ecosystem == {{refimprove section|date=December 2012}} A transboundary issue is defined as an environmental problem in which either the cause of the problem and/or its impact is separated by a national boundary; or the problem contributes to a global environmental problem and finding regional solutions is considered to be a global environmental benefit. The eight Bay of Bengal countries have (2012) identified three major transboundary problems (or areas of concern) affecting the health of the Bay, that they can work on together.  With the support of the [[Bay Of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem Project]] (BOBLME), the eight countries are now (2012) developing responses to these issues and their causes, for future implementation as the Strategic Action Programme.  === Overexploitation of fisheries === [[Fisheries]] production in the Bay of Bengal is six million tonnes per year, more than seven percent of the world's catch. The major transboundary issues relating to shared fisheries are: a decline in the overall availability of fish resources; changes in species composition of catches; the high proportion of juvenile fish in the catch; and changes in [[marine biodiversity]], especially through loss of vulnerable and [[endangered species]]. The transboundary nature of these issues are:  that many [[fish stocks]] are shared between BOBLME countries through the transboundary migration of [[fish]], or [[Ichthyoplankton|larvae]]. [[Fishing]] overlaps national jurisdictions, both legally and illegally&nbsp;– overcapacity and [[overfishing]] in one location forces a migration of fishers and vessels to other locations.  All countries (to a greater or lesser degree) are experiencing difficulties in implementing [[fisheries management]], especially the [[ecosystem approach to fisheries]].  Bay of Bengal countries contribute significantly to the global problem of loss of [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] and [[endangered species|endangered]] species. The main causes of the issues are: open access to fishing grounds; Government emphasis on increasing fish catches; inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers; increasing fishing effort, especially from [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]] and [[purse seiners]]; high consumer demand for fish, including for seed and [[fishmeal]] for [[aquaculture]]; ineffective fisheries management; and illegal and destructive fishing.  === Degradation of critical habitats === The Bay of Bengal is an area of high biodiversity, with a large number of [[endangered species|endangered]] and [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] species. The major transboundary issues relating to habitats are:  the loss and degradation of [[mangrove|mangrove habitats]]; [[Environmental issues with coral reefs|degradation of coral reefs]]; and the loss of, and damage to, [[seagrasses]]. The transboundary nature of these major issues are:  that all three critical habitats occur in all BOBLME countries.  [[Coastal development hazards|Coastal development]] for several varying uses of the land and sea are common in all BOBLME countries. Trade in products from all the habitats is transboundary in nature. [[Climate change]] impacts are shared by all BOBLME countries. The main causes of the issues are:  [[food security]] needs of the coastal poor; lack of [[Coastal management|coastal development plans]]; increasing trade in products from coastal habitats; coastal development and industrialization; ineffective [[marine protected area]]s and lack of enforcement; upstream development that affects water-flow; [[Nonpoint source pollution|intensive upstream agricultural practices]]; and increasing tourism.  === Pollution and water quality === The major transboundary issues relating to [[marine pollution|pollution]] and [[water quality]] are:  sewage-borne pathogens and organic load; solid waste/marine litter; increasing nutrient inputs; oil pollution; persistent organic pollutants ([[Persistent organic pollutant|POPs]]) and persistent toxic substances (PTSs); sedimentation; and heavy metals. The transboundary nature of these issues are: discharge of untreated/partially treated [[sewage]] being a common problem.  Sewage and organic discharges from the [[Ganges]]-[[Brahmaputra]]-[[Meghna]] River are likely to be transboundary. Plastics and derelict fishing gear can be transported long distances across national boundaries. High nutrient discharges from rivers could intensify largescale hypoxia.  Atmospheric transport of nutrients is inherently transboundary.  Differences between countries with regard to regulation and enforcement of shipping discharges may drive discharges across boundaries.  [[Tarball (oil)|Tar balls]] are transported long distances. POPs/PTSs and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], including organo-mercury, undergo long-range transport. [[Sedimentation]] and most heavy metal contamination tend to be localized and lack a strong transboundary dimension. The main causes of the issues are:  increasing coastal population density and urbanization; higher consumption, resulting in more waste generated per person; insufficient funds allocated to waste management; migration of industry into BOBLME countries; and proliferation of small industries.  == History ==  [[File:Andaman ross is.jpg|thumb|Ross Island, in the [[Andaman islands|Andamans]], was one of the main naval bases of [[British India]] during [[World War II]]]]  [[Northern Circars]] occupied the western coast of the Bay of Bengal and is now considered to be India's Madras state. [[Chola dynasty]] (9th century to 12th century) when ruled by [[Rajaraja Chola I]] occupied the western coastline of the Bay of Bengal [[History of India#Chola empire|circa AD&nbsp;1014]], The Bay of Bengal was also called as the Chola Lake.The [[Kakatiya dynasty]] reached the western coastline of the Bay of Bengal between the Godavari and the Krishna rivers.  [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]] about the middle of the [[History of India#Early middle kingdoms - the golden age|1st century AD]] invaded northern India perhaps extending as far as the Bay of Bengal. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] extended the [[Military history of India#Maurya dynasty|Maurya Dynasty]] across northern India to the Bay of Bengal.  [[Diamond Harbour|Hajipur]] was a stronghold of Portuguese Pirates. In the 16th century the Portuguese built trading posts in the north of the Bay of Bengal at Chittagong (Porto Grande) and [[Saptagram|Satgaon]] (Porto Pequeno).<ref>[http://www.colonialvoyage.com/bengal.html The Portuguese in Bengal.

A specialized branch, [[Archaeology of shipwrecks]] studies the salvaged artifacts of ancient ships. Stone anchors, amphorae shards, elephant tusks, hippopotamus teeth, ceramic pottery, a rare wood mast and lead ingots are examples which may survive the test of time for archaeologists to study and place the salvaged findings into a time line of history. coral reefs, tsunamis, cyclones, mangrove swamps, battles and a criss cross of sea routes in a high trading area combined with pirating have all contributed to shipwrecks in the Bay of Bengal.<ref>[http://drs.nio.org/drs/bitstream/2264/30/3/Man_Environ_29_28.pdf Marine Archaeology in India] URL accessed 22 January 2007</ref>  === Famous ships and shipwrecks === * 1778 to 1783 The [[Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War]] or American War of Independence ranged as far as the Bay of Bengal. * c. 1816 ''Mornington'' ship burned in the Bay of Bengal.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/Wrecks/wrecks1816-1818.shtml Shipwrecks 1816-1818] URL accessed 10 January 2015</ref> * 1850 American clipper brig ''Eagle'' is supposed to have sunk in the Bay of Bengal.<ref>[http://www.maritimeheritage.org/ships/wrecks.html The Maritime Heritage Project: Gold Rush Ships, Passengers, Captains] URL accessed 23 January 2007</ref> * American Baptist missionary [[Adoniram Judson]], Jr. died 12 April 1850 and was buried at sea in the Bay of Bengal. * 1855 The Bark "Incredible" struck on a sunken rock in the Bay of Bengal.<ref>[http://www.islandregister.com/shippingnotes.html Shipping Notes from the 1800s - P.E.I.] URL accessed 23 January 2007</ref> * 1865, a gale dismasted the [[Star of India (ship)|''Euterpe'']] while traversing the Bay of Bengal typhoon. * 1875 ''Veleda'' 76&nbsp;m (250&nbsp;ft) long and 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) wide is a part of a current salvage operation.<ref>[http://www.diving-industry.com/news/2006/05/06/sunken-ship-possibly-older-than-titanic-discovered/  Diving-News.com » Wrecks] URL accessed 23 January 2007</ref> * 1942 [[Japanese cruiser Yura|Japanese cruiser ''Yura'']] of the Second Expeditionary Fleet, Malay Force attacked merchant ships in the Bay of Bengal. * 1971 December 3 - It was claimed that [[Indian Navy]] destroyer [[INS Rajput|INS ''Rajput'']] sunk the [[Pakistan Navy]] [[submarine]] [[PNS Ghazi|PNS ''Ghazi'']] off [[Visakhapatnam]], in the Bay of Bengal.  == See also ==  * [[West Bengal]] * [[Andaman Islands]] * [[Bengal]] * [[United Bengal]] * [[Bengali language]] * [[St. Martin's Island]]  == References == {{EB1911|wstitle=Bengal, Bay of}} {{Reflist|2}}  == Further reading == * [http://www.nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=449 The Maritime Boundary Dispute Between Bangladesh and Myanmar: Motivations, Potential Solutions, and Implications] by Jared Bissinger (''Asia Policy'', July 2010) published by [[National Bureau of Asian Research]]  == External links == {{wiktionary|Bay of Bengal}} {{Commons category|Bay of Bengal}} * [http://www.india-seminar.com/2000/487/487%20suryanarayan.htm 487 V.
