      , also known as  or ANA, is the largest airline in Japan. Its headquarters are located at Shiodome City Center in the Shiodome area of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. It operates services to both domestic and international destinations and had 12,360 employees as of March 2015. In May 2010, ANA's total passenger traffic was up year-on-year by 7.8%, and its international services grew by 22% to 2.07 million passengers in the first five months of 2010.   ANA's main international hubs are at Narita International Airport outside Tokyo and Kansai International Airport outside Osaka. Its main domestic hubs are at Tokyo International Airport (Haneda), Osaka International Airport Itami, Chūbu Centrair International Airport (near Nagoya), and New Chitose Airport (near Sapporo). In addition to its mainline operations, ANA controls several subsidiary passenger carriers, including its regional airline, ANA Wings and charter carrier, Air Japan. Additional smaller carriers include Air Do, a low-cost carrier operating scheduled service between Tokyo and cities in Hokkaido, Vanilla Air, a low-cost carrier serving resort and selected international destinations, and Allex Cargo (ANA Cargo), the freighter division operated by Air Japan. In October 1999, the airline became a member of Star Alliance. ANA is also the largest shareholder in Peach, a low-cost carrier joint venture with First Eastern Investment Group. On 29 March 2013, ANA was announced as a 5-Star Airline by Skytrax. ANA's earliest ancestor was , an airline company founded on 27 December 1952. Nippon Helicopter was the source of what would later be ANA's IATA airline code, NH.   NH began helicopter services in February 1953. On 15 December 1953, it operated its first cargo flight between Osaka and Tokyo using a de Havilland Dove, JA5008. This was the first scheduled flight flown by a Japanese pilot in postwar Japan. Passenger service on the same route began on 1 February 1954, and was upgraded to a de Havilland Heron in March. In 1955, Douglas DC-3s began flying for NH as well, by which time the airline's route network extended from northern Kyūshū to Sapporo. ANA's other ancestor was . Although it was founded on 26 December 1952, one day before NH, it did not begin operations until 20 January 1954, when it began night cargo runs between Osaka and Tokyo, also using a de Havilland Dove. It adopted the DC-3 in early 1957, by which point its route network extended through southern Japan from Tokyo to Kagoshima. FEA merged with NH in March 1958. The combined companies had a total market capitalization of 600 million yen, and the result of the merger was Japan's largest private airline.  The merged airline, called All Nippon Airways, received a new Japanese name (全日本空輸 Zen Nippon Kūyu; Japan Air Transport). The company logo of the larger NH was selected as the logo of the new combined airline, and the new carrier operated a route network combined from its two predecessors.  ANA grew through the 1960s, adding the Vickers Viscount to the fleet in 1960 and the Fokker F27 in 1961. October 1961 marked ANA's debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as well as the Osaka Securities Exchange.  1963 saw another merger, with Fujita Airlines, raising the company's capital to 4.65 billion yen.  In 1965 ANA introduced jets with Boeing 727s on the Tokyo-Sapporo route. It also introduced Japan's first homegrown turboprop airliner, the NAMC YS-11 in 1965, replacing Convair 440s on local routes. In 1969, ANA introduced Boeing 737 services.  As ANA grew it started to contract travel companies across Japan to handle ground services in each region.   Many of these companies received shares in ANA as part of their deals. Some of these relationships continue today in different forms: for instance, Nagoya Railroad, which handled ANA's operations in the Chūbu region along with other partnerships, maintains a permanent seat on ANA's board of directors. By 1974, ANA had Japan's largest domestic airline network. While ANA's domestic operations grew, the Ministry of Transportation had granted government-owned Japan Airlines (JAL) a monopoly on international scheduled flights that lasted until 1986. ANA was allowed to operate international charter flights: its first was a 727 charter from Tokyo to Hong Kong on 21 February 1971. ANA bought its first widebody aircraft, six Lockheed L-1011s, in November 1971, following a lengthy sales effort by Lockheed which had involved negotiations between US president Richard Nixon, Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka and UK prime minister Edward Heath (lobbying in favor of engine maker Rolls-Royce). Tanaka also pressed Japanese regulators to permit ANA to operate on Asia routes as part of the package. The aircraft entered service on the Tokyo-Okinawa route in 1974. The carrier had ordered McDonnell Douglas DC-10s but cancelled the order at the last minute and switched to Lockheed. It was later revealed that Lockheed had indirectly bribed Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka to force this switch: the scandal led to the arrest of Tanaka and several managers from ANA and Lockheed sales agent Marubeni for corruption. Boeing 747-200s were introduced on the Tokyo-Sapporo and Tokyo-Fukuoka routes in 1976 and Boeing 767s in 1983 on Shikoku routes. The carrier's first 747s were the short-range SR variant, designed for Japanese domestic routes.  In 1986, ANA began to expand beyond Japan's key domestic carrier to become a competitive international carrier as well. On 3 March 1986, ANA started scheduled international flights with a passenger service from Tokyo to Guam.'The History of ANA's 20 years of international flight Service', ANA Sky Web (June 2006). Retrieved 2 September 2006.  Flights to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. followed by year's end, and ANA also entered a service agreement with American Airlines to feed the US carrier's new flights to Narita. ANA expanded its international services gradually: to Beijing, Dalian, Hong Kong and Sydney in 1987; to Seoul in 1988; to London and Saipan in 1989; to Paris in 1990 and to New York in 1991. Airbus equipment such as the A320 and A321 was added to the fleet in the early 1990s, as was the Boeing 747-481 jet. ANA joined the Star Alliance in October 1999. 2004 saw ANA's profits exceed JAL's for the first time. That year, facing a surplus of slots due to the construction of new airports and the ongoing expansion of Tokyo International Airport, ANA announced a fleet renewal plan that would replace some of its large aircraft with a greater number of smaller aircraft. Also in 2004, ANA set up low-cost subsidiary Air Next to operate flights from Fukuoka Airport starting in 2005, and became the majority shareholder in Nakanihon Airline Service (NAL) headquartered in Nagoya Airport..  In 2005, ANA renamed NAL to Air Central, and relocated its headquarters to Chūbu Centrair International Airport.Air Central, . Air Central (in Japanese) browsed 21 January 2008. On 12 July 2005, ANA reached a deal with NYK to sell its 27.6% share in Nippon Cargo Airlines, a joint venture formed between the two companies in 1987.ANA to Sell Share in Nippon Cargo Airlines to NYK All Nippon Airways official website browsed 21 January 2008 The sale allowed ANA to focus on developing its own cargo division. In 2006, ANA, Japan Post, Nippon Express, and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines founded ANA & JP Express (AJV), which would operate freighters. ANA is the top shareholder of AJV. It absorbed Air Japan's freighter operations. Air Transport World named ANA its 2007 "Airline of the Year." In 2006, the airline was recognized by FlightOnTime.info as the most punctual scheduled airline between London and Tokyo for the last four consecutive years, based on official British statistics.  Japan Airlines took over the title in 2007. In 2009, ANA announced plans to test an idea as part of the airline's "e-flight" campaign, encouraging passengers on select flights to visit the airport restroom before they board. On 10 November of the same year, ANA also announced "Inspiration of Japan", ANA's newest international flight concept, with redesigned cabins initially launched on its 777-300ER aircraft. July 2011, All Nippon Airways and AirAsia have agreed to form a low-cost carrier AirAsia Japan based in Tokyo's Narita International Airport. ANA held 51 percent shares and AirAsia held 33 percent voting shares and 16 percent non-voting shares through its wholly owned subsidiary, AA International. The carrier lasted until October 2013, when AirAsia withdrew from the joint venture; the carrier was subsequently rebranded as Vanilla Air.

ANA co-founded NCA with shipping company Nippon Yusen in 1978, and at one time held 27.5% of NCA's stock. ANA sold its stake to NYK in 2005, but retained a technical partnership with NCA. ANA announced in July 2013 that it would charter NCA's 747 freighter aircraft for an overnight cargo run between Narita and Okinawa, doubling capacity between ANA's key cargo hubs and freeing up 767 aircraft to operate new routes from Okinawa to Nagoya and Qingdao. As of 2014, ANA has around 5,000 flight attendants, around 400 of whom are non-Japanese (mainly European, Chinese, Korean, Hongkongese and Thai). ANA plans to increase its non-Japanese cabin staff headcount to 550 by fiscal year 2016 with a focus on recruiting in Southeast Asia.  ANA has an extensive domestic route network that covers the entirety of Japan, from Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa in the south.

The NAMC YS-11 was an important aircraft for All Nippon Airways, although most of them were used under the name of ANK, or Air Nippon, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways. The final YS-11 in operation was retired in 2006.  A number of YS-11s are in museums, or otherwise scrapped or taken apart. After a final retirement process through September 2006, all YS-11s were grounded, obligated to retire, unless privately owned and were privately restored. The YS-11 was a big part of All Nippon Airways from the 1970s to the early 1990s, when it was used on domestic operations. ANA flew its last flight of an Airbus A321 on 29 February 2008. This marked the end of almost ten years of operation of the Airbus A321, of which ANA was the only Japanese operator.ANAわかりやすいニュース配信 ありがとう、エアバスA321型機。ラストフライトをレポート  ANA was the launch customer for the new Boeing widebody, the 787 Dreamliner, ordering 50 examples with an option for 50 more during April 2004. ANA split the order between 30 of the short-range 787-3 and 20 of the long haul 787-8. However, ANA later converted its -3 orders to the -8 variant.  Deliveries finally began in late 2011 when ANA received its first Boeing 787 on 21 September, the first ever Dreamliner to be delivered in the world. ANA flew its first Boeing 787 passenger flight on 26 October 2011, which operated as a charter flight from Tokyo Narita to Hong Kong. ANA also became the second airline to receive the Boeing 787-9&ndash;on 28 July 2014. Despite being second, the airline preceded launch customer Air New Zealand for the first commercial flight on the 787-9, a special sightseeing charter for Japanese and American school children on 4 August.

Boeing valued ANA’s order at approximately $13 billion at list prices. On 2 February 2015, ANA placed orders with Airbus and Boeing worth $2.2bn for three Boeing 787-10s, five Boeing 737-800s and seven Airbus A321s.

ANA operates 20 special livery aircraft:  All Nippon Airways Boeing 767 - Special Woody Woodpecker Scheme photo - René Juncker photos at pbase.com Introduced in 2009, the "Inspiration of Japan" cabin features included fully-lie-flat-bed business class seats, nearly enclosed first class suite seats, fixed shell back seats in both of its economy classes, a new AVOD in-flight entertainment system (based on Panasonic Avionics Corporation's eX2 IFE system with iPod connectivity, in-seat shopping and meal ordering as well as cabin touchscreen consoles) as well as improvements to its in-flight service. ANA will also introduce a new lounge (which opened on 20 February 2010, supposed to be in coincidence with the introduction of new aircraft interiors but delayed [see below]) and check-in concept (later in autumn 2010) at Narita for first class and ANA Mileage Club's Diamond Service elite members. The introduction of the concept also discontinued the use of the name "Club ANA", which was used for its international business class seats (changing into a generic business class name) as well as the name of the lounges (all lounges for both first class and business class are named "ANA Lounge", with the first class lounge called the "ANA Suite Lounge" and its arrival lounge the "ANA Arrival Lounge"). This "Inspiration of Japan" concept was originally set to debut on 20 February 2010 with the delivery of its new Boeing 777-300ER prior to that date, followed by the introduction of the concept on that date on the Narita-New York route. However, due to delays to the new premium economy seats, the debut was pushed back to 19 April. (The delay was due to the failure of a safety test in Japan of a new seat design axle, made by seat manufacturer Koito Industries Ltd. This safety test failure also affected deliveries of aircraft to be operated by three other fellow Star Alliance members - Singapore Airlines for its A380s, Thai Airways' A330s, and Continental Airlines for new 737-800 deliveries.) The "Inspiration of Japan" concept has been refitted on its existing 777-300ERs for service on all the airline's North American routes, and may be refitted on its European routes. Parts of it may eventually be phased into its existing Boeing 767-300ERs in service as well as the upcoming Boeing 787s in order.
