     Empress Dowager Cixi1 (also romanised as Empress Dowager Tzu-hsi; ; ; Manchu: Tsysi taiheo; 29 November 1835 – 15 November 1908), of the Manchu Yehenara clan, was a Chinese empress dowager and regent who effectively controlled the Chinese government in the late Qing dynasty for 47 years from 1861 until her death in 1908. Selected as an imperial concubine of the Xianfeng Emperor in her adolescence, she gave birth to a son, Zaichun, in 1856. After the Xianfeng Emperor's death in 1861, the young boy became the Tongzhi Emperor, and she became the Empress Dowager. Cixi ousted a group of regents appointed by the late emperor and assumed regency, which she shared with Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi then consolidated control over the dynasty when she installed her nephew as the Guangxu Emperor at the death of the Tongzhi Emperor in 1875, contrary to the traditional rules of succession of the Qing dynasty that had ruled China since 1644. Although she refused to adopt Western models of government, she supported technological and military reforms and the Self-Strengthening Movement. Although she agreed with the Hundred Days' Reforms of 1898, Cixi rejected them as detrimental to dynastic power and placed the Guangxu Emperor under house arrest for supporting radical reformers, who had tried to assassinate her. She subsequently covered up the Emperor's support of the assassination attempt and the reformers, as it was a breach of filial piety, a pillar of Chinese society at the time. Any perceived weakness in the Imperial Court would have been pounced upon by the Japanese, who had the ultimate goal of annexing China and forming a "East Asian Merger"; Cixi's interests had always been the preservation of her country and dynasty. After the Boxer Rebellion and the invasion of Allied armies, Cixi returned to Beijing from Xi'an, where she had fled to during the invasion of Beijing, and upon her return, she immediately began to effect the institutional changes she had always wanted; on arrival one of her first decrees was the banning of foot binding."Cixi Outlaws Foot Binding", History Channel Cixi was also responsible for the legislation that began the process of turning China into a constitutional monarchy. Many historians both in China and abroad have portrayed her as a despot responsible for the fall of the Qing dynasty. Others have suggested that her opponents among the reformers succeeded in making her a scapegoat for problems beyond her control. Furthermore, they claim that she intervened decisively to prevent political disorder, was no more ruthless than other rulers of her time, and that she was an effective reformer in the last years of her life, even if she was reluctant to take on this role.Sue Fawn Chung, "The Much Maligned Empress Dowager: A Revisionist Study of the Empress Dowager Tz'u-Hsi (1835–1908)," Modern Asian Studies 13.2  (1979):  177–196.    Empress Cixi was born in the winter of 1835. According to the information listed on a red sheet (File No. 1247) in the "Miscellaneous Pieces of the Palace" (a Qing dynasty documentation package retrieved from the First Historical Archives of China), Cixi was the daughter of Huizheng, an ordinary official from the Manchu Yehenara clan. Palace archives also show that Huizheng was a member of Bordered Blue Banner of the Eight Banners and was working in Beijing during the year of Cixi's birth, an indication that she was born in Beijing. The file records the location of Cixi's childhood home: Firewood Alley of West Sipailou, Beijing (Chinese: 西四牌楼劈柴胡同). In 1851, Cixi participated in the selection for consorts to the new Xianfeng Emperor alongside sixty other candidates. Cixi was one of the few candidates chosen to stay. Placed in the 6th rank of consorts, she was styled "Noble Lady Lan" (Chinese: 蘭贵人). Among the other chosen candidates were Noble Lady Li of the Tatala clan (later Consort Li), Concubine Yun of the Wugiya clan, and Concubine Zhen of the Niuhuru clan (later Xianfeng's empress consort). In 1854, Cixi was elevated to the 5th rank of consorts and given the title "Imperial Concubine Yi" (Chinese: 懿嫔). In 1855, Cixi became pregnant. On 27 April 1856, she gave birth to Zaichun, the Xianfeng Emperor's only surviving son. Soon afterward, she was elevated to the 4th rank of consorts as "Consort Yi" (Chinese: 懿妃).Laidler, Keith (2003), "The Last Empress" (p. 58), John Wiley & Sons Inc., ISBN 0-470-84881-2. In 1857, when her son reached his first birthday, Cixi was elevated to the 3rd rank of consorts as "Noble Consort Yi" (Chinese: 懿贵妃). This rank placed her second only to the Empress Ci'an among the women within Xianfeng's household. Unlike many of the other Manchu women in the imperial household, Cixi was known for her ability to read and write Chinese. This skill granted her numerous opportunities to help the ailing emperor in the governing of the Chinese state on a daily basis. On various occasions, the Xianfeng Emperor had Cixi read palace memorials for him and leave instructions on the memorials according to his will. As a result, Cixi became well-informed about state affairs and the art of governing from the ailing emperor.http://www.56.com/u11/v_MjYwNjk3NjI.html In September 1860, during the closing stages of the Second Opium War, the British diplomatic envoy Harry Parkes was arrested and several western hostages were tortured and executed. In retaliation, British and French troops under the command of Lord Elgin attacked Beijing, and by the following month they had burned the Emperor's Old Summer Palace to the ground. The Xianfeng Emperor and his entourage, including Cixi, fled Beijing to Rehe (now Chengde, Hebei) in Manchuria.Immanual Hsu (1985), The Rise of Modern China (pg. 215). On hearing the news of the destruction of the Old Summer Palace, the Xianfeng Emperor (who was already showing signs of dementia) fell into a depression. He turned heavily to alcohol and drugs and became seriously ill.Edward Behr, The Last Emperor, 1987, p. 44 He summoned eight of his most prestigious ministers, headed by Sushun, Zaiyuan, and Duanhua, and named them the "Eight Regent Ministers" to direct and support the future emperor. On 22 August 1861, the Xianfeng Emperor died at Rehe Palace in the city of Rehe. His heir, the son of Noble Consort Yi (future Empress Dowager Cixi), was only five years old. It is commonly assumed that on his deathbed, the Xianfeng Emperor summoned his Empress and Noble Consort Yi and gave each of them a stamp. He hoped that when his son ascended the throne, the Empress and Noble Consort Yi would cooperate in harmony and help the young emperor to grow and mature together. This may also have been done as a check on the power of the Eight Regents. There is no evidence for this incident, however, and it is unlikely that the emperor  ever would have intended the Noble Consort Yi to wield political power. It is possible that the seal, allegedly given as a symbol for the child, was really just a present for Noble Consort Yi (Cixi) herself. Informal seals numbered in the thousands and were not considered political accouterments, rather objects of art commissioned for pleasure by emperors to stamp on items such as paintings, or given as presents to the concubines.[Sui Lijuan: Carrying out the Coup. CCTV-10 Series on Cixi, Ep. 4]  Upon the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, his Empress Consort, aged 25, was elevated to the title Empress Dowager Ci'an. She was popularly known as the East Empress Dowager because she lived in the Eastern Zhong-Cui Palace). Noble Consort Yi, aged 27, was elevated to the title Empress Dowager Cixi, popularly known as the West Empress Dowager (西太后) because she lived inside the Western Chuxiu Palace.  By the time of the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, Empress Dowager Cixi had become a shrewd political strategist. In Rehe, while waiting for an astrologically favorable time to transport the coffin back to Beijing, Cixi conspired with powerful court officials and imperial relatives to seize power. Cixi's position as the lower-ranked Empress Dowager had no intrinsic political power attached to it. In addition, her son the young emperor was not a political force himself. As a result, it became necessary for her to ally herself with other powerful figures, including the late emperor's principal wife, the Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi suggested that they become co-reigning Empress Dowagers, with powers exceeding the Eight Regent Ministers; the two had long been close friends since Cixi first came to the imperial household.Edward Behr, The Last Emperor, 1987, p. 45 Tensions grew between the two Empresses Dowagers and the Eight Regent Ministers, headed by Sushun. The ministers did not appreciate Cixi's interference in political affairs, and their frequent confrontations with the empresses left the Empress Dowager Ci'an frustrated. Ci'an often refused to come to court audiences, leaving Empress Dowager Cixi to deal with the ministers alone. Secretly, Cixi had begun gathering the support of talented ministers, soldiers, and others who were ostracized by the Eight Regent Ministers for personal or political reasons.  Among them was Prince Gong, who had been excluded from power, yet harbored great ambitions, and Prince Chun, the sixth and seventh sons of the Daoguang Emperor, respectively. While Cixi aligned herself with these Princes, a memorial came from Shandong asking for her to "listen to politics behind the curtains," i.e., to assume power as de facto ruler. The same petition also asked Prince Gong to enter the political arena as a principal "aide to the Emperor." When the Xianfeng Emperor's funeral procession left for Beijing, Cixi took advantage of her alliances with Princes Gong and Chun.  She and the boy emperor returned to the capital before the rest of the party, along with Zaiyuan and Duanhua, two of the principal regents, while Sushun was left to accompany the deceased emperor's procession. Cixi's early return to Beijing meant that she had more time to plan with Prince Gong and ensure that the power base of the Eight Regent Ministers was divided between Sushun and his allies, Zaiyuan and Duanhua. In order to remove them from power, history was re-written: the Regents were dismissed for having carried out incompetent negotiations with the "barbarians" that had caused the Xianfeng Emperor to flee to Rehe "greatly against his will," among other charges. To display her high moral standards, Cixi executed only three of the eight regent ministers. Prince Gong had suggested that Sushun and others be executed by the most painful method, known as slow slicing, or Death by a Thousand Cuts, but Cixi declined the suggestion and ordered that Sushun be beheaded, while the other two also marked for execution, Zaiyuan and Duanhua, were given white silks to allow them to commit suicide. In addition, Cixi refused outright the idea of executing the family members of the ministers, as would be done in accordance with imperial tradition of an alleged usurper. Ironically, Qing imperial tradition also dictated that women and princes were never to engage in politics. In breaking with tradition, Cixi became the only Qing Dynasty Empress to rule from "behind the curtains" (垂簾聽政). This palace coup is known as the "Xinyou Palace Coup" () in China after the name of the year 1861 in the Sexagenary cycle. In November 1861, a few days following her coup d'état, Cixi was quick to reward Yixin, the Prince Gong, for his help. He was made head of the General Affairs Office and the Internal Affairs Office, and his daughter was made a Gurun Princess, a title usually bestowed only on the Empress's first-born daughter. However, Cixi avoided giving Yixin the absolute political power that princes such as Dorgon exercised during the Shunzhi Emperor's reign.  As one of the first acts from "behind the curtains," Cixi (nominally along with Ci'an) issued two important Imperial Edicts on behalf of the emperor. The first stated that the two Empresses Dowager were to be the sole decision makers "without interference," and the second changed the boy emperor's era name from Qixiang (祺祥; "Auspicious") to Tongzhi (同治; "collective stable"). Despite being the sole decision makers, both Ci'an and Cixi were forced to rely on the Grand Council and a complex series of procedures in order to deal with affairs of state. When state documents came in, they were to be first forwarded to the empresses, then referred back to the prince adviser and the Grand Council. Having discussed the matters, the prince and his colleagues would seek the instruction of the empresses at audiences and imperial orders would be drawn up accordingly, with drafts having to be approved by the empresses before edicts were issued.<ref>Kwong, Luke S.K. ''A Mosaic of the Hundred Days: Personalities, Politics and Ideas of 1898 ''(Harvard University Press 1984), pg. 21</ref>  It also seems that the most important role of the empresses during the regency was merely to apply their seals to edicts, a merely mechanical role in a complex bureaucracy.<ref>Kwong, pg. 22</ref>  ===Cleaning up the bureaucracy=== Cixi's ascendancy as the absolute power figure in China came at a time of internal chaos and foreign challenges. The effects of the [[Second Opium War]] were still hovering over the country, and the [[Taiping Rebellion]] continued its seemingly unstoppable advance through China's south, eating up the Qing Empire bit by bit. Internally, both the national bureaucracy and regional authorities were infested with corruption. 1861 happened to be the year of official examinations, whereby officials of all levels presented their political reports from the previous three years. Cixi decided that the time was ripe for a bureaucratic overhaul, and she personally sought audience with all officials above the level of provincial governor, who had to report to her personally. Cixi thus took on part of the role usually given to the ''Bureaucratic Affairs Department'' (吏部). Cixi had two prominent officials executed to serve as examples for others: Qingying, a military ''shilang'' who had tried to bribe his way out of demotion, and He Guiqing, then [[Viceroy of Liangjiang]], who fled [[Changzhou]] in the wake of an incoming Taiping army instead of trying to defend the city.  Another significant challenge Cixi faced was the increasingly decrepit state of the country's [[Manchu]] elite. Since the beginning of the dynasty in 1644, most major positions at court had been held by Manchus, and the emperors had generally shown contempt for the majority [[Han Chinese]]. Cixi, again in a reversal of imperial tradition, entrusted the country's most powerful military unit against the Taiping army into the hands of a Han Chinese, [[Zeng Guofan]]. Additionally, in the next three years, Cixi appointed Han Chinese officials to become governors of all southern Chinese provinces, raising alarm bells in an administration traditionally protective of Manchu dominance.  ===Taiping victory and Prince Gong=== [[File:Prince Gong 2.JPG|thumb|upright|Photograph of Prince Gong, Cixi's crucial ally during the Xinyou Coup. He was rewarded by Cixi for his help during her most difficult times, but was eventually eliminated from office by Cixi for his ambition.]] [[File:荣寿固伦公主.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Princess Rongshou (center seated), daughter of Prince Gong. As a way to show gratitude to the Prince, Cixi adopted his daughter, and elevated her to the rank of Kurun Princess (the highest rank for imperial princesses).]]  Under the command of General Zeng Guofan, the victorious [[Xiang Army]] defeated the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Taiping]] army in a hard-fought battle at Tianjing (present-day [[Nanjing]]) in July 1864. Zeng Guofan was rewarded with the title of "Marquess Yiyong, First Class," and his brother Zeng Guoquan, along with [[Li Hongzhang]] and [[Zuo Zongtang]], all Han Chinese generals from the war, were rewarded respectively with auspicious decorations and titles. With the Taiping threat receding, Cixi focused her attention on new internal threats to her power. Of special concern was the position of Yixin, the [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]], and the Chief Policy Advisor (议政王) at Court. Yixin, whose loyalties stretched at least half of the country, also had effectively gathered under his command the support of all outstanding Han Chinese armies. In addition, Yixin controlled daily court affairs as the first-in-charge at the [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]] as well as the ''[[Zongli Yamen]]'', the ''de facto'' ministry of foreign affairs. With his increasing stature, Yixin was considered a serious threat to Cixi and her power.  Although the prince was rewarded for his conduct and recommendation of Zeng Guofan before the Taiping defeat, Cixi was quick to move after [[Cai Shaoqi]], a little-known official who was the recorder at court, filed a [[petition|memorial]] asking for Yixin's resignation. Having built up a powerful base and a network of allies at court, Yixin considered the memorial insignificant. Cixi, however, took the memorial as a stepping stone to Yixin's removal. In April 1865, under the pretext that Yixin had "improper court conduct before the two empresses," among a series of other charges, Yixin was dismissed from all his positions, but was allowed to keep his title.<ref>[http://www.yifan.net/yihe/novels/history/qsgskym/qsg221.html 清史稿：恭忠親王奕訢，宣宗第六子]</ref> The dismissal surprised the nobility and court officials and brought about numerous petitions for his return. [[Yicong]], Prince Tun, as well as Yixuan, the [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]], both sought their brother's reinstatement. Yixin himself, in an audience with the two empresses, burst into tears.<ref>清史稿：恭忠親王奕訢傳記載：“王入謝，痛哭引咎”。</ref> Bowing to popular pressure, Cixi allowed Yixin to return to his position as the head of the foreign ministry, but rid him of his title of Chief Policy Advisor. Yixin would never return to political prominence again, and neither would the liberal and pro-reform policies of his time. Yixin's demotion revealed Cixi's iron grip on Qing politics, and her lack of willingness to give up absolute power to anyone, not even her most important ally in the Xinyou coup, Prince Gong.  ===Foreign influence=== China's loss in the [[Second Opium War]] of 1856 to 1860 was undoubtedly a wake-up call for its imperial rulers. Cixi presided over a country whose military strategies were vastly outdated, both on land and sea and in terms of weaponry. Sensing an immediate threat from foreigners and realizing that China's agricultural-based economy could not hope to compete with the industrial prowess of the West, Cixi made the decision that for the first time in Imperial Chinese history, China would learn from Western powers and import their knowledge and technology. At the time, three prominent Han Chinese officials, [[Zeng Guofan]], [[Li Hongzhang]] and [[Zuo Zongtang]], had all begun industrial programs in the country's southern regions. In supporting these programs, Cixi also decreed the opening of [[Tongwen Guan]] in 1862, a university-like institution in Beijing that hired foreigners as teachers. Tongwen Guan specialized in new-age topics such as astronomy and mathematics, as well as the English, French, and Russian languages. Groups of young boys were also sent abroad to the [[United States]].  China's "learn from foreigners" program quickly met with impediments. China's military institutions were in desperate need of reform. Cixi's solution, under the advice of officials at court, was to purchase seven British warships. When the warships arrived in China, however, they were staffed with British sailors, all under British command. The Chinese were enraged at this "international joke," negotiations broke down between the two parties, and China returned the warships to Britain, where they were to be auctioned off. Scholars sometimes attribute the failure of China's foreign programs to Cixi's conservative attitude and old methods of thinking, and contend that Cixi would learn only so much from the foreigners, provided it did not infringe upon her own power. Under the pretext that a railway was too loud and would "disturb the Emperor's tombs," Cixi forbade its construction. When construction went ahead anyway in 1877 on Li Hongzhang's recommendation, Cixi asked that they be pulled by horse-drawn carts.<ref>[Professor Sui Lijuang: Lecture Room Series on Cixi, Episode 9]</ref> Cixi was especially alarmed at the liberal thinking of people who had studied abroad, and saw that it posed a new threat to her power. In 1881, Cixi put a halt to the policy of sending children abroad to study and withdrew her formerly open attitude towards foreigners.  ===Tongzhi's marriage=== [[File:《孝哲毅皇后朝服像》局部.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Empress Xiaozheyi, also known as Empress Jiashun and "Lady Alute", who had the approval of Empress Dowager Ci'an but never Cixi's. It is widely speculated that the Empress was pregnant with Tongzhi's child and that Cixi orchestrated the Lady's demise.]] [[File:Chinese - Ceremonial Headdress - Walters 863 - Back.jpg|left|thumb|Ceremonial headdress likely worn by Cixi.  The small phoenixes emerging from the surface represent the empress.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]  |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/24285  |title=Ceremonial Headdress }}</ref> The Walters Art Museum]] In 1872, the Tongzhi Emperor turned 17. Under the guidance of the [[Empress Dowager Ci'an]], he was married to [[Empress Xiaozheyi|Empress Jiashun]]. Empress Jiashun's grandfather, [[Duanhua|Prince Zheng]], was one of the eight ministers selected by Xianfeng to guide Tongzhi. He had been Cixi's enemy during the Xinyou Coup and was ordered to commit suicide after Cixi's victory. As a consequence, there were tensions between Cixi and Empress Jiashun, and this was often a source of irritation for Cixi. Moreover, the empress's zodiac symbol of tiger was perceived as life-threatening by the superstitious Cixi, whose own zodiac symbol was a goat. According to Cixi's belief, it was a warning from the gods that she would eventually fall prey to the empress.  As the principal consort of the Emperor, Empress Jiashun was well received by both Tongzhi and the Empress Dowager Ci'an. Her personal consultants once warned her to be more agreeable and docile to Cixi, as Cixi was the figure who truly held the power. She replied: "I am a principal consort, having been carried through the front gate with pomp and circumstance, as mandated by our ancestors. Empress Dowager Cixi was a concubine, and entered our household through a side gate."  Since the very beginning of his marriage, the emperor proceeded to spend most of his time with his empress at the expense of his four concubines, including the [[Imperial Noble Consort Shushen]], who was the empress intended by Cixi. As hostility grew between Cixi and Empress Jiashun, Cixi suggested the couple spend more time on studies and spied on Tongzhi using [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s. After her warning was ignored, Cixi ordered the couple to separate, and Tongzhi purportedly spent several months following Cixi's order in isolation at [[Palace of Heavenly Purity|Qianqing Palace]].  The young emperor, who could no longer cope with his grief and loneliness, grew more and more ill-tempered. He began to treat his servants with cruelty and punished them physically for minor offences. Under the joined influence of court eunuchs and Zaicheng, eldest son of Prince Gong and Tongzhi's contemporary and best friend, Tongzhi managed to escape the palace in search of pleasure in the unrestricted parts of Beijing. For several evenings the emperor disguised himself as a commoner and secretly spent the nights in the brothels of Beijing. The emperor's sexual habits became common talk among court officials and commoners, and there are many records of Tongzhi's escapades.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  ===Tongzhi's deficiencies in ruling=== [[File:《游艺怡情图》.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of the Tongzhi Emperor doing his coursework. Cixi's high expectations of him caused his strong distaste for learning.]]  Tongzhi received a rigorous education from four famous teachers of Cixi's own choosing: Li Hongzao, Qi Junzao, Weng Xincun, and Wo Ren. This group was later joined by Xincun's son [[Weng Tonghe]]; the emperor's governor, also selected by Cixi, was Mianyu. The imperial teachers instructed the emperor in the classics and various old texts for which the emperor displayed little or no interest.  The pressure and stress put upon the young emperor made him despise learning for the majority of his life. According to Weng Tonghe's diary, the emperor could not read a memorandum in full sentences by age sixteen. Worried about her son's inability to learn, Cixi only pressured Tongzhi more. When he was given personal rule at age 18, in November 1873 (four years behind the usual custom), Tongzhi proved to be an incompetent emperor.  Tongzhi made two important policy decisions during his short stint of rule, which lasted from 1873 to 1875. First, he decreed that the [[Yuanmingyuan|Imperial Summer Palace]], destroyed by the English and French in the Second Opium War, would be completely rebuilt under the pretext that it was a gift to Cixi and Ci'an. Historians also suggest that it was an attempt to drive Cixi from the [[Forbidden City]] so that he could rule without interference in policy or his private affairs.  The imperial treasury was almost depleted at the time from internal strife and foreign wars, and as a result, Tongzhi asked the Board of Finance to forage for the necessary funds. In addition, he encouraged members of the nobility and high officials to donate funds from their personal resources. Once construction began, Tongzhi checked its progress on a monthly basis, and would often spend days away from court, indulging himself in pleasures outside of the Forbidden City.  Uneasy about the emperor's neglect of national affairs, Princes Yixin and Yixuan ([[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]]), along with the top officials of the imperial court, submitted a joint memorandum asking the Emperor to cease the construction of the Summer Palace, among other recommendations. Tongzhi, unwilling to submit to criticism, issued an Imperial Edict in August 1874 to rid Yixin of his title of prince and be demoted to the status of a commoner. Two days later, [[Yicong]], Yixuan, Yihui, Jingshou, [[Yikuang, Prince Qing|Yikuang]], [[Wenxiang]], Baoju, and Grand Councillors Shen Guifen and Li Hongzao were all to be stripped of their respective titles and jobs.  Seeing the mayhem unfold from behind the scenes, Cixi and Ci'an made an unprecedented appearance at court directly criticizing the emperor for his wrongful actions and asked him to withdraw the Edict; Cixi said that "without Prince Gong, the situation today would not exist for you and me."<ref>《清德宗實錄》</ref>  Feeling a grand sense of loss at court and unable to assert his authority, the emperor returned to his former habits. It was rumored that he caught [[syphilis]] and became visibly ill. The doctors spread a rumor that the emperor had caught smallpox, and proceeded to give medical treatment accordingly. Within a few weeks, on 13 January 1875, the emperor died. The Jiashun Empress followed suit in March. Judging from a modern medical perspective, the onset of syphilis comes in stages, thus the emperor's quick death does not seem to reflect its symptoms. Therefore, most historians maintain that Tongzhi did, in fact, die from smallpox. Regardless, by 1875, Cixi was back onto the helm of imperial power.  ==Regency over the Guangxu Emperor==  ===New challenges and illness === [[File:The Qing Dynasty Cixi Imperial Dowager Empress of China with Attendant.JPG|thumb|The Empress Dowager (front middle) poses with her court attendants and the Guangxu Emperor's empress (second from left), who was also her niece]] [[File:慈禧与庆王府四格格.jpg|thumb|The Empress Dowager holds hands with the fourth daughter of Prince Qing (to her left) and chief palace eunuch Li Lianying (to her right). The lady standing in the background is Consort Jin (later Dowager Consort Duankang).]]  Tongzhi died without a male heir, a circumstance that created an unprecedented succession crisis in the dynastic line. Members of the generation above were considered unfit, as they could not, by definition, be the successor of their nephew. Therefore, the new emperor had to be from a generation below or the same generation as Tongzhi. After considerable disagreement between the two dowagers, Zaitian, the first-born of [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]] and Cixi's sister, then aged four, was to become the new emperor. 1875 was declared the era of '''Guangxu''', or the reign of ''Glorious Succession''. Zaitian was taken from his home and for the remainder of his life would be cut completely off from his family. While addressing Ci'an conventionally as ''Huang O'niang'' (Empress Mother), Zaitian was forced to address Cixi as ''Qin Baba'' (親爸爸; lit. "Biological Dad"), in order to enforce an image that she was the fatherly power figure in the house.<ref name="qbb">{{cite web|title=光绪皇帝为什么叫慈禧太后亲爸爸？ Why does the Guangxu Emperor call the Empress Dowager Cixi as Qin Baba?|url=http://www.lsqn.cn/mingren/age/201003/216534.html|publisher=Lishi Qiannian|accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref> The Guangxu Emperor began his education when he was aged five, taught by the imperial tutor Weng Tonghe, with whom he would develop a lasting bond.

Ci'an had taken little interest in running state business, but was the decision maker in most family affairs. As the consort of the Xianfeng Emperor, she took seniority over Cixi, despite being two years her junior. Some believe that rumours began circulating at court to the effect that Cixi had poisoned Ci'an, perhaps as a result of a possible conflict between Cixi and Ci'an over the execution of the grand eunuch [[An Dehai]] in 1869 or a possible will from the late Xianfeng Emperor that was issued exclusively to Ci'an.<ref>Edward Behr, ''The Last Emperor'', 1987, p. 49</ref>  Because of a lack of evidence, however, historians are reluctant to believe that Ci'an was poisoned by Cixi, but instead choose to believe that the cause of death was a sudden [[stroke]], as validated by [[traditional Chinese medicine]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  In the years between 1881 and 1883, Cixi resorted to written communication only with her ministers.<ref>Kwong, pg. 25</ref> The young Guangxu Emperor reportedly was forced to conduct some audiences alone, without Cixi to assist him.<ref name="Kwong, pg. 54">Kwong, pg. 54</ref>  The once fierce and determined Prince Gong, frustrated by Cixi's iron grip on power, did little to question Cixi on state affairs, and supported Manchu involvement in the [[Sino-French War]] of 1884-1885. Cixi used China's loss in the war as a pretext for getting rid of Prince Gong and other important decision makers in the Grand Council in 1885.  She downgraded him to "advisor" and promoted the more easily influenced [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]]. After being appointed President of the Navy, Prince Chun, in a sign of unswerving loyalty to Cixi, but in reality a move to protect his son, the new emperor, moved funds from the military to reconstruct the Imperial Summer Palace outside of Beijing city as a place for Cixi's retirement. Prince Chun did not want Cixi to interfere with the Guangxu Emperor's affairs once he came of age. Cixi showed no opposition to the construction of the palace.  ===The Guangxu Emperor's accession=== The Guangxu Emperor technically gained the right to rule at the age of 16 in 1887 after Cixi issued an edict to arrange a ceremony to mark his accession. Because of her prestige and power, however, court officials voiced their opposition to the Guangxu Emperor's personal rule, citing the emperor's youth as the main reason. Shiduo, Yixuan, and Weng Tonghe, each with a different motive, requested that the Guangxu Emperor's accession be postponed until a later date. Cixi, with her reputed reluctance, accepted the "advice" and legitimized her continued rule through a new legal document that allowed her to "aid" the Guangxu Emperor in his rule indefinitely.  The Guangxu Emperor slowly began to take on more responsibilities in spite of Cixi's prolonged regency. In 1886, he attended his first field plowing ceremony and began commenting on imperial state documents. By 1887, he began to rule under Cixi's supervision.<ref name="Kwong, pg. 54"/>  The Guangxu Emperor married and took up the reins of power in 1889. By that year, the Guangxu Emperor was already 18, older than the conventional marriage age for emperors. Prior to his wedding, a large fire engulfed the Gate of Supreme Harmony at the Forbidden City. This event followed a trend of recent natural disasters that were considered alarming by many observers. According to traditional Chinese political theory, such incidents were taken as a warning of the imminent loss of the "[[Mandate of Heaven]]" by current rulers. [[File:光绪珍妃.jpg|thumb|left|Consort Zhen, the Guangxu Emperor's most beloved consort, was initially liked, but eventually hated by Cixi.]] For his empress, the Empress Dowager Cixi chose the Guangxu Emperor's cousin Jingfen, who would become the [[Empress Longyu]]. Besides her close relation to the emperor himself, she was also Cixi's niece. Cixi in addition selected two concubines for the Guangxu Emperor who were sisters, Consorts [[Consort Jin|Jin]] and [[Consort Zhen|Zhen]]. The Guangxu Emperor eventually would prefer to spend more time with Zhen, neglecting his Empress, much to Cixi's dismay.  In 1894, Cixi degraded Zhen, citing intervention in political affairs as the main reason. According to some reports, she even had her flogged.<ref name="Kwong, pg. 60">Kwong, pg. 60</ref> Jin had also been implicated in Zhen's reported influence peddling and also apparently suffered a similar punishment.<ref name="Kwong, pg. 60"/> A cousin of theirs, an official named Zhi Rui, was banished from the capital to a military outpost.<ref>Kwong, pg. 61</ref>  ==="Retirement" === On March 5, 1889, the dowager empress retired her second regency, but nonetheless served as the effective head of the imperial family.<ref name="Kwong, pg. 29">Kwong, pg. 29</ref>  Many officials felt and showed more loyalty to the dowager empress than they did to the emperor,<ref>Kwong, pg. 38</ref> owing in part to her seniority and in part to her personalized approach to cultivating court favorites, many of whom would be given gifts of her artwork and invitations to join her at the theater for opera and acrobatics.<ref>Kwong, pg. 32</ref>  In spite of her residence for a period of time at the [[Summer Palace|Imperial Summer Palace]], which had been  constructed with the official intention of providing her a suitable place to live after retiring from political affairs, Cixi continued to influence the decisions and actions of the Guangxu Emperor even after he began his formal rule began at age 19. Along with an entourage of court officials, the Guangxu Emperor would pay visits to her every second or third day at which major political decisions would be made. Weng Tonghe observed that while the Guangxu Emperor dealt with day-to-day administration, the Grand Councillors gave their advice in more complex cases, and in the most complex cases of all, the advice of Cixi was sought.<ref>Kwong, pg. 26-27</ref>  In 1894, the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] broke out for control of [[Korea]]. During this period, Cixi was continuously called upon to arbitrate policy-making, and the emperor was sometimes even bypassed in decision-making processes.<ref>Kwong, pg. 27</ref> Cixi eventually was given copies of the secret palace memorials as well, a practice that was carried on until 1898, when it became unnecessary.<ref>Kwong, pg. 27-28</ref>  In November 1895, Cixi celebrated her 60th birthday. Borrowing from the plans used for the celebrations of the 70th and 80th birthdays of the [[Empress Xiaoshengxian]] (mother of the [[Qianlong Emperor]]), plans included a triumphal progress along the decorated road between the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace, decorations for the Beijing city gates and monumental archways, free theatrical performances, remission of punishments and the restoration of degraded officials.<ref>''Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States (1893)'' Denby to Gresham, pg. 240-241; retrieved August 13th, 2013 http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/FRUS.FRUS189394v01</ref> However, the war between China and Japan forced the dowager empress to cancel the lavish celebrations she had planned and settle for a much smaller commemoration that was held in the Forbidden City.  ===Hundred Days' Reform=== After taking power, the Guangxu Emperor became more reform-minded than the conservative-leaning Cixi was comfortable with. After a humiliating defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894, during which China's [[Beiyang]] Navy was crushed by the Japanese forces, the Qing government faced unprecedented challenges internally and abroad, with its very existence at stake. Under the influence of reformers [[Kang Youwei]] and [[Liang Qichao]], the Guangxu Emperor believed that by learning from constitutional monarchies such as [[Japan]] and [[Germany]], China would become more powerful politically and economically. In June 1898, the Guangxu Emperor began the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] (戊戌变法), aimed at a series of sweeping changes politically, legally, and socially. For a brief time, after the supposed retirement of the Empress Dowager Cixi, the Guangxu Emperor issued edicts for a massive number of far-reaching modernizing reforms.  The reforms, however, were too sudden for a China still under significant neo-Confucian influence, and they displeased Cixi, as they served as a serious check on her power. Some government and military officials warned Cixi that the ''ming-shih'' (reformation bureau) had been geared toward conspiracy. Allegations of treason against the emperor, as well as suspected Japanese influence within the reform movement, including a suspicious visit from the former Japanese Prime Minister [[Ito Hirobumi]], led Cixi to resume the role of regent and once again take control of the country.  In another ''[[coup d'etat]]'' carried out by General [[Ronglu]]'s personnel on 21 September 1898, the Guangxu Emperor was taken to Ocean Terrace, a small palace on an island in the middle of [[Zhongnanhai]] linked to the rest of the [[Forbidden City]] only by a controlled causeway. Cixi followed this action with an edict that proclaimed the Guangxu Emperor's total disgrace and unfitness to be emperor. The Guangxu Emperor's reign effectively came to an end.  A crisis followed at the Qing court over the issue of abdication. Bowing to increasing pressure from the West and general civil discontent, Cixi did not forcibly remove the Guangxu Emperor from the throne, although she attempted to have Punji, a boy of fourteen who was from a close branch of the imperial family, installed as [[crown prince]]. The Guangxu era nominally continued until 1908, but the emperor lost all honours, respect, power, and privileges, including his freedom of movement. Most of his supporters, including his former tutor Weng Tonghe and political protege [[Kang Youwei]], were exiled, whereas six prominent reformers led by [[Tan Sitong]] were executed in public on the orders of Cixi. Kang continued to work for a more progressive Qing Empire while in exile, remaining loyal to the Guangxu Emperor and hoping eventually to restore him to power. His efforts would prove to be in vain.  ===Boxer Rebellion === [[File:The Official Audience of Their Majesties.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Empress Dowager Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor holding court. Drawing by [[Katharine Carl]]. ]] [[File:The Qing Dynasty Cixi Imperial Dowager Empress of China On Throne 7.PNG|thumb|Empress Dowager Cixi and women of the American legation. Holding her hand is Sarah Conger, wife of the American minister to China.]] In 1900, the [[Boxer Rebellion]] broke out in northern China. Perhaps fearing further foreign intervention, Cixi threw her support to these anti-foreign bands by making an official announcement of her support for the movement and a formal declaration of war on the European powers. The [[Manchu]] General [[Ronglu]] deliberately sabotaged the performance of the imperial army during the rebellion. [[Dong Fuxiang]]'s Muslim troops (the "[[Kansu Braves]]") were able and eager to destroy the foreign military forces in the legations, but Ronglu stopped them from doing so.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8hiGU_tJEocC&pg=PA54&dq=yangcun+dong+fuxiang&hl=en&ei=KQe2TMCFOsP98AaV29SgCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=ronglu%20not%20boxers%20made%20sure%20siege%20was%20never%20pressed%20home&f=false|title=story in three keys: the boxers as event, experience, and myth|author=Paul A.

After the fall of Beijing, the allied forces negotiated a treaty with the Qing dynasty, sending messengers to the Dowager Empress in Xi'an. Included in the terms of the agreement was a guarantee that China would not have to give up any further territories to foreign powers. Many of the Dowager Empress's advisers in the Imperial Court insisted that the war against the foreigners be continued. They recommended that Dong Fuxiang be given responsibility to continue the war effort. The Dowager was practical, however, and decided that the terms were generous enough for her to acquiesce and stop the war, at least after she was assured of her continued reign when the war was concluded.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iWxKQejMtlMC&pg=PA312&dq=neither+was+china+required+to+surrender+any+territory+Some+members+of+the+exiled+court+had+urged+her+to+continue+the+war,+arguing+that+Peking+and+Tientsin+had+fallen+because+of+traitors,+that+the+allies+could+never+penetrate+the+interior+of+China,+and+that+if+Tung+Fu-hsiang+were+allowed+to&hl=en&ei=eWxxTfvZMNCutweg7dH_Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=neither%20was%20china%20required%20to%20surrender%20any%20territory%20Some%20members%20of%20the%20exiled%20court%20had%20urged%20her%20to%20continue%20the%20war%2C%20arguing%20that%20Peking%20and%20Tientsin%20had%20fallen%20because%20of%20traitors%2C%20that%20the%20allies%20could%20never%20penetrate%20the%20interior%20of%20China%2C%20and%20that%20if%20Tung%20Fu-hsiang%20were%20allowed%20to&f=false|title=The boxer rebellion: the dramatic story of China's war on foreigners that shook the world in the summer of 1900|author=Diana Preston|year=2000|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|location=|page=312|isbn=0-8027-1361-0}}</ref> The Western powers needed a government strong enough to suppress further anti-foreign movements, but too weak to act on its own; they supported the continuation of the Qing, rather than allowing it to be overthrown. Cixi turned once more to [[Li Hongzhang]] to negotiate. Li agreed to sign the [[Boxer Protocol]], which stipulated the presence of an international military force in Beijing and the payment of [[Pound sterling|£]]67&nbsp;million (almost $333&nbsp;million) in [[war reparations]].

High officials were dispatched to Japan and Europe to gather facts and draw up plans for sweeping administrative reforms in law, education, government structure, and social policy, many of which were modeled on the reforms of the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The abolition of the examination system in 1905 was only the most visible of these sweeping reforms. Ironically, Cixi sponsored the implementation of the [[New Policies]], a reform program more radical than the one proposed by the reformers she had beheaded in 1898.<ref>Douglas Reynolds, ''China, 1898–1912: The Xinzheng Revolution and Japan'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1993). ISBN 0-674-11660-7 passim.</ref>  In an attempt to woo the foreigners, she also invited the wives of the diplomatic corps to a tea in the Forbidden City soon after her return, and in time, would hold summer garden parties for the foreign community at the Summer Palace. In 1903, she acquiesced to the request of Sarah Conger, wife of [[Edwin H. Conger|Edwin Conger]], the American minister to China, to have her portrait painted by American artist [[Katharine Carl]] for the [[St. Louis World's Fair]]. Between 1903 and 1905, Cixi had a western educated lady-in-waiting by the name of [[Der Ling]], along with her sister and mother, serve at her court. Der Ling, fluent in English and French, as well as Chinese, often served as translator at meetings with the wives of the diplomatic corps. [[File:The Portrait of the Qing Dynasty Cixi Imperial Dowager Empress of China by an Imperial Painter 4.PNG|thumb|''Empress Dowager Cixi,'' by Katharine Carl, 1904, was given to President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had it added to the [[Smithsonian Museum of American Art]] collections<ref>[http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!274011!0 ''Empress Dowager Cixi''.] Smithsonian Museum of American Art.

More precisely, Empress Dowager Ci'an lies in the Puxiangyu Dingdongling ({{lang|zh-hans|普祥峪定東陵}}) (literally: the "Tomb East of the Dingling Tomb in the Broad Valley of Good Omen"), while Empress Dowager Cixi built herself the much larger Putuoyu Dingdongling ({{lang|zh-hans|菩陀峪定東陵}}) (literally: the "Tomb East of the Dingling Tomb in the Putuo Valley"). The Dingling tomb (literally: the "Tomb of quietude") is the tomb of the Xianfeng Emperor, the spouse of Empress Dowager Ci'an and Empress Dowager Cixi, which is located indeed west of the Ding Dong Ling. The Putuo Valley owes its name to [[Mount Putuo]], one of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains of China]].  Empress Dowager Cixi, unsatisfied with her tomb, ordered its destruction and reconstruction in 1895. The new tomb was a lavish grandiose complex of temples, gates, and pavilions, covered with gold leaf, and with gold and gilded-bronze ornaments hanging from the beams and the eaves. In July 1928, Empress Dowager Cixi's tomb was broken into by warlord and [[Kuomintang]] general [[Sun Dianying]] and his army as part of the [[looting of the Eastern Mausoleum]]. They methodically stripped the complex of its precious ornaments, then dynamited the entrance to the burial chamber, opened Empress Dowager Cixi's coffin, threw her corpse (said to have been found intact) on the floor, and stole all the jewels contained in the coffin, as well as the massive pearl that had been placed in Empress Dowager Cixi's mouth to protect her corpse from decomposing (in accordance with Chinese tradition). Urban legend states that the large pearl on Empress Dowager Cixi's crown was offered by Sun Dianying to Kuomintang leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and ended up as an ornament on the gala shoes of Chiang's wife, [[Soong Mei-ling]], but this is unconfirmed.  After 1949, the complex of Empress Dowager Cixi's tomb was restored by the People's Republic of China, and it is still today one of the most impressive imperial tombs of China.  ==Family== *Paternal great-grandfather **Yehenara Jilang A (葉赫那拉·吉郎阿) *Paternal grandfather **Yehenara Jingrui (葉赫那拉·景瑞) *Father **Yehenara Huizheng (葉赫那拉·惠徵) (29 September 1805 – ?), Manchu official of the Blue Bordered Banner, served in [[Shanxi Province]] before becoming Commissioner of [[Anhui Province|Anhui]] *Mother **Lady Fuca (富察氏), Huizheng's primary wife, daughter of Fuca Huixian (富察·惠顯) *Mate **[[Xianfeng Emperor]], father of the [[Tongzhi Emperor]] *Son **[[Tongzhi Emperor]] * Daughter (by adoption)  ** Princess Rongshou  ===Siblings and their descendants=== [[File:醇亲王福晋合影.jpg|thumb|Cixi's younger sister Yehenara Wanzhen (left) was the principal wife of Prince Chun, and gave birth to the Guangxu Emperor.]]  *1st younger sister: [[Yehenara Wanzhen]] (葉赫那拉·婉貞) (13 September 1841 – 19 June 1896), married [[Yixuan, Prince Chun]] **1st son: Zairong (載瀚) (1 February 1865 – 9 December 1866) **2nd son: Zaitian (載湉) (14 August 1871 – 14 November 1908), became the [[Guangxu Emperor]] **3rd son: unnamed (13 February 1875 – 14 February 1875) **4th son: Zaiguang (載洸) (28 November 1880 – 18 May 1884) *2nd younger sister: Lady Yehenara (葉赫那拉氏), married Yixun (奕勛) (second younger brother of [[Yikuang, Prince Qing]]) *1st younger brother: Yehenara Zhaoxiang (葉赫那拉·照祥) **Son: Yehenara Deshan (葉赫那拉·德善) *2nd younger brother: Yehenara Guixiang (葉赫那拉·桂祥) **1st daughter: Yehenara Jingrong (葉赫那拉·靜榮), married [[Zaize|Zaize, Duke of Zhen]] in 1894 **2nd daughter: Yehenara Jingfen (葉赫那拉·靜芬) (1868 – 22 February 1913), married her first cousin, the [[Guangxu Emperor]] on 26 February 1889 and became [[Empress Dowager Longyu]] (known posthumously as Empress Xiao Ding Jing) **3rd daughter: Yehenara Jingfang (葉赫那拉·靜芳), married [[Zaiyi]] ***Son: Pujun (溥儁) (1885–1942) ****1st son: Yuwei (毓巍) (September 1908 – May 1998) *****1st son: Henglu (恆祿) *****2nd son: Hengyu (恆玉) *****3rd son: Hengjun (恆均) ******Son: Luowei (羅偉) ****2nd son: Yuling (毓嶺) **1st son: Yehenara Deheng (葉赫那拉·德恒), courtesy name Jianting (健亭) ***1st daughter: Yehenara Shumin (葉赫那拉·淑敏) ***2nd daughter: Yehenara Shuqin (葉赫那拉·淑琴) ***Son: Yehenara Enxian (葉赫那拉·恩賢) **2nd son: Yehenara Deqi (葉赫那拉·德祺), courtesy name Shouzhi (壽芝) ***1st daughter: Yehenara Xixian (葉赫那拉·希賢) ***2nd daughter: Yehenara Xiyan (葉赫那拉·希嬿) ***1st son: Yehenara Enyin (葉赫那拉·恩印) ***2nd son: Yehenara Enxian (葉赫那拉·恩顯) ***3rd son: Yehenara {{not a typo|Enmin}} (葉赫那拉·恩民) ***4th son: Yehenara Enzhi (葉赫那拉·恩植) *3rd younger brother: Yehenara Fuxiang (葉赫那拉·福祥) **Son: Yehenara Dekui (葉赫那拉·德奎), courtesy name Wenbo (文伯) ***1st daughter: Yehenara Enhua (葉赫那拉·恩華) ***2nd daughter: Yehenara Enxiu (葉赫那拉·恩秀) ***1st son: Yehenara Enquan (葉赫那拉·恩銓) ***2nd son: Yehenara Enhui (葉赫那拉·恩輝) ***3rd son: Yehenara Enyao (葉赫那拉·恩耀) ***4th son: Yehenara Enguang (葉赫那拉·恩光)  ==Names of Empress Dowager Cixi== [[File:SC-GR-257.jpg|thumb|upright|The plaque hanging above Cixi is inscribed with her title in full]] [[File:Empress Dowager Cixi on the imperial barge on Zhonghai.jpg|thumb|The Empress Dowager was a devoted Buddhist and seized every opportunity to dress up as Avalokiteśvara ([[Kuan Yin]]), the goddess of mercy. This photograph shows her sitting on a barge on Zhonghai. The white smoke forms the character for longevity, and on top of the smoke was her Buddhist name "Guangrenzi" (literally ''Universal Benevolence'').]]  The name by which she is most frequently known and the name used in most modern texts is simply "Cixi", which is neither her birth name nor family name. It is an "honorific name" given to her in 1861 after her son ascended the throne. Empress Dowager Cixi's name at birth is not known, although a recent book published by one of Cixi's brother's descendants seems to suggest that it was ''Xingzhen'' ({{zh|c=杏貞|p=Xìngzhēn|w=Hsingchen}}). The first occurrence of her name is at the time she entered the [[Forbidden City]] in September 1851, where she was recorded as ''"the Lady Yehenara, daughter of Huizheng"'' ({{zh|c=惠徵|p=Huì Zhēng}}). Thus, she was called by her clan's name, the [[Nara (clan)|Yehe-Nara]] clan, as was customary for Manchu girls. On entering the [[Forbidden City]], she was a preparative concubine ({{zh|c=秀女|p=xiù nǚ}}).  After her sexual union with the [[Xianfeng Emperor]], she was made a concubine of the fifth rank ''Noble Person'', a.k.a. "Worthy Lady" ({{zh|c=貴人|p=Guìrén}}), and was given the name Yi ({{zh|c=懿|p=Yì}}, "good, exemplary or virtuous"). Her name was thus "Noble Person of Yi", or ''Worthy Lady Yi'' ({{zh|c=懿貴人|p=Yì Guìrén}}). At the end of December 1854 or the beginning of January 1855, she was promoted to concubine of the fourth rank, ''Imperial Concubine'' ({{zh|c=嬪|p=Pín}}), so that her new name was ''Imperial Concubine Yi'' ({{zh|c=懿嬪|Yì Pín}}).  On 27 April 1856, Yehenara gave birth to a son, the only son of the Xianfeng Emperor, and was immediately made ''Noble Consort Yi"'' ({{zh|c=懿妃|p=Yì Fēi}}). Finally, in February 1857 she was again elevated and made "Noble Imperial Consort Yi" ({{zh|c=懿貴妃|p=Yì Guìfēi}}).  In the end of August 1861, following the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, her five-year-old son became the new Emperor, known as the [[Tongzhi Emperor]]. Empress Dowager Cixi, as biological mother of the new emperor, was officially made ''Divine Mother Empress Dowager'' ({{zh|c=聖母皇太后|p=Shèngmǔ Huáng Tàihòu}}). She was also given the [[honorific name]] Cixi ({{zh|c=慈禧|p=Cíxǐ}}), meaning "Motherly and Auspicious". As for the Empress Consort, she was made ''"Mother Empress Dowager"'' ({{zh|c=母后皇太后|p=Mǔhòu Huáng Tàihòu}}), a title giving her precedence over Empress Dowager Cixi, and she was given the honorific name [[Empress Dowager Ci'an]] ({{zh|c=慈安|p=Cí'ān}})， meaning "Motherly and Calm".  On 7 occasions after 1861, Empress Dowager Cixi was given additional honorific names (two Chinese characters at a time), as was customary for emperors and empresses, until by the end of her reign her name was a long string of 16 characters starting with Cixi (as empress dowager she had the right to nine additions, giving a total of 20 characters, had she lived long enough for it). At the end of her life, her official name was:  * ({{zh|c=大清國當今慈禧端佑康頤昭豫莊誠壽恭欽獻崇熙聖母皇太后|p=Dà qīng guó dāngjīn cíxǐ duān yòu kāngyízhāo yù zhuāng chéngshòu gōng qīn xiàn chóng xī shèngmǔ huáng tàihòu}}) which reads: ''"The Current Divine Mother Empress Dowager Ci-Xi Duan-You Kang-Yi Zhao-Yu Zhuang-Cheng Shou-Gong Qin-Xian Chong-Xi of the Great Qing Empire"''. * The short form was ''The Current Divine Mother Empress Dowager of the Great Qing Empire'' ({{zh|c=大清國當今聖母皇太后|p=Dà qīng guó dāngjīn shèngmǔ huáng tàihòu}})  At the time, Empress Dowager Cixi was addressed as ''"Venerable Buddha"'' ({{zh|c=老佛爺|p=Lǎo Fóyé}})，literally "Master Old Buddha", a term used for all the Emperors of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. At official and ceremonial occasions, the phrase ''Long Live the Empress Dowager for ten thousand years'' ({{zh|c=大清國當今聖母皇太后萬歲萬歲萬萬歲|p=Dà qīng guó dāngjīn shèngmǔ huáng tàihòu wàn suì wàn suì wàn wàn suì}}), which is by convention, only used by emperors. The convention for empress dowagers of imperial China was usually ''Long live for one thousand years''.  At her death in 1908, Empress Dowager Cixi was given a [[posthumous name]] which combines the honorific names that she gained during her lifetime with new names added just after her death. This is the name that is usually used on official documents to refer to an empress. This long form of the posthumous name is:  * ({{zh|c=孝欽慈禧端佑康頤昭豫莊誠壽恭欽獻崇熙配天興聖顯皇太后|p=Xiào qīn cíxǐ duān yòu kāngyízhāo yù zhuāng chéngshòu gōng qīn xiàn chóng xī pèi tiān xìng shèng xiǎn huáng tàihòu}}), which reads: ''Empress Xiao-Qin Ci-Xi Duan-You Kang-Yi Zhao-Yu Zhuang-Cheng Shou-Gong Qin-Xian Chong-Xi Pei-Tian Xing-Sheng Xian''. This long name is still the one that can be seen on Cixi's tomb today. The short form of her posthumous name is: ''Empress Xiao Qin Xian'' ({{zh|c=孝欽顯皇后|p=Xiào Qīn Xiǎn Huánghòu}}).  ==Historical opinions== [[Image:The Portrait of the Qing Dynasty Cixi Imperial Dowager Empress of China in the 1900s.PNG|thumb|upright|One of the historical oil paintings by Western artists depicting Empress Dowager Cixi]]  The dominant historical view of the Empress Dowager Cixi was that of a devious [[Despotism|despot]] who contributed in no small part to China's slide into corruption, anarchy, and revolution. During Cixi's time, she used her power to accumulate vast quantities of money, bullion, antiques and jewelry, using the revenues of the state as her own. However, the most problematic points in Chinese history happened when she was in "retirement" such as when her nephew focused on studying Confucian texts instead of building up the army at the same time that Japan was amassing its navy. When the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] became untenable, Cixi came out of retirement in order to clean up her nephew's shoddy administration. The lavish palaces, gardens and lakes built by Cixi were hugely extravagant at a time when China was verging on bankruptcy.<ref>Edward Behr, ''The Last Emperor'', 1987, p. 51</ref>  ===Katharine Carl=== [[File:Empress Dowager portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Katharine Carl's oil painting of Cixi]] [[Katharine Carl]] spent some ten months with the Empress Dowager Cixi in 1903 to paint her portrait for the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis Exposition]]. Two years later she published a book about her experience, titled ''With the Empress Dowager''. In the book's introduction, Carl says she wrote the book because "After I returned to America, I was constantly seeing in the newspapers (and hearing of) statements ascribed to me which I never made."<ref>''With the Empress Dowager of China'' by Katharine Carl 1907, current print Kessinger Publishing 2004, ISBN 978-1-4179-1701-3.</ref>  In her book, Katharine Carl describes the Empress Dowager Cixi as a kind and considerate woman for her station. Empress Dowager Cixi, though shrewd, had great presence, charm, and graceful movements resulting in "an unusually attractive personality". Carl wrote of the Dowager's love of dogs and of flowers, as well as boating, [[Chinese opera]] and her Chinese water pipes and European cigarettes. Carl also made note of Empress Dowager Cixi's loyalty, describing the case of "a Chinese woman who nursed Her Majesty through a long illness, about twenty-five years since, and saved her life by giving her mother's milk to drink. Her Majesty, who never forgets a favor, has always kept this woman in the Palace. Being a Chinese, she had [[Foot binding|bound feet]]. Her Majesty, who cannot bear to see them even, had her feet unbound and carefully treated, until now she can walk comfortably. Her Majesty has educated the son, who was an infant at the time of her illness, and whose natural nourishment she partook of. This young man is already a Secretary in a good [[yamen]] (government office)."  ===Luke Kwong === Luke Kwong, in his analysis of the Hundred Days of Reform, has argued that many of the allegations of being power-hungry and immoral cannot be verified.<ref name="Kwong, pg. 29"/> He also portrays her as a relatively insecure woman, concerned about her legitimacy and haunted by her relatively humble origins in the palace.<ref>Kwong pg. 31-32</ref> Yet, despite her concerns about her legitimacy, she was not necessarily a power-hungry tyrant who manipulated the court, but was rather content to remain as merely part of a coalition government between herself and the Grand Council, as well as a dynastic figurehead, so long as her sense of legitimacy was respected and unchallenged.<ref>Kwong, pg. 33-34</ref> He also argues that her return to power in 1898 was driven less by Cixi's desire to gain power and opposition to reform, as she had been privy to dispatches from the Grand Council and consulted by the emperor, but that her detachment from court politics<ref name="Kwong, pg. 203">Kwong, pg. 203</ref> and tendency to rely on second-hand accounts had made her subject to manipulation by her informants<ref>Kwong, pg. 35-36</ref> to the point that she felt it urgent<ref name="Kwong, pg. 203"/> to resume her "tutelage" of the emperor.  ===Sterling Seagrave=== Seagrave, argues<ref>''Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China'' by Sterling Seagrave, Vintage Books, New York, 1992 ISBN 0-679-73369-8.</ref> that most of the more sensational stories of Empress Dowager Cixi's life can be traced to the boasting, self-important "Wild Fox" [[Kang Youwei]] and his cronies who, never having met the Empress Dowager, concocted stories of plots and poisonings and passed them on to the Western press. Many other "details" of her life are based on accounts by J. O. P. Bland and known forger [[Sir Edmund Backhouse, 2nd Baronet|Edmund Backhouse]]. As life in the Forbidden City remained a mystery for most Westerners, these stories created by Kang and Backhouse (some up to 30 years after the supposed events) were used by many 20th-century historians to paint a misleading picture of the Empress Dowager.  In contrast, Seagrave portrays Empress Dowager Cixi as a woman stuck between the xenophobic Ironhats faction, made up of Manchu nobility wanting to maintain Manchu dominance and remove Western influences from China at all cost, and more moderate influences trying to cope with China's problems on a more realistic footing, such as Prince Gong in Cixi's earlier days. The Empress Dowager, Seagrave argues, did not crave power but simply acted to balance these influences and protect the Dynasty as best she could.  ===Lei Chia-sheng=== According to research by Professor Lei Chia-sheng (雷家聖),<ref>Lei Chia-sheng雷家聖, ''Liwan kuanglan: Wuxu zhengbian xintan'' 力挽狂瀾：戊戌政變新探 [Containing the furious waves: a new view of the 1898 coup], Taipei: Wanjuan lou 萬卷樓, 2004.</ref> during the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] (戊戌变法), former prime minister of Japan [[Ito Hirobumi|Itō Hirobumi]] (伊藤博文) arrived in China on  11 September 1898. Almost at the same time, British missionary Timothy Richard was invited to Beijing by Kang Youwei. Richard suggested that China should hand over some political power to Itō in order to help push the reforms further.<ref>Timothy Richard, ''Forty-five years in China'', Ch. 12.</ref> On 18 September, Richard convinced Kang Youwei to adopt a plan by which China would join a federation composed of China, Japan, the United States, and England. This suggestion did not reflect the policies of the countries concerned. It was Timothy Richard’s (and perhaps Itō Hirobumi's) trick to convince China to hand over national rights. Kang Youwei nonetheless asked fellow reformers Yang Shenxiu (楊深秀) and Song Bolu (宋伯魯) to report this plan to the Guangxu Emperor.<ref>Kang Youwei 康有為, ''Kang Nanhai ziding nianpu'' 康南海自訂年譜 [Chronicle of Kang Youwei's Life, by Kang Youwei], Taipei: Wenhai chubanshe 文海出版社, p. 67.</ref> On 20 September, Yang sent a memorial to this effect to the Emperor.<ref>Yang Shenxiu, "Shandong dao jiancha yushi Yang Shenxiu zhe" 山東道監察御史楊深秀摺 [Palace memorial by Yang Shenxiu, Investigating Censor of Shandong Circuit], in ''Wuxu bianfa dang'an shiliao'' 戊戌變法檔案史料 [Archival sources on the history of the 1898 reforms], Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1959, p. 15.「臣尤伏願我皇上早定大計，固結英、美、日本三國，勿嫌『合邦』之名之不美。」</ref> In another memorial written the next day, Song Bolu also advocated the formation of a federation and the sharing of the diplomatic, fiscal, and military powers of the four countries under a hundred-man committee.<ref>Song Bolu, "Zhang Shandong dao jiancha yushi Song Bolu zhe" 掌山東道監察御史宋伯魯摺 [Palace memorial by Song Bolu, Investigating Censor in charge of the Shandong Circuit], in ''Wuxu bianfa dang'an shiliao'', p. 170.「渠(李提摩太)之來也，擬聯合中國、日本、美國及英國為合邦，共選通達時務、曉暢各國掌故者百人，專理四國兵政稅則及一切外交等事。」</ref>  Still according to Lei Chia-sheng's findings, on 13 October, British ambassador Sir C. MacDonald reported to his government about the Chinese situation, saying that Chinese reforms had been damaged by Kang Youwei and his friends’ actions.<ref>''Correspondence Respecting the Affairs of China, Presented to Both Houses of Parliament by Command of Her Majesty'' (London, 1899.3), No. 401., p .303.</ref> British diplomat Baurne claimed in his own report that Kang was a dreamer who had been seduced by Timothy Richard’s sweet words. Baurne thought Richard was a plotter.<ref>''British Foreign Office files (F.O.)'' 17/1718,  26 September 1898.</ref> The British and American governments were unaware of the "federation" plot, which seems to have been Timothy Richard’s personal idea. Because Richard's partner Itō Hirobumi had been Prime Minister of Japan, the Japanese government might have known about Richard's plan, but there is no evidence to this effect.  ===Princess Der Ling=== [[Der Ling]], whose Christian name was Elisabeth Antoinette, was born in Beijing in June 1885 and died in Berkeley, California in November 1944.  She was the eldest daughter of Yu Keng, an official of the Chinese-Martial (Han Jun) Plain White Banner, and his wife, Louisa Pierson, daughter of an American merchant in Shanghai and his Chinese consort.  When Der Ling's father was recalled from Paris, where he had been a Chinese minister, in 1903, Der Ling, her sister Rong Ling (later the wife of General Dan Paochao) and their mother were summoned by Cixi to become court ladies – something between ladies-in-waiting and translators/hostesses for when the Empress Dowager had foreign female guests from Beijing's Legation Quarter.  Der Ling served at court from March 1903 till October 1905, and married an American, Thaddeus Cohu White, in 1907.  After Cixi's death in 1908, Der Ling professed to be so angered by what she saw as false portraits of Cixi appearing in books and periodicals that she wrote her own account of serving "Old Buddha", which she called "Two Years in the Forbidden City".  This book appeared in 1911, just before the fall of the Qing Dynasty, and was a popular success.  In this book, Cixi is not the monster of depravity depicted in the popular press and in the second and third hand accounts left by foreigners who had lived in Beijing, but an aging woman who loved beautiful things, had many regrets about the past and the way she had dealt with the many crises of her long reign, and apparently trusted Der Ling enough to share many memories and opinions with her.  It was clearly Cixi's favouritism toward Der Ling, including permitting her to wear a "princess button" on her hat, that prompted Der Ling in later years, when seeking an English equivalent to her office at court, to add "Princess" to her name, a move that undermined her credibility in China even as it drove up her stock when she went before the American public in the 1920s to give lectures about life at court with the semi-legendary Cixi.  Der Ling ultimately wrote a full-length biography of Cixi titled 'Old Buddha.'  Der Ling would go on to write seven more books about this relatively brief period in her youth when she had been close to the centre of failing imperial Chinese power, and sharing this personal history and her habit of promoting herself and her writings caused most of her family to turn against her. All of this has made it difficult to assess Der Ling's contribution to late Qing historiography.  But the fact remains that she was the first woman of Cixi's own ethnic background to live with and observe her and then write about what it was like; if many of Der Ling's recollections smack of the every day minutiae of a court that thrived on details and form, her writings are no less valuable for focusing on them, particularly as life within the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace was a closed book for most people in China, let alone in the rest of the world.  It was misunderstanding of much of what emanated from the throne that created so many of the problems Cixi has been wholly blamed for.  Starting with Sterling Seagrave's biography of Cixi, 'Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China', Der Ling and her reminiscence of the imperial court have been rehabilitated in recent years, in tandem with reassessments of the Empress Dowager herself.  In January 2008, Hong Kong University Press published the first biography of Der Ling, 'Imperial Masquerade: The Legend of Princess Der Ling'.<ref>Imperial Masquerade: The Legend of Princess Der Ling, by Grant Hayter-Menzies [ISBN 978-962-209-881-7], Hong Kong University Press, January 2008</ref>  ===Jung Chang=== In 2013, Jung Chang's biography of the empress dowager, ''[[Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China]]'', set out to correct the negative history. Chang portrays Cixi as the most capable ruler and administrator that China could have had at the time. Katie Baker wrote in [[The Daily Beast]] "There have indeed been many judgments passed on Cixi's legacy, from the rumors (possibly spread by Wild Kang) that she was a sexually voracious despot to Chang’s final pronouncement that "the past hundred years have been most unfair to Cixi" and that "the political forces that have dominated China since soon after her death have also deliberately reviled her or blacked out her accomplishments…[but] in terms of groundbreaking achievements, political sincerity and personal courage, Empress Dowager Cixi set a standard that has barely been matched." <ref name="thedailybeast.com">http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/10/30/empress-dowager-cixi-the-woman-who-made-china-modern.html</ref> Historian [[Pamela Crossley]], however, cautions that Chang Jung "does not merely repeat what are now truisms in the representation of Cixi – that she has been obscured by misogyny and orientalist stereotyping, as well as the anti-Manchu sentiment running through Chinese nationalist narratives – but also claims to have discovered something new." Crossley says that these claims regarding Cixi's importance "seem to be minted from her own musings, and have little to do with what was actually going on in China." She faults the book for crediting Cixi with powers that were in fact held elsewhere.<ref>"[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0By7Ajg4xYgVqYklQR296bl9lOGs/edit In the Hornet's Nest]," ''London Review of Books'' April 9, 2014</ref>  ===Other sources=== Cixi appears frequently in ceremonies described in the diaries of [[Sir Ernest Satow]] for 1900–06 when Satow was British envoy in Peking.  Another well known but now widely questioned biography is "China Under The Empress Dowager" by J. O. P. Bland and [[Sir Edmund Backhouse, 2nd Baronet|Edmund Backhouse]]. Backhouse was later found to have forged some of his source materials when he wrote this work. This is a book that gave rise to much of the negative perspective of the dowager empress.<ref>H. R.
