   William Worth Belknap (September 22, 1829 &ndash; October 12, 1890) was a United States Army Major General, government administrator in Iowa, and United States Secretary of War.  Although Belknap served with distinction in the Civil War, his tenure as President Grant's Secretary of War was controversial, for having indirectly sold weapons to France and for accepting illicit kickbacks in exchange for making a tradership appointment. The latter led to his resignation, impeachment by the House, and trial in the Senate during the summer of 1876. Belknap, a native of New York, graduated from Princeton college in 1848, studied law at Georgetown University, and passed the bar in 1851. Belknap moved to Iowa and started a law practice and partnership.  Belknap entered politics as a Democrat and was elected Representative in Iowa legislature in 1857.  When the Civil War broke out in spring 1861, Belknap joined Union Army and was eventually promoted Brevet Maj. General in 1865 for his gallantry during Maj. Gen. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign earlier in 1864. In hand-to-hand combat at Atlanta, Belknap crossed an entrenchment, captured the Confederate commander, and physically dragged him over to the Union side.  Belknap was appointed Iowa Collector of Internal Revenue by President Andrew Johnson and served four years. In 1869, President Grant appointed Belknap Secretary of War. As secretary, Belknap requisitioned portrait paintings by various artists for previous Secretaries of War to be displayed in honor of the United States Centennial. He also aided Chicago Fire victims in 1871 and pardoned James Webster Smith, America's first African American cadet at West Point. During the Reconstruction Era, Belknap's War Department and the U.S. military worked under supervision of President Ulysses S. Grant and the U.S. Attorney General's office to vigorously enforce the mandates of this policy upon the defeated South. In 1875, Belknap and President Grant secretly agreed to remove troops from the Black Hills after gold was discovered, in order to start an Indian War after Sioux Indians refused to sell their lands. Belknap was the only former Cabinet secretary ever to have been impeached by the House of Representatives. A Congressional investigation in 1876 revealed that Belknap had received kickback payments in return for a lucrative contract. Starting in 1870, having authority by Congress to appoint trader ships, Belknap took graft money to support his wives and live a lavish lifestyle in Washington D.C.  Belknap resigned his position as Secretary of War shortly before being impeached by the House. President Grant had accepted his resignation before the House voted on Belknap's impeachment, later that same day.  Belknap was tried in the Senate, but was acquitted when the vote for conviction failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority. A significant number of Senators believed that the Senate did not have jurisdiction to put a private citizen on trial.  Belknap, with his reputation damaged, returned to his law practice until his death in 1890. Historically Belknap is noted for being a man of virtues and flaws. He was noted for his bravery during the Civil War, but while Secretary of War he undermined  the military careers of William T. Sherman and Oliver Otis Howard.  Belknap and his wives were supported by graft to live a lavish lifestyle in Washington D.C. at the expense of soldiers and Indians. However, Belknap was noted for his preservation of Mathew Brady's photographic history of the American Civil War and for starting the weather bureau. Belknap was born on September 22, 1829 in Newburgh, New York to career soldier William G. Belknap, who had fought with distinction in the War of 1812 and the Mexican American War.New York Times (October 14, 1890), Belknap's Sudden Death His mother was Anne Clark Belknap.Dictionary of American Biography (1936), William Worth Belknap In 1848, Belknap graduated from Princeton University. After graduation Belknap studied law at Georgetown University. In 1851, he was admitted to the bar, moved to Keokuk, Iowa, and entered into a law partnership with Ralph B. Low. He served in the Iowa House of Representatives as a Democrat for a single term from 1857 to 1858.Iowa General Assembly-William Worth Belknap Belknap was married three times. The first was in 1854 to Cora LeRoy who died in 1862.Koster (2010), pp. 59-60.  Belknap remarried to Carita S. Tomlinson from Kentucky in January, 1869. Carita, however, died of tuberculosis shortly after childbirth in December, 1870.  Belknap remarried a third and final time on December 11, 1873 to Amanda Tomlinson Bower, widow of John Bower and Carita's sister. Belknap was the father of Hugh R. Belknap, U.S. Representative from Illinois. With his third wife he had one daughter, Alice Belknap, born November 28, 1874. http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wwbelkna.htmhttps://books.google.co.il/books?id=WVJKAAAAYAAJ&q=%22alice+belknap%22+marriage&dq=%22alice+belknap%22+marriage&hl=iw&sa=X&redir_esc=yhttps://books.google.co.il/books?id=qKQKhVMFUAwC&pg=PA287&dq=%22alice+belknap%22+marriage&hl=iw&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22alice%20belknap%22%20marriage&f=false She was considered one of Washington society's most sought after belles.

Belknap and the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry were finally mustered into military action.  Traveling by steamer from St. Louis, Belknap was sent to the front at the Battle of Shiloh; arriving at Pittsburgh Landing on April 6 serving under the Army of the Tennessee. Belknap and his men were ordered to the front to serve under Maj. Gen Benjamin M. Prentiss at the Hornet's Nest. Belknap and his raw 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry troops were forced to fight like regular army veterans on Prentiss depleted line. Belknap fought bravely, was slightly wounded, and his horse was shot and killed from under him. After Shiloh, Belknap served as acting commander of the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry at the Battle of Corinth. Col. Hugh T. Reid, commander of the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry, had been severely injured in the neck at Shiloh and removed from active duty.Belknap-Tyler (1887), p. 609 Col. Reid stated that at Shiloh Belknap, "was always in the right place at the right time, directing and encouraging officers and men as coolly as a veteran" At Corinth, Belknap was noted for his "conspicuous gallantry". After Corinth,  Belknap and the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry for a time served on guard duty. Belknap was formerly promoted from Major to Lieutenant Colonel on August 20, 1862.  Belknap was promoted from Lieutenant Colonel to Colonel of the Iowa 15th Volunteer Infantry on June 3, 1863. Belknap's primary military operation took place at the Siege of Vicksburg until July 4, 1863. On December 24, 1863 Belknap was in command of the 11th Iowa Volunteer Infantry and the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry reinforcing Redbone, Mississippi, south of Vicksburg. On February 26, 1864 Belknap served as Provost Marshall of Post  in Canton, Mississippi.  On June 8, 1864 Col. Belknap and the veteran 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry were transferred to the 4th Division, XVII Corps at Ackworth, Georgia. On July 22, 1864 at the Battle of Atlanta, Belknap served with distinction, having broken through Confederate breastworks. Vigorously fighting in hand-to-hand combat, Col. Belknap crossed the breastworks, physically captured Confederate Col. Harris D. Lampley, 45th Alabama Infantry, dragged him over to the Union line, and took him as prisoner.Belknap-Tyler (1887), p. 24 On July 28, 1864 Col. Belknap was in charge of the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry and the 32nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry having reinforced Maj. Gen. R.L. Smith's XV Corps. On July 30, Belknap was promoted to Brigadier General and given command of the 4th Division, XVII Corps, and participated in Major Gen. Sherman's operations in Georgia and the Carolinas.  After Atlanta was taken by the Union Army, Belknap accompanied Maj. Gen. Sherman on his March to the Sea. Belknap was promoted Brevet Major General on March 13, 1865 as a reward for his bravery in the Atlanta Campaign. On August 24, 1865, Brevet Maj. Gen Belknap was mustered out of the U.S. Army. In 1865, after the American Civil War had ended, President Andrew Johnson appointed Belknap, now retired from military service, to the post of Iowa Collector of Internal Revenue. In that position, Belknap was responsible for collecting millions of dollars in federal taxes.Koster (2010), p. 59  Belknap served in that position for four years, until he was appointed Secretary of War by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. During his term as Collector, Belknap associated himself with the Republican Party in the period of Reconstruction.  On the advice of General of the Army William T. Sherman, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Belknap to Secretary of War on October 25, 1869, to take the place of Sec. John A. Rawlins who had died in office earlier of tuberculosis.Smith (2001), pp. 542-543  Belknap at that time was a protégé of Sherman's, having fought in the Atlanta Campaign and accompanied him on Sherman's March to the Sea. President Grant believed Belknap had served capably during the American Civil War and deserved to head the War Department. After his appointment, Sec. Belknap imposed or recommended several positive initiatives. He recommended that Congress act to fix the date of May 1 as the start of the fiscal year. He inaugurated the preparation of historical reports by post commanders, and proposed actions to preserve Yellowstone National Park.Bell (1981), p. 78 Not all of Sec. Belknap's actions were well received, however. He initiated a protocol that bypassed and weakened the authority of General of the Army Sherman. Subsequently, in 1874, Sherman left Washington D.C. and moved his headquarters to St. Louis.Donovan (2008), pp. 104-105 Major General Oliver O. Howard was also ostracized by Sec. Belknap. While stationed in Oregon, in 1874, Major General Howard candidly expressed his opinion of Sec. Belknap. Howard stated that Belknap was deceptive to "General Grant", that Belknap was not a true Republican, and that he associated nightly with "foul-mouthed" Democratic Kentucky associates. Howard also opined that Belknap was "not in favor" of the President's Indian Peace policy.Simon ( 2003), The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant, Vol. 5, 1874 That statement is likely related to a conflict, during Sec. Belknap's tenure, between the U.S. War Department and the U.S. Department of Interior as to which Department would control the destiny of American Indians. In the context of this era, Belknap's actions may not be seen as overtly aggressive or overreaching.  In terms of Reconstruction, historian Jean Edward Smith, notes that Grant, former General of the Army, supervised the use of the U.S. military and that Belknap "had less freedom of action then other cabinet members."Smith (2001), p. 543 Upon assuming office in 1869, Sec. Belknap conceived an idea to make a series of portraits of previous civilian heads of the War Department in honor of the then upcoming 1876 U.S. Centennial.Bell (1981), p. 8  Sec. Belknap hired renowned artists Daniel Huntington, Robert Weir, and Henry Ulke and had them paint portraits of the long list of his predecessors in the War Department. Sec. Belknap's own portrait was painted by Daniel Huntington in 1874. The Secretary of War portraits were then assembled into a distinct collection to be viewed by the public.  The portrait painting of the Secretary of War was continued by Sec. Belknap's successors. In addition to secretaries, portraits were made of other persons notable for their war conduct distinction. Sec. Belknap has been given "unqualified credit" for his creation of the War Department gallery in Washington D.C.  In 1870, Sec. Belknap lobbied Congress, and on July 15 was granted the sole power to appoint and license sutlers with ownership rights to highly lucrative "traderships" at U.S. military forts in the Western frontier.Koster (2010), p. 59Forty First Congress, Statutes At Large, pp. 319-320 The power to appoint traderships by the Commanding General of the Army, at that time being William T. Sherman, was repealed. Having been granted the sole power to appoint traderships, Sec. Belknap further empowered those traderships with a virtual monopoly. Soldiers stationed at forts with Belknap appointed sutlers could only buy supplies through the authorized tradership.  These monopoly traderships were considered good investments during the Gilded Age.Koster, p. 59-60  Soldiers on the Western frontier, who were thus forced to buy supplies at higher than market prices, were left destitute as a result.Koster pp. 58-59 Hostile American Indians bought supplies at these traderships, including high-quality breech-loaders and repeating rifles.Koster, p. 58  Soldiers, however, were requisitioned by Sec. Belknap's War Department inferior breech-loaders that jammed on the third round.  The policy affected the firepower of the U.S. troops and may have contributed to the defeat of Col. Custer and the 7th Cavalry at Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876. Custer, however, had refused for unclear reasons to bring Gatling guns with the ability to shoot 150 rounds per minute, that would have strongly increased his regimental fire power.Hofling (1981), p. 30 In 1870, Sec. Belknap's second wife, Carita, successfully lobbied her husband to appoint a New York contractor (Caleb P. Marsh) to a trader post at Fort Sill located in the Indian Territory.McFeely (1981), p. 58  John S. Evans, however, had already been appointed to that position.  To settle the question of ownership, regarding the tradership, an illicit partnership contract, authorized by Sec. Belknap, was drawn. The contract allowed Evans to keep the tradership at Fort Sill, provided that he pay $12,000 of the annual profits to Marsh. Evans would be allowed to keep the remaining profits. Marsh, in turn, was required to split half of his receipts from the contract, $6,000 per year, with Carita. However, Carita only received one payment before her death (tuberculosis after childbirth) in 1870. After Carita's death, Marsh continued to pay Sec. Belknap Carita's share of the profits, for the benefit of her child. Although the child died in 1871, Sec. Belknap continued to accept quarterly kickback payments from Marsh.  When Sec. Belknap remarried, to Carita's sister, Amanda, both Sec. Belknap and Amanda continued to accept the quarterly payments from Marsh. During the Franco-Prussian War that lasted from 1870 to 1871, the United States declared neutrality.McFeely (1981), pp. 150-151  Sec. Belknap had been criticized and accused by Grant Administration critics, Charles Sumner and Carl Schurz, for violating neutrality and selling arms to French agents. Sec. Belknap sold obsolete U.S. War Department firearms to a neighbor of the Remington family. Samuel Remington, as arms-selling agent to the French Government, subsequently arranged the sale of those firearms to France.Doukas (2003), p. 80  Sec. Belknap subsequently sold 54,000,000 cartridges to the French Army that would specifically fit the firearms he had previously sold to the Remington neighbor. A Congressional investigation which took place in 1872 exonerated Sec. Belknap, and no criminal charges for impeachment were initiated.  During the Reconstruction Era, in 1870, former slave James Webster Smith, through private sponsorship, became the first African American cadet to enroll at West Point.McFeely (1981), p. 375 Smith, however, was immediately and severely hazed by white cadets. It is believed that the Academy's military establishment was determined to force Smith out.McFeely (1981), pp. 375-376. One of Sec. Belknap's nephews, a cadet at the Academy, had been reprimanded (but not otherwise punished) for hazing Smith.McFeely (1981), p. 377 In one instance, Smith was arrested and taken to a military court for fighting a white cadet. However, Major General Oliver O. Howard, an advocate for African American civil rights and in charge of the trial, acquitted Smith of all charges and gave him a light punishment for unruly conduct.McFeely (1981), pp. 377-378 This outraged the Academy's Bureau of Military Justice, who made a formal protest to Belknap on November 20, 1870.McFeely (1981), p. 378 In a second instance in January 1871, Smith was arrested again for not holding his head up when marching, after being severely harassed by white cadets. This time Smith was convicted and his case was appealed to  Belknap. Smith was pardoned by Belknap and allowed to return to West Point as a plebe. In 1874, Smith continued at West Point, until, Prof. Peter S. Michie, a white supremacist, gave Smith a private test, in defiance of traditional West Point practice.McFeely (1981), p. 379 Smith was forced out of West Point after having failed the test and was denied a retest by Michie. Ironically, Belknap believed Smith had been shown more favor than white cadets at West Point. Major General Thomas H. Ruger, appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871, reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the "discreditable" practice.New York Times (August 23, 1873), The Military Academy Report of the Board of West Point Visitors Belknap admired Ruger's performance as West Point Superintendent and stated, "I am pretty satisfied with the success of your management, and private conversations with officers of all grades, & with civilians too, who have been there since your accession..."Cowan's (June 24, 2009), West Point Superintendent Thomas H.

Flipper  Smith was finally commissioned an officer by West Point in 1997, one hundred and twenty three years later.Reading Eagle, Armies First Black Cadet Gets Bars 123 Years Later, p. A13   From October 8, 1871 to October 10 a devastating fire burned and destroyed much of Chicago. The fire killed hundreds of people and caused $200,000,000 in damages. Over 100,000 citizens were left destitute and homeless.New York Times (October 11, 1871), The Ruined City Sec. Belknap, concerned for the victims, promptly took action on October 9 and sent food rations from St. Louis, tents from Jeffersonville for the many homeless persons, and two company troops from the Omaha infantry to keep peace and order. On October 10, Sec. Belknap in writing a dispatch to Lt. General Philip Sheridan stated that the fire was "...a national calamity. The sufferers have the sincere sympathy of the nation." Sec. Belknap ordered military officers around the nation to send supplies to Chicago "liberally and promptly". Louisiana during Reconstruction was one of the most politically turbulent and disputed states. Rival political factions fought for power in the state government, requiring the deployment of federal troops to keep peace.Coakley (1988), pp. 316-317  During January 1872, the War Department was kept on high alert, concerned with the potential for violent confrontation, in New Orleans, between Gov. Henry Clay Warmoth's  faction and former speaker of the Louisiana House, George W. Carter's faction.Coakley (1988), pp. 317-318 To prevent disorder Major General William H. Emory, Louisville District Commander, in charge of New Orleans, decided that federal troops were needed to prevent violence.Dawson (1982), pp. 117-118 Belknap at the War Department informed General in Chief William T. Sherman and supported Emory's request for the use of federal troops.  On January 5,   federal troops were deployed in New Orlean to prevent violence until the 11th.Coakley (1988), pp. 318-319 Sec. Belknap advised President Grant that Emory was the best man on the scene to make the decision to use military force.  On the 9th a riot broke out after a Gov. Warmoth supporter was assassinated; Gov. Warmoth's state police retaliated by attacking and dispersing Carter's faction at the Gem Saloon; Emory deployed reinforcement troops on the 10th to restore order.Coakley (1988), p. 319  On January 12, Grant, wanting to stay out of state politics, told the mayor of New Orleans through the War Department that martial law would not be declared in Louisiana. An angry mob of thousands of Carter's men took to the streets. Emory deployed troops equipped with Gatling guns.Coakley (1988), pp. 319-320 Carter's men dispersed knowing Emory would use U.S. military force to keep the peace. On January 15, Grant wrote to Belknap that he desired to prevent the "danger of bloodshed" without having to take sides with any two factions.Coakley (1988), p. 320  On January 16, Att. Gen. George H. Williams told Gov. Warmoth, that Grant would only take sides if there was a "clear case of legal right and overruling necessity."  On January 22,  as both Gov. Warmoth and Carter formed rival militias and the two were ready for war, President Grant issued orders through the War Department for Emory to use troops if necessary.Coakley (1988), pp. 321-322  When Emory communicated Grant's message to both Gov. Warmoth and Carter, the two rival factions dispersed and a 10-month peace was kept.  In 1873, the construction of the America's first steel arched bridge, named after James B. Eads, was nearing completion in St. Louis.Stevens (2008), pp. 99-100 Belknap, under influence from the Keokuk Packet steamliner company, was opposed to its completion. He desired the bridge torn down, so steamers would not have to lower their smoke stacks to go under the bridge.  Sec. Belknap created a commission to either destroy the bridge, or to build a canal around the bridge for steamers to pass.  Eads, who was friends with Grant, visited Washington D.C. in November 1873 before Belknap submitted the report to Congress, and asked that Grant rescue the bridge from destruction.Stevens (2008), pp. 100-101  Belknap stated he had the authority to keep the rivers from being obstructed according to federal law. President Grant reminded Belknap that Congress had authorized the construction of the bridge. President Grant was convinced that Congress would not authorize money to tear the bridge down, overruled Belknap's decision, and told Belknap in person "You certainly cannot destroy this structure on your own authority...General, you had better drop this case." Stevens (2008), pp. 101-102 Belknap was embarrassed, stood up blushing, bowed to President Grant, and left the meeting. The Eads Bridge was completed in 1874 and is still in active use today.Eads Bridge infosite, en.structurae.de; accessed June 19, 2015.  During the summer of 1875, Sec. Belknap decided to explore Yellowstone the nation's first national park, signed into law by President Grant on March 2, 1872.Scott (2007), p. 105 Accompanying Sec. Belknap were Col. Randolph B. Marcy, Lt. Col. James W. Forsyth, and Chicago businessman William E. Strong. Leading the expedition was Lt. Gustavus C. Doane, who had led the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition in 1870, the first extensive federal survey of the Yellowstone territory, that was responsible in part for the formation of Yosemite National Park.Cambell (1909) , p. 72 Lt. Doane left Fort Ellis, where he was stationed, and made preparations for Sec. Belknap's party arrival at Mammoth Hot Springs.Scott (2007), pp. 105-106 On July 26, Sec. Belknap's party reached Fort Ellis and proceeded to meet Lt. Doane at Mammoth Hot Springs.  Led by Lt. Doane, Belknap's party attempted to retrace the original 1870 Expedition in addition to hunting for any big game found on the journey. Sec. Belknap's party included 24 soldiers and two ambulances.Scott (2007), p. 106 The two-week expedition proved to be troublesome as Lt. Doane was unable to find big game to hunt and after briefly viewing the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone Sec. Belknap's party had to wait several hours before Lt. Doane finally found the trail.Scott (2007), pp. 106-107  In late July 1874 a U.S. Army expedition under Col. George A. Custer discovered gold in the Black Hills.Jeffrey Ostler (2004) The Plains Sioux and U.S. Colonialism from Lewis and Clark to Wounded Knee, pp 60-62 Soon many miners trespassed on Indian land under the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie to mine for gold. In June 1875, President Grant attempted to resolve the problem by offering Indians $100,000 per year to lease their land or $6,000,000 for the Black Hills. The Lakota Sioux under Chief Red Cloud refused since the offer would require the Sioux to be moved to the Indian Territory in Oklahoma. On November 3, 1875, as the crisis escalated, President Grant held a secret meeting at the White House including Belknap and Secretary of Interior Zachariah Chandler. Grant, Belknap, and Chandler agreed to a plan that would withdraw U.S. troops from the Black Hills, allowing miners to mine on Indian Territory. The purpose of troop withdrawal was to start an Indian War. On December 3, 1875 Chandler ordered all Indians to return to their respected reservations, however, militant Indians under Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse refused to return. By January 1876 4,000 miners illegally occupied Indian land. When hostile Indians refused to leave their hunting grounds by the January 31 deadline, Chandler turned the Indians over to Belknap's War Department stating "the said Indians are hereby turned over to the War Department for such action on the part of the Army as you [Belknap] may deem proper under the circumstances."Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of War, February 1, 1876, National Archives On February 8, 1876 Generals Crook and Terry were ordered to start winter military campaigns against hostile Indians and the Great Sioux War commenced.Colonel Drum to Gen. Terry and Gen. Crook, February 8, 1876, National Archives On March 1, 1876 Crook, in freezing weather, marched north from Fort Fetterman near Douglas, Wyoming to attack Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and their Indian followers on the Powder River.Collins, Jr., Charles D. Atlas of the Sioux Wars, Second edition, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas: Combat Studies Institute Press, 2006, Map 14, 15 The following day, March 2, Belknap ubruptly resigned office over the Fort Sill traderpost scandal. From March 3 to March 7 the War Department was run under Grant's appointed Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson. On March 8, 1876 Alphonso Taft was appointed by Grant Secretary of War. The Great Sioux War ended in April 1877 under President Rutherford B. Hayes.   On February 29, 1876, during the Great Sioux War, upon rumors that Belknap was receiving profits from traderships, Representative Hiester Clymer launched an investigation into the War Department.McFeely (1981), pp. 151-152 Although Clymer and Belknap were friends, Clymer was an extreme partisan Democrat who strongly opposed Republican Reconstruction. Caleb P. Marsh testified that Belknap had personally taken Fort Sill tradership profit payments in exchange for a tradership partnership agreement between Marsh and Fort Sill sutler John S. Evans.  On March 1, Belknap and his counsel went before Clymer's committee, however, Belknap declined to testify.  In a White House meeting on March 2, Belknap appeared before President Grant, who asked for Belknap's resignation. Earlier that morning, Treasury Secretary Benjamin Bristow had told President Grant of Belknap's impending impeachment. President Grant accepted Belknap's resignation at 10:20 A.M.  Clymer's committee was informed of Belknap's resignation at 11:00 A.M.  Although Belknap's resignation caused great commotion among House members, it did not forestall action by the Clymer committee. The committee unanimously passed resolutions to impeach Belknap and drew up five articles of impeachment to be sent to the Senate. Belknap, by then a private citizen, was impeached by a unanimous vote of the House of Representatives.Hinds (1907), section 2444, pp. 903-904. Speaker of the House Michael C. Kerr wrote to the Senate that Belknap resigned "with intent to evade the proceedings of impeachment against him."Hinds (1907), section 2454, p. 922. Belknap's case was constitutionally unprecedented and would serve as reference for nine other civilian officials resignations before trial, including President Richard Nixon.Woldow (Feb. 2004), Vermont Law Library Newsletter Belknap was tried by the Senate, which ruled by a vote of 37-29 that it had jurisdiction despite the resignation.Hinds (1907), section 2459, p. 934. However, Belknap was subsequently acquitted of the charges when the vote for conviction fell short of the required two-thirds majority.McFeely (1974), p. 152 Twenty-three of the senators who voted for Belknap's acquittal believed that the Senate did not have jurisdiction. Grant's speedy acceptance of Belknap's resignation undoutedly saved Belknap from conviction. Grant replaced Belknap with Alphonso Taft as Secretary of War.
