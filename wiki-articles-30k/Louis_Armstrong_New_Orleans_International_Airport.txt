   Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport  () is an international airport in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is owned by the city of New Orleans and is 11 miles west of downtown New Orleans., effective March 10, 2011. The airport's address is 900 Airline Drive in Kenner, Louisiana. A small portion of Runway 11/29 is in unincorporated St. Charles Parish. Armstrong International is the primary commercial airport for the New Orleans metropolitan area and southeast Louisiana. The airport was formerly known as Moisant Field, and it is also known as Louis Armstrong International Airport and New Orleans International Airport. Despite its status as an international airport, the majority of commercial flights offered are to domestic destinations within the United States. During the 1960s through the 1990s and prior to Hurricane Katrina, numerous international flights were available. The current international scheduled passenger service destinations are Toronto, Canada; Panama City, Panama; Cancun, Mexico; and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic (with the latter destination only being offered seasonally). The airport is aggressively working to restore more international destinations. At an average of  above sea level, MSY is the 2nd lowest-lying international airport in the world, behind only Amsterdam's Schiphol International Airport in the Netherlands, which is eleven feet below sea level. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, MSY served 9.7 million passengers per year, nearly all of them non-connecting. In 2015 it served 10,673,301 passengers, 9.1% more than 2014.[ ] Airport Sets Passenger Record Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was once a major gateway for Latin American and Caribbean travel to and from the United States. That travel now mostly goes through other hubs operated by major legacy airlines such as the American Airlines hubs in Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) and Miami (MIA), the Delta Air Lines hub in Atlanta (ATL), and the United Airlines hub in Houston (IAH). MSY opened after World War II, replacing the older New Orleans Lakefront Airport (which kept the NEW and KNEW airport codes and now serves general aviation) as the city's main airport. MSY was renamed in 2001 after Louis Armstrong, a famous jazz musician from New Orleans.  The National Weather Service forecast office for the area was once located at MSY, but has moved to the suburb of Slidell, and now uses the non-airport codes LIX and KLIX. In January 2016, the airport will begin replacement of the current terminal by starting construction on a new terminal located on the north side of the airfield. The terminal is slated to have 30 gates (the current terminal rents out 22), which can be expanded to 42 gates in the future.  Plans for a new airport began in 1940, as evidence mounted that the older Shushan Airport (New Orleans Lakefront Airport) was too small. The airport was originally named Moisant Field after daredevil aviator John Moisant, who died in 1910 in an airplane crash on agricultural land where the airport is now located. Its IATA code MSY was derived from Moisant Stock Yards, as Lakefront Airport retained the "NEW" code.Welcome to the Best of New Orleans! Blake Pontchartrain March 29, 2005 In World War II the land became a government air base. It returned to civil control after the war and commercial service began at Moisant Field in May 1946. On September 19, 1947 the airport was shut down as it was submerged under two feet of water in the wake of the 1947 Hurricane's impact. When commercial service began at Moisant Field in 1946, the terminal was a large, makeshift hangar-like building—a sharp contrast to airports in then-peer cities.  A new terminal complex, designed by Goldstein Parham & Labouisse and Herbert A. Benson, George J. Riehl and built by J. A. Jones Company, debuted in 1959 towards the end of Mayor DeLesseps "Chep" Morrison's administration. The core of this structure forms much of the present-day facility. Retired United States Air Force Major-General Junius Wallace Jones served as airport director in the 1950s. During his term, the airport received many improvements. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide (OAG) showed 74 weekday departures: Delta Air Lines 26, Eastern Air Lines 25, National Airlines 11, Capital Airlines 5, Southern Airways 4, and Braniff International Airways 3. Pan American World Airways had six departures each week while TACA, a Central American airline, had four. By the time the 1959 airport terminal building opened, the name Moisant International Airport was being used for the New Orleans facility. At some point in the next few decades, the name was changed to New Orleans International Airport. In July 2001, to honor the 100th anniversary of Louis Armstrong's birth (August 4, 1901), the airport's name became Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. During the administration of Morrison's successor, Vic Schiro, the government sponsored studies of the feasibility of relocating New Orleans International Airport to a new site, contemporaneous with similar efforts that were ultimately successful in Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) and Dallas (Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport). This attempt got as far as recommending a site in New Orleans East; a man-made island was to be created south of I-10 and north of U.S. Route 90 in a bay of Lake Pontchartrain. In the early 1970s it was decided that the current airport should be expanded instead, leading to the construction of a lengthened main terminal ticketing area, an airport access road linking the terminal to I-10, and the present-day Concourses A and B. New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, in office from 1986 to 1994, later reintroduced the idea of building a new international airport for the city, with consideration given to other sites in New Orleans East, as well as on the Northshore in suburban St. Tammany Parish. Only a couple months before Hurricane Katrina's landfall, Mayor Ray Nagin again proposed a new airport for New Orleans, this time to the west in Montz, Louisiana. These initiatives met with the same fate as 1960s-era efforts concerning construction of a new airport for New Orleans. Iftikhar Ahmad is the current director of aviation. Ahmad was approved for employment at MSY in April 2010. He is a graduate of Oklahoma State University with a Masters of Science in Civil Engineering. Ahmad left his director of aviation post at Dayton International Airport where he had been since 2006 to work for MSY. Prior to Dayton, Ahmad had worked in airport management for the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority and the Houston Airport System, which oversees both Houston Bush Intercontinental and Houston Hobby airports. The airport was closed to commercial air traffic on August 28, 2005, shortly before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, and it remained closed as floods affected the city. The Associated Press reported on August 31 that MSY would receive humanitarian flights, and that the airport "has no significant airfield damage and had no standing water in aircraft movement areas", although the airport did, as the article put it, "[sustain] damage to its roofs, hangars and fencing." In early September, the airport opened only to military aircraft and humanitarian flights, and served as a staging center for evacuees.  The airport reopened to commercial flights on September 13, 2005. At about 2:30 EST in the morning on February 2, 2006, a tornado touched down on the grounds of MSY. The damage from the tornado was significant but primarily confined to Concourse C, where American, United, AirTran Airways, and international arrivals were based. Many temporary repairs dating from Hurricane Katrina failed, including one roof patch, forcing airlines based in the concourse to relocate operations to vacant gates. Jetways and other ground equipment also sustained damage. The damage was confirmed by the National Weather Service as being caused by a tornado rated F1. As of late 2006, all of this had been repaired. MSY reopened to commercial flights on September 13, 2005, with four flights operated by Delta Air Lines to Atlanta and a Northwest Airlines flight to Memphis. Slowly, service from other carriers began to resume, with limited service offered by Southwest Airlines, Continental Airlines, and American Airlines.  Eventually, all carriers announced their return to MSY, with the exception of America West Airlines (which merged into US Airways two weeks later) and international carrier TACA. In early 2006, Continental Airlines (since merged into United Airlines) became the first airline to return to pre-Katrina flight frequency levels, and in September 2006, to pre-Katrina seat capacity levels. All international service into MSY was suspended while the FIS facility was closed post-Katrina. The facility reopened to chartered flights arriving from London, Manchester, Bournemouth, and Nottingham, UK—all carrying tourists in for Mardi Gras and set to depart aboard a cruise liner. In May 2010, AirTran announced new daily nonstop service to its hub in Milwaukee utilizing Boeing 717 twin jet aircraft, which then commenced on October 7, 2010. This route marked MSY's first all-new city addition since 1998.  AirTran was acquired by Southwest Airlines, which in turn began operating the route. In November 2010, United Airlines announced resumption of daily nonstop service to San Francisco, the largest pre-Katrina domestic market that had yet to resume service to New Orleans. On July 16, 2012, Spirit Airlines announced nonstop service from Dallas-Fort Worth to New Orleans, commencing in January 2013.  Spirit became the first all-new domestic carrier, and second all-new carrier overall (after WestJet) to announce service to MSY, since 1998. MSY served 9,785,394 passengers in 2014 exceeding the pre-Katrina total of 9,733,179 passengers in 2004, and also approaching the high of 9.9 million passengers who used the airfield in 2000. On November 21, 2006, the New Orleans Aviation Board approved an air service initiative to promote increased service to Armstrong International: On January 17, 2008, the city's aviation board voted on an amended incentive program that waives landing fees for the first two airlines to fly nonstop into a city not presently served from the airport. Under the new ruling, landing fees will be waived for up to two airlines flying into an "underserved destination airport." The incentive previously referred to service to a "new destination airport." The airport is also continuing its incentive to airlines that reach 85% of their pre-Katrina flight frequencies.

These Central American airlines flew a variety of aircraft types into New Orleans, including Airbus A319s, Airbus A320s, Boeing 727-100s, 727-200s, 737-200s and 737-300s as well as British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets.  Earlier services were flown via Douglas DC-6 prop and Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop aircraft. Japan Airlines (JAL) served the airport as part of a "special schedule" service linking Japan and South America in the mid 1960s and early 1970s with a routing of Tokyo-Honolulu-Los Angeles-New Orleans-Caracas-Belem-Rio de Janeiro flown with Douglas DC-8 jetliners. Twice weekly seasonal New Orleans-to-Montego Bay nonstops via the Jamaica Shuttle/Casino Express (typically chartered Boeing 727-200 or 737-300 jets) operated for a decade during most of the 1990s and into the 2000s. Laker Airways flew twice weekly seasonal Boeing 727-200 jet service nonstop between New Orleans and Freeport, Bahamas in the early 2000s. Armstrong International's Concourse C, located in the airport's West Terminal, contains a fully enclosed US Customs, Immigration, and FIS facility. The majority of the concourse's 15 gates offer direct access to this area and are thus capable of accepting foreign arrivals from all over the world, on aircraft as large as Boeing 747-400 intercontinental jetliners. Currently, Air Canada, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines operate scheduled international passenger service from the airport with Air Canada flying to Toronto, Canada and Delta Air Lines and United Airlines flying to Cancun, Mexico.  Copa Airlines began flying nonstop to Panama City, Panama on June 25, 2015. On July 14, 2010, Air Canada announced the resumption of daily nonstop service between Toronto and New Orleans, utilizing Bombardier CRJ705 regional jet aircraft (which is a version of the Canadair CRJ-900) operated by Air Canada Express featuring two classes of service. Service on this route began on October 30, 2010. On March 7, 2015, Delta Air Lines initiated new nonstop service once a week every Saturday to Cancun, Mexico with these flights being operated with Airbus A319 aircraft. United Airlines initiated new weekly nonstop service to Cancun, Mexico every Saturday effective May 9, 2015 with these flights being operated with Boeing 737-900 aircraft. Copa Airlines initiated new nonstop Boeing 737-700 service between New Orleans and Panama City, Panama on June 25, 2015 with these flights being operated four times a week.http://www.copaair.com, News The inbound flight, CMP 498, departs Panama at 5:30 PM and arrives into New Orleans at 9:15 PM on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Vacation Express currently offers Boeing 737 charter flight service operated by Swift Air and AeroMexico to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and Cancun, Mexico on a seasonal basis. Branson Air Express operated by Orange Air initiated scheduled charter flight service to Cancun, Mexico on May 6, 2015 with McDonnell Douglas MD-83 jetliners.  This service was an extension of a route from Branson, MO and Cincinnati, OH. On October 2, 2015, it was announced that Elite Airways would take over the Branson - New Orleans - Cancun service until the end of November, 2015. The service has since been discontinued. On March 8, 2011, MSY was one of eight cities given approval for charter flights to Cuba. The first charter flight to Havana, Cuba occurred on March 14, 2015 for the Cuba Hoy Conference. Louis Armstrong International has two terminals, East and West, connected by a central ticketing alley. Attached are four concourses, A, B, C, and D. The vaulted arrivals lounge at the head of Concourse C and the adjacent, western half of the ticketing alley are the remaining portions of the airport's 1959 terminal complex. Concourse A opened in 1974 and has 6 Gates: A1, A3, A5, A6, A7, A8. Most recently home to now-defunct Northwest Airlines and US Airways, this concourse is closed until further notice. Concourse B opened in 1974 and has 11 Gates: B1, B2, B4, B5, B7-B12, B15. Southwest Airlines (Gates B2, B4, B5, B7, B8, B9) and GLO Airlines (Gate B15) operate out of this concourse.  Gate B1 space has been taken over by TSA for passenger screening, and the gate is no longer in use.  Gates B10, B11, and B12 are currently vacant. Except customs pre-cleared flights, all nonstop international arrivals are handled by Concourse C.  This concourse also contains both common-use and overflow gates, available for infrequent services and charter flights as well. Concourse C opened on March 18, 1992 and was remodeled in 2007, according to a design by Manning Architects, after being damaged in a tornado the previous February. Concourse C has 15 Gates: C1 – C12, C14 – C16. Allegiant Air (Gate C3), Copa Airlines (Gate C1), JetBlue Airways (Gate C5), Alaska Airlines (Gate C4), Delta Air Lines (Gate C3 for Seasonal International Arrival/Departure), Spirit Airlines (Gate C6), Frontier Airlines (Gate C7), American Airlines (Gates C8 - C12, C15 and C16), Vacation Express (Gates C1 and C3 for Seasonal International Arrival/Departure), and United Airlines (Gate C2 for Seasonal International Arrival/Departure) all operate out of this concourse. The newest concourse, D, opened on December 23, 1996 and houses a Delta Air Lines Sky Club in between gates D2 and D4, the sole such airline club remaining at Armstrong. Originally completed with only six gates, Concourse D received a six-gate rotunda addition, designed by Sizeler Thompson Brown,Travel – Sizeler Thompson Brown and inaugurated in 2011. This rotunda includes gates D7-12 Concourse D has 12 operating Gates: D1 – D12. Delta Air Lines (Gates D2, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12), United Airlines (Gates D1, D3, D5, D7, D9, D11), and Air Canada Express (Gate D7) operate from Concourse D. Bus service between the airport and downtown New Orleans is provided by Jefferson Transit bus E-2. The airport also features taxicab services furnished by third-party operators that have fixed price schedules ($36 for first two passengers, $14 for each additional passenger) for rides to the city's Central Business District. All cabs serving the airport are required to accept credit cards for all services rendered. Airport Shuttle has services to most hotels and hostels in the Central Business District of New Orleans for $20 per person (one-way) and $38 per person (round-trip). The New Orleans Aviation Board, along with the Mayor of New Orleans and City Council, recently approved a plan to build a brand new $807 million terminal building on the north side of the airport property. Hunt-Gibbs-Boh-Metro is listed as the contractor at-risk. Construction is set to begin in January 2016. The terminal is scheduled to be finished in October 2018, five months behind the originally-targeted completion date of May 2018, which would have been in time for New Orleans' 300th anniversary. The new terminal will have two concourses, totaling 30 gates. There will be a centralized security checkpoint with all new shops and restaurants behind the security checkpoint. A new garage with 2,000 parking spaces is also planned, along with a new, privately-funded airport hotel. Airlines flying out of MSY have also, at their expense, funded the construction of a $39 million fuel system. A new entrance to the airport will route to I-10 via Loyola Drive. The plans call for demolishing concourses A, B and C of the existing southside terminal complex, while repurposing concourse D for charter services and administrative offices. The airport currently has 34 gates but only uses 30 gates; the new terminal is designed for 30 gates, with an option to expand to 42.

Aviation Safety Network. Retrieved on December 23, 2009. Eastern Air Lines Flight 304 operated with a Douglas DC-8 flying from New Orleans International Airport to Washington Dulles International Airport crashed on February 25, 1964 nine minutes after takeoff. All 51 passengers and 7 crew members were killed. On March 20, 1969, Douglas DC-3 N142D, leased from Avion Airways for a private charter, crashed on landing, killing 16 of the 27 passengers and crew members on board. The aircraft was operating a domestic non-scheduled passenger flight from Memphis International Airport, Tennessee. On July 9, 1982, Pan Am Flight 759, en route from Miami to Las Vegas, departed New Orleans International. The Boeing 727-200 jetliner took off from the east-west runway (Runway 10/28) traveling east but never gained an altitude higher than . The aircraft traveled 4,610 feet (1405 m) beyond the end of Runway 10, hitting trees along the way, until crashing into a residential neighborhood. A total of 153 people were killed (all 145 on board and 8 on the ground). The crash was, at the time, the second-deadliest civil aviation disaster in U.S. history. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause was the aircraft's encounter with a microburst-induced wind shear during the liftoff. This atmospheric condition created a downdraft and decreasing headwind forcing the plane downward. Modern wind shear detection equipment protecting flights from such conditions is now in place both onboard planes and at most commercial airports, including Armstrong International. TACA Flight 110 forced to land on a levee east of New Orleans International Airport after flame-out in both engines no casualties. On March 21, 2015, a man walked into the airport armed with a machete and Molotov cocktails and began attacking TSA agents. He was subsequently shot and killed by a Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Deputy.
