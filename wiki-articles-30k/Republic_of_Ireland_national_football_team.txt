   The Republic of Ireland national football team () represents Ireland in association football. It is governed by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and plays its home fixtures at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. The team made their debut at the 1924 Summer Olympics, reaching the quarter-finals. Between 1924 and 1936, the team competed as the Irish Free State and from then until 1950, it was referred to by the FAI as Éire or Ireland. In 1953, FIFA decreed that for competitive matches in tournaments that both Irish teams may enter, the FAI team would be officially called the Republic of Ireland while the IFA team was to be named Northern Ireland.http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2010/03/northern-ireland-programmes-1882-1889.html Northern Ireland was allowed to use the title Ireland by FIFA in the Home International Competition until it was discontinued in 1984. Ireland was the first nation from outside the United Kingdom to defeat England at home at a fixture played at Goodison Park, Liverpool, in 1949. The team also reached the Quarter Final stage of the 1964 European Nations' Cup, where they lost to the eventual winners Spain. Under the guidance of Jack Charlton, the team enjoyed its most successful era, reaching their highest FIFA ranking ever which was 6th in the world in August 1993, and qualifying for UEFA Euro 1988 in their first appearance at the UEFA European Championship, reaching the quarterfinals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in their first ever appearance at the finals, and making the last 16 at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Charlton's successor Mick McCarthy lost out on the next two major tournaments but ultimately qualified for the 2002 World Cup, making it to the last 16. Under Giovanni Trapattoni, the team narrowly lost out on qualification for the 2010 World Cup during a controversial play-off, but went on to qualify for UEFA Euro 2012. The team failed to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil which marked the end of Giovanni Trapattoni's tenure as manager. Ireland also fell to a record low FIFA ranking of 59th. The team fell further to a record low of 70th in June 2014.FIFA Rankings FIFA.com. Retrieved: 2014-03-13. For the next Euro qualifying campaign under manager Martin O'Neill, Ireland finished third behind Germany and Poland, but went on to qualify for Euro 2016 after a 3-1 aggregate win over Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs. Between 1882 and 1924, Ireland was represented by a single national football team organised by the Belfast-based Irish Football Association (IFA). In 1920, Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State (the latter in turn becoming Éire or Ireland after adopting a new Constitution in 1937, followed by declaring itself a republic in 1948.) Following the initial political upheavals surrounding Partition, a Dublin-based organisation calling itself the Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS) split from the IFA in 1921 and began organising its own league and national football team. In 1923, the FAIFS was recognised by FIFA as the governing body of the Irish Free State and at the 1924 Summer Olympics, the Irish Free State made their international debut. On 28 May, at the Stade Olympique, they beat Bulgaria 1–0, with Paddy Duncan scoring the team's first ever goal. As a result of this they qualified for the quarter-finals."1924 Olympic Games at Rsssf". RSSSF."History of Irish Football". clubi.ie. On 14 June 1924, the Irish Free State made their home debut against the United States, who had embarked on a brief European tour after competing in the same Summer Olympics. Ed Brookes scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 home win at Dalymount Park."United States results at Rsssf". RSSSF. The Irish Free State did not play their next game until 21 March 1926. This was an away game against Italy which they lost 3–0. In subsequent years the status of the Olympic Games football competition was downgraded and as a result this game is widely regarded as the Irish Free State's first official game. On 25 February 1934, the Irish Free State made their FIFA World Cup debut, drawing 4–4 with Belgium at Dalymount Park in a 1934 FIFA World Cup qualifier. Paddy Moore scored all four of the Free State's goals and became the first player ever to score four goals in a FIFA World Cup game.http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-football-results/1940-1959.htm After 1936, they reverted to the designation "Football Association of Ireland" and began to refer to their team as Éire or "Ireland". During this whole period, there were two Irish international football teams, chosen by two rival Associations. Both Associations, the Northern Ireland – based IFA and the Irish Free State – based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and considered themselves entitled to select players from the whole island. At least thirty-eight dual internationals were selected to represent both teams,"List of Dual Internationalists". nifootball. however the overwhelming majority of these were Southerners who also agreed to play for the IFA team, with only a bare handful "crossing the border" in the other direction. A 2–0 win over England at Goodison Park on 21 September 1949, was the first time England suffered a home defeat by a team outside the Home Countries of Scotland, Wales and the Ireland team run by the Belfast-based Irish FA. FIFA eventually intervened when both teams entered 1950 FIFA World Cup qualification, the first time they had entered the same competition. Four players – Tom Aherne, Reg Ryan, Davy Walsh, Con Martin – actually played for the two different teams in the same FIFA World Cup tournament.Ryan, op. cit. pg 59. All four players concerned had been born in the Irish Free State and made their full international debut in FAI colours before agreeing to represent the IFA team. This may have alarmed the FAI, since they subsequently lobbied FIFA to prevent the IFA from picking Southern-born players (as well as attempting to exert pressure on the players themselves, sometimes through their clubs). FIFA's response was to restrict the eligibility of players on the basis of the (political) border, further ruling in 1953 that neither team could be referred to as Ireland in competitions which both teams were eligible to enter i.e. initially the FIFA World Cup and subsequently the European Nations Cup (now the UEFA European Football Championship). FIFA decreed that the FAI team officially be called the Republic of Ireland while the IFA team was to be named Northern Ireland.Byrne, op. cit., pg 68. In 1953, FIFA renamed the team from "Ireland" to "Republic of Ireland". The 1958 FIFA World Cup qualifiers saw the Republic of Ireland drawn with England. In their home game against England, Alf Ringstead put the hosts 1–0 up before John Atyeo equalised in the last minute to salvage a 1–1 draw for England. Under the rules of the day, a win for the Republic of Ireland would have meant a play-off with England for a place in the FIFA World Cup. After reaching the quarter-finals of the 1964 European Nations' Cup, the Republic of Ireland were drawn to face Spain and Syria in 1966 FIFA World Cup qualification. Despite Syria's withdrawal, this was still considered a qualifying group with the Irish winning 1–0 at home and losing 4–1 away. This meant a play-off at the Parc des Princes in Paris, which Spain won 1–0 Eamon Dunphy made his Ireland début in this game. The play-off was originally scheduled to take place at Wembley Stadium in London, home to a large Irish diaspora, but the FAI agreed with the Spanish FA to have the match moved to Paris, where a large Spanish diaspora lived. The FAI was criticised for this move to boost revenue from gate receipts. In 1965, the Republic of Ireland team made history when selecting Manchester United full-back Shay Brennan for the senior national team. This was the first instance of a player born outside the Republic being selected to play for the national team due to having an Irish parent. Since then, many of the Republic's most prominent players have been born in England; including Mark Lawrenson, David O'Leary, John Aldridge, Tony Cascarino and David Kelly. A number of Scottish born players, including Ray Houghton, have since represented the Republic due to having Irish parentage. The selection rules were later relaxed to allow for the selection of players with an Irish grandparent. In 1969 the FAI appointed Mick Meagan as the first permanent manager of the national side. His two years in charge were marked by exceptionally poor results however, with the team losing 5 out of 6 matches and gaining just one point in their 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification, and doing no better in the UEFA Euro 1972 qualifiers, leading to his dismissal. His replacement, Liam Tuohy did a somewhat better in the 1974 FIFA World Cup qualification, and more importantly oversaw major improvements to the national team's training facilities and persuaded many English club sides to end their policies of not releasing Irish players for international games during the domestic season. Ultimately however, the team still failed to qualify for the World Cup, and Tuohy resigned following a dispute over his wages. Johnny Giles became the side's first player-manager in the 1970s. This was followed by the debut of a young Liam Brady and results improved markedly.http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-football-results/1970-1979.htm The side missed out on the 1978 FIFA World Cup by two points, having defeated France at home during qualification. After a less than impressive performance at the UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying, in which the team finished well behind group winners England and Northern Ireland, Giles resigned, saying that he had taken the national side as far as he could.http://www.fai.ie/domestic/news/fai-history-1960-1986 Eoin Hand took over as manager for the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, and once more the Republic of Ireland narrowly missed out on qualification, this time on goal difference behind France who they had defeated at home once more. Disappointing qualifying campaigns for both the 1984 European Championship and 1986 FIFA World Cup followed, ending Hand's time in charge. In 1986, the Republic of Ireland appointed Jack Charlton, a top rated English manager who had been part of England's World Cup winning side of 1966. During the 1970s, he had developed Middlesbrough into a side which provided many players to the dominant Liverpool team of the time.  After taking charge of the Republic of Ireland, Charlton influenced changes in the national side which resulted in arguably the most successful period of its history, winning the Iceland Triangular Tournament by defeating Iceland and Czechoslovakia in May 1986"Iceland Triangular Tournament 1986". RSSSF. and qualifying for two FIFA World Cups and a European Championship.SOCCER; "Ireland Brings Cup Team With an English Accent to America", The New York Times, 29 May 1994. Ireland's first appearance at a major finals tournament came in UEFA Euro 1988, with qualification being secured through Gary Mackay's famous goal in Sofia that meant Scotland beat Bulgaria 1–0 and left Ireland on top of the group. In the finals in West Germany, Ireland beat England 1–0 in Stuttgart with a header from Ray Houghton, drew 1–1 with the Soviet Union in Hannover, with Ronnie Whelan the scorer, and lost to the Netherlands 1–0 in Gelsenkirchen, coming within seven minutes of a draw that would have meant a semi-final place. The Republic of Ireland's longest competitive winning streak was achieved in 1989 during the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. Five games against Spain, Northern Ireland, Hungary and Malta twice, were all wins for the Irish. Subsequently, the side made it to the 1990 FIFA World Cup (Italia '90). Three draws in the group stage against England, Egypt and the Netherlands was enough to make the knockout stage. Virtually the whole country watched as they beat Romania on penalties with Packie Bonner making a vital save and David O'Leary scoring the decisive spot-kick. Ireland were then beaten 1–0 by Italy in the quarter final in the Olympic Stadium, Rome. During the tournament the team had an audience with Pope John Paul II, and were the only team to do so. After missing out on UEFA Euro 1992 (despite being unbeaten in qualifying), the Republic of Ireland qualified for the 1994 FIFA World Cup (USA '94). In their first match, they beat the previous World Cup hosts and 3rd-place finishers Italy 1-0, in their opening game at Giants Stadium just outside New York City; but lost to Mexico 2-1 at the Citrus Bowl in the heat and humidity of Orlando, Florida; and they tied with Norway 0-0 at Giants Stadium. With these results, they made it to the second round, eventually losing 2–0 to the Netherlands in Orlando. In 1996, Ireland finished second behind Portugal in UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying Group 6 but narrowly missed out on UEFA Euro 1996 after losing by a score of 2–0 a play-off at Anfield between the two worst group runners-up to the Netherlands, the other worst runner-up, with Patrick Kluivert scoring both goals to send his team through. It was Jack Charlton's final game as manager. Charlton was replaced by Mick McCarthy but Ireland still missed out on the next two major tournaments. Ireland just managed to finish second to Romania in their 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign after Tony Cascarino scored a late goal to win the away match with Lithuania. A play-off with Belgium followed, with the match at Lansdowne Road finishing in a 1–1 draw, the match in Belgium finishing 2–1 to the home team and substitute David Connolly being sent off in the latter, preventing Ireland from progressing to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. FIFA awarded the FIFA Fair Play Award for 1997 to the Irish supporters "for their exemplary behaviour at Ireland team matches, especially the FIFA World Cup qualifying play-offs against Belgium". Ireland's opponents in UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying Group 8 were Yugoslavia, Croatia, Malta and Macedonia. Macedonia scored a last-minute equaliser that denied Ireland top spot in the group, instead they faced Turkey in a play-off to decide which team would participate in UEFA Euro 2000. The match in Dublin finished in a 1–1 draw and Turkey qualified with the away goal after a 0–0 draw at the end of which Tony Cascarino became involved in a fight and retired from international football. Ireland took on both Portugal and the Netherlands in 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 2 and ended the group in second place with 24 points from ten matches; seven victories and three draws. Despite this unbeaten run, Ireland were drawn in a play-off with Iran. The match in Dublin finished in a 2–0 victory to Ireland with goals from Ian Harte (penalty) and Robbie Keane, while the match in Tehran, played in front of 100,000 spectators, finished in a 1–0 for Iran, not enough to send them through. So McCarthy did manage to lead Ireland to the 2002 FIFA World Cup (Korea/Japan '02), only for the team to lose inspirational captain Roy Keane due to the pair's infamous public spat in Saipan. 1–1 draws with Cameroon and Germany were followed by a 3–0 victory over Saudi Arabia in Group E. The Irish once again progressed to the knockout stage, only losing narrowly 3–2 on penalties to Spain in Suwon after Robbie Keane's last minute equalising penalty kick forced the game into extra-time. After a poor start to qualifying for UEFA Euro 2004, McCarthy was replaced by Brian Kerr but he also struggled to guide the side to the tournament or the following 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and was sacked in October 2005. Kerr was replaced by Steve Staunton (assisted by Bobby Robson in the position of "international football consultant") in January 2006. Under Staunton, results varied widely but the team still failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008 and Staunton lost the position in October 2007. His reign included a humiliating 5–2 defeat to Cyprus during UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group D, one of the worst defeats in the team's history.  Giovanni Trapattoni was appointed manager in February 2008 following a spell with assistant coach Don Givens in charge. Trapattoni went through all ten first round 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying games unbeaten, winning four of the ten games. Ireland lost out on a place in the 2010 FIFA World Cup after a controversial narrow loss to France in the play-offs. Ireland went down 0–1 in the first leg, and lost 2–1 on aggregate, with William Gallas scoring a controversial goal in extra time in the second leg after Thierry Henry had handled the ball before crossing for Gallas to score. This followed another controversy over FIFA's last-minute decision to seed the play-off draw. In 2011, Ireland hosted and won the inaugural Nations Cup with wins against Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland without conceding a goal. In their Euro 2012 qualifying group Ireland finished second, losing only the home fixture against Russia. They thus reached the play-offs and were drawn against Estonia, whom they beat 5–1 on aggregate. UEFA Euro 2012 was Ireland's first major tournament since 2002, but in Group C they lost all three matches, against Croatia, Spain and Italy. UEFA announced a special award for the fans of the Irish team, who notably sang in the last few minutes against Spain, despite trailing 4–0.  Ireland were drawn in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group C alongside Germany, Sweden, Austria, Faroe Islands and Kazakhstan. On 12 October, Ireland suffered their largest ever competitive home defeat, 6–1 against Germany in the Aviva Stadium. Ireland lost against Sweden and Austria in early September 2013, effectively ending the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign, and Giovanni Trapattoni resigned as team manager the following day. Noel King was appointed interim senior manager on 23 September 2013 following the resignation of Giovanni Trapattoni. On 5 November 2013, the Football Association of Ireland announced that Martin O'Neill would be Trapattoni's replacement as manager, with former team captain Roy Keane as his assistant. They assumed their roles when the team met on 11 November where they won against Latvia 3–0 and drew against Poland 0–0 . For the UEFA Euro 2016 qualification phase, the Republic of Ireland were drawn in Group D against Georgia, Germany, Gibraltar, Poland, and Scotland.http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/standings/index.html The team played against Gibraltar for the first time, beating them 7–0, and scored an away draw against World Cup champions, Germany, a few days later in October 2014.http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/day=3/session=3/index.html On 8 October 2015, The Republic of Ireland beat World champions Germany 1-0 in the Euro 2016 qualifiers at the Aviva Stadium Dublin.

A goal from Robbie Brady almost secured a victory for the Irish until Edin Džeko equalized 1–1 to end of the match. In the second leg played at the Aviva Stadium, Jonathan Walters, a God among men,http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/jon-walters-the-most-underrated-man-in-football/43433 scored two goals leading to a 2-0 victory for the Irish. In the end Ireland won the play-off by 3-1 on aggregate, qualifying them for Euro 2016.Walters double takes Ireland to UEFA EURO 2016 The FIFA World Cup 2018 qualification draw took place on 25 July 2015 when the team were drawn in Group D against Austria, Georgia, Moldova, Serbia, and Wales.  Traditionally, the team has played in a home strip of green shirt, white shorts, and green socks. The second strip is usually the reverse of these colours, although there have been exceptions, such as an orange shirt in the late 1990s. Squad numbers are either white with an orange trim, on the home shirts, or green with an orange trim. The FAI logo appears at the bottom of the numbering. A limited edition grey shirt was used just once, in a match against Wales on 17 November 2007. A black jersey with a green stripe across the chest was worn in the final game of the 2011 Nations Cup against Scotland and in a friendly against Italy in Liège in Belgium. The current kit has been supplied by Umbro since 1994. In March 2009, Umbro signed a deal with the FAI to keep them as kit suppliers to the team until 2020.  Home Away   Since the 1980s, most home matches have been played at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, the national rugby stadium owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU). The ground was closed for redevelopment in 2007, with the replacement ground, the Aviva Stadium, opening on 14 May 2010. The first soccer match in the Aviva was Manchester United against a League of Ireland XI side, managed by Damien Richardson, on 4 August 2010.[43] Manchester United won the game 7–1, with Park Ji-Sung scoring the first ever goal in the Aviva Stadium. Aviva Stadium is jointly owned by the IRFU and FAI, although it will return to solely IRFU ownership on expiry of the current 60-year lease. The first football international played at Lansdowne Road by a FAI team was a friendly against Italy in 1971 (an IFA team first played in 1878 against England); a 5–0 victory over San Marino in a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group D match on 15 November 2006 was the last game there before the reconstruction. The all-seater capacity of Lansdowne Road prior to the renovation was 36,000, although higher attendances, using the standing only areas, were permitted for friendly matches. The Aviva Stadium's status as an all-seater increased capacity for competitive games to 51,700. The opening game at the Aviva Stadium, a controversial 1–0 friendly defeat to Argentina, was noted for Robbie Keane securing his membership in the FIFA Century Club and manager Giovanni Trapattoni's absence due to surgery, with assistant manager Marco Tardelli taking charge.   With the announcement of the rebuilding of Lansdowne Road, a new venue was required to stage the Republic of Ireland's home internationals. The only stadium in Ireland deemed suitable to stage international football was the 84,500 capacity Croke Park, home of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). To accommodate this, the GAA temporarily relaxed its rule governing the playing of "foreign" games on its property. Initially, four UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group D matches were played at Croke Park in 2007, resulting in two wins and two draws. Prior to the 1980s, the Republic of Ireland played most home games at Dalymount Park, home of Bohemians, but progressively more games were played at Lansdowne Road following a safety review which reduced Dalymount's capacity. The last international match played there was against Morocco in 1990. The Republic of Ireland have also played home matches in Tolka Park (twice) and the RDS Arena in Dublin as well at the Mardyke and Flower Lodge grounds in Cork. These games in Cork were, until 2009, the only two home Irish internationals played outside of Dublin. During the construction of the Aviva Stadium, two friendly games were played in Thomond Park, Limerick, in 2009. Two further friendlies were played in the RDS Arena in May 2010. Ireland matches are broadcast by Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ), Sky Sports, and Setanta Ireland. Sky Sports shows most of Irelands friendly matches, while RTE shows competitive games such as World Cup and European Championship qualifiers. RTÉ briefly lost its broadcast rights in 2002 when the FAI controversially sold them in a multi-million deal to Sky Sports, a subscription based satellite channel. The decision was criticised by fans and politicians, and the Consumers' Association of Ireland (CAI) described the FAI as "greedy". The FAI was eventually forced to reverse its decision and to allow RTÉ to continue its broadcasts after the government intervened to stop the sale of important Irish sporting events to non-terrestrial television broadcasters.  RTÉ will hold the rights until 2018. The selection of young Northern Irish born players, especially those who have already represented Northern Ireland at youth level, into Republic of Ireland national teams has been controversial, as these players are able to claim Irish nationality even though born and brought up outside the Republic's territory. This has led to accusations of unfairness and predatory behaviour. In Northern Ireland it is seen by Northern Ireland supporters as having the effect of dividing international football in their country along sectarian lines, whereby Nationalists will declare for the Republic of Ireland while Unionists continue to play for Northern Ireland. It has also been argued that it is actually the sectarian divisions, which already existed in Northern Irish football, that are a factor in a number of players switching to the Republic. . Traditionally, those in the North who identify as Irish, predominantly Catholics and nationalists, support the Republic of Ireland team."Why are the same fans not celebrating both Irish victories?".

Belgium) became the first player anywhere to score 4 goals in a World Cup match.  For the 1950 FIFA World Cup, after 3 qualified teams withdrew, FIFA invited the FAI to compete as a replacement: they declined. During qualification for the 1962 FIFA World Cup, it was the only qualifying tournament in which the team had a 0% record.  During qualification for the 1966 World Cup, Ireland reached their first playoff against Spain. Goal difference did not count, so a playoff was played in Stade Colombes, Paris and Ireland failed to progress. Ireland almost qualified but lost on goal difference to France in a tough and tight group.  Fans lamented some controversial refereeing decisions  For the 1990 FIFA World Cup Ireland reached the quarter finals of the tournament for the first time in their history. It was Ireland's first ever participation in a FIFA World Cup.  Ireland played England in the first drawing 1–1.http://www.soccer-ireland.com/world-cup-1990/  Ireland drew the next 2 games but ultimately qualified for the knockout stages where they played Romania.  The match ended 0–0 and Ireland won on Penalties 5–4 which sent Ireland into the quarter final showdown against the tournament host Italy.  Ireland lost 1–0 via a Salvatore Schillaci goal at the 38 minute and sent the Irish out of the competition.  In 1994 Ireland participated in their second consecutive World Cup.http://www.soccer-ireland.com/world-cup-1994/index.htm This time they were drawn with Mexico, Norway and Italy.  Ireland won their first game against Italy which was the first time Ireland had won a World Cup match and their first ever victory over Italy with a spectacular goal from Ray Houghton. Ireland lost against Mexico in the second group match and drew with Norway but still made to the knockout phase where they faced Holland. Ireland lost 2–0. For the 1998 qualification campaign, Ireland scraped into the playoffs largely due to Tony Cascarino's 7 goals in 10 games. They lost in the playoff against Belgium, drawing 1–1 in the first leg then losing 2–1 in the second leg.http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-qualifying-campaigns/world-cup-1998.htm Although for next campaign Ireland were drawn with 2 big European nations, Holland Portugal.  Ireland went the whole campaign unbeaten, beating Holland 1–0 in the process courtesy of a Jason McAteer goal that helped Ireland qualify.http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-qualifying-campaigns/world-cup-2002.htm  At the start of the tournament, captain Roy Keane and manager Mick McCarthy where involved in a "bust up" and Keane was sent home.  Despite this McCarthy did not call up a replacement and continued with 22 players.  Ireland drew in their first match against Cameroon and in their second match they drew again against the tournaments runner up Germany. In Ireland's final group game they defeated Saudi Arabia which was their second ever victory in a FIFA World Cup and progressed them to the round of 16.  Ireland met Spain and lost in penalty shoot out.http://www.soccer-ireland.com/world-cup-2002/index.htm With failure to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ireland reached a playoff against France for a place at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-qualifying-campaigns/world-cup-2010.htm  France's Thierry Henry's handball stirred international controversy after the move set up William Gallas to score in extra-time of the second leg of the playoff; the referee did not notice and allowed the goal to stand, leading to widespread media controversy, protests at the French embassy in Dublin and comments from senior government officials from both countries.[ ][ ] Draws include knockout matches decided by penalty shootout.  In 1964 Ireland reached the quarter finals of qualifying for the European Championship.http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-qualifying-campaigns/nations-cup-1964.htm Ireland did not qualify for a European Championship until the 1988 UEFA European Championship. On 12 June 1988 in Stuttgart the Irish football team took to the pitch in its first match at a major championship finals competition. Ray Houghton of Liverpool FC scored the only goal of the match as Ireland recorded a memorable and historic victory.
