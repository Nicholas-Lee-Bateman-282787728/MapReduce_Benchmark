  The velvet worms (Onychophora&nbsp;—&nbsp;literally "claw bearers") are a minor ecdysozoan phylum with approximately 180 species. These obscurely segmented organisms have tiny eyes, antennae, multiple pairs of legs, and slime glands. They have variously been compared to worms with legs, caterpillars, and slugs. Most common in tropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere, they prey on smaller animals such as insects, which they catch by squirting an adhesive mucus. In modern zoology, they are particularly renowned for their curious mating behaviour and for bearing live young. The two extant families of velvet worms are Peripatidae and Peripatopsidae. They show a peculiar distribution, with the peripatids being predominantly equatorial and tropical, while the peripatopsids are all found in what used to be Gondwana. Formerly considered part of Tracheata, velvet worms are now considered close relatives of the Arthropoda and Tardigrada, with which they form the taxon Panarthropoda. This makes them of palaeontological interest, as they can help reconstruct the ancestral arthropod.  Velvet worms are segmented creatures with a flattened cylindrical body cross-section and rows of unstructured body appendages known as lobopods (informally: stub feet). The animals grow to between 0.5 and 20&nbsp;cm (.2 to 8&nbsp;in), with the average being about 5&nbsp;cm (2 &nbsp;in), and have between 13 and 43 pairs of legs. Their skin consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmenting—outwardly inconspicuous and identifiable only in the regular spacing of the pairs of legs—is visible in the regular arrangement of skin pores, excretion organs and concentrations of nerve cells. The individual body sections are largely unspecialised; even the head develops only a little differently from the abdominal segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same gene as in other groups of animals and is activated in each case, during embryonic development, at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet.  The stub feet that characterise the velvet worms are conical, baggy appendages of the body, which are internally hollow and have no joints. Although the number of feet can vary considerably between species, their structure is basically very similar. Rigidity is provided by the hydrostatic pressure of their fluid contents, and movement is usually obtained passively by stretching and contraction of the animal's entire body. However, each leg can also be shortened and bent by internal muscles. Due to the lack of joints, this bending can take place at any point along the sides of the leg. In some species, two different organs are found within the feet:  On each foot is a pair of retractable, hardened (sclerotised) chitin claws, which give the taxon its scientific name: Onychophora is derived from the Greek onyches, "claws"; and pherein, "to carry". At the base of the claws are three to six spiny "cushions" on which the leg sits in its resting position and on which the animal walks over smooth substrates. The claws are used mainly to gain a firm foothold on uneven terrain. Each claw is composed of three stacked elements, like Russian nesting dolls. The outermost is shed during ecdysis, which exposes the next element in — which is fully formed, so does not need time to harden before it is used.{{cite journal |first1=Martin R. |last1=Smith |first2=Javier |last2=Ortega-Hernández |date=October 2014 |title=Hallucigenia's onychophoran-like claws and the case for Tactopoda |journal=Nature |volume=514 |issue=7522 |pages=363–6 |pmid=25132546 |doi=10.1038/nature13576|bibcode=2014Natur.514..363S }}</ref> (This distinctive construction identifies many early Cambrian fossils as early offshoots of the onychophoran lineage.<ref name="doi10.1038/nature13576" />)  Apart from the pairs of legs, there are three further body appendages, which are at the head and comprise three segments:  ===Antennae=== *On the first head segment is a pair of slender [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], which serve in [[sensory perception]].

Instead, their fluid-filled body cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, similarly to many unrelated soft-bodied animals that are cylindrically shaped, for example [[sea anemones]] and various [[worm]]s. Pressure of their [[incompressible]] internal bodily fluid on the body wall provides rigidity, and muscles are able to act against it.  The body wall consists of a non-cellular outer skin, the [[cuticula]]; a single layer of [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] cells forming an internal skin; and beneath this, usually three layers of muscle, which are embedded in connective tissues.  The cuticula is about a [[micrometre|micrometer]] thick and covered with fine [[wiktionary:Villi|villi]]. In composition and structure, it resembles the cuticula of the arthropods, consisting of α-chitin and various [[protein]]s,<ref name=Mayer2015/> although not containing [[collagen]]. It can be divided into an external [[epicuticula]] and an internal [[procuticula]], which themselves consist of exo- and endo-cuticula. This multi-level structure is responsible for the high flexibility of the outer skin, which enables the velvet worm to squeeze itself into the narrowest crevices. Although outwardly [[water-repellent]], the cuticula is not able to prevent water loss by [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and, as a result, velvet worms can only live in [[microclimate]]s with high [[humidity]] to avoid [[desiccation]].  The surface of the cuticula is scattered with numerous fine papillae, the larger of which carry visible villi-like sensitive bristles. The papillae themselves are covered with tiny [[scale (zoology)|scale]]s, lending the skin a [[velvet]]y appearance (from which the common name is likely derived). It also feels like dry velvet to the touch, for which its water-repellent nature is responsible. Moulting of the skin ([[ecdysis]]) takes place regularly, around every 14 days,<ref>{{cite book |first1=Sylvia |last1=Campiglia |first2=Roger |last2=Lavallard |year=1990 |chapter=On the ecdysis at birth and intermoult period of gravid and young ''Peripatus acacioi'' (Onycophora, Peripatidae) |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/?id=BJzFnCunVxsC&pg=PA461 |pages=461–4 |editor1-first=Alessandro |editor1-last=Minelli |title=Proceedings of the 7th International Congress of Myriapodology |isbn=978-90-04-08972-3}}</ref> induced by the [[hormone]] [[ecdysone]].

Beneath this lies a thick layer of connective tissue, which is composed primarily of collagen fibres aligned either [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or [[perpendicular]] to the body's longitudinal axis. Within the connective tissue lie three continuous layers of unspecialised [[smooth muscle|smooth muscular]] tissue. The relatively thick outer layer is composed of annular muscles, and the similarly voluminous inner layer of longitudinal muscles. Between them lie thin diagonal muscles that wind backward and forward along the body axis in a [[spiral]]. Between the annular and diagonal muscles exist fine [[blood vessel]]s, which lie below the superficially recognisable transverse rings of the skin and are responsible for the pseudo-segmented markings.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  Beneath the internal muscle layer lies the body cavity. In cross-section, this is divided into three regions by so-called dorso-ventral muscles, which run from the middle of the underbelly through to the edges of the upper side: a central midsection and on the left and right, two side regions that also include the legs.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  The colouration of Onychophora is generated by a range of pigments.{{Clarify|date=May 2009}} The solubility of these pigments is a useful diagnostic character: in all arthropods and tardigrades, the body pigment is soluble in ethanol. This is also true for the Peripatidae, but in the case of the Peripatopsidae, the body pigment is insoluble in ethanol.<ref name=Monge1995>{{cite journal |first1=Julian |last1=Monge-Najera |date=May 1995 |title=Phylogeny, biogeography and reproductive trends in the Onychophora |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=21–60 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1995.tb00111.x}}</ref>  ===Haemocoel and circulation=== The body cavity is known as a "pseudocoel", or [[haemocoel]]. Unlike a true [[coelom]], a pseudocoel is not fully enclosed by a cell layer derived from the embryonic [[mesoderm]]. A coelom is, however, formed around the [[gonad]]s and the waste-eliminating [[nephridia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  As the name ''haemocoel'' suggests, the body cavity is filled with a [[blood]]-like liquid in which all the organs are embedded; in this way, they can be easily supplied with [[nutrient]]s circulating in the blood. This liquid is colourless as it does not contain [[pigment]]s; for this reason, it only serves a limited role in [[oxygen]] transport. Two different types of blood cells (or [[haemocyte]]s) circulate in the fluid: [[amoebocyte]]s and [[nephrocyte]]s. The amoebocytes probably function in protection from [[bacteria]] and other foreign bodies; in some species, they also play a role in [[reproduction]]. Nephrocytes absorb [[toxin]]s or convert them into a form suitable for [[clearance (medicine)|elimination]] by the nephridia.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  The haemocoel is divided by a horizontal partition, the diaphragm, into two parts: the [[pericardial sinus]] along the back and the [[perivisceral sinus]] along the belly. The former encloses the tube-like heart, and the latter, the other organs. The diaphragm is perforated in many places, enabling the exchange of fluids between the two cavities.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  The heart itself is a tube of annular muscles consisting of [[epithelium|epithelial]] tissues, with two lateral openings ([[wikt:ostium|ostia]]) per segment. While it is not known whether the rear end is open or closed, from the front, it opens directly into the body cavity. Since there are no blood vessels, apart from the fine vessels running between the muscle layers of the body wall and a pair of arteries that supply the antennae, this is referred to as an [[open circulation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  The timing of the pumping procedure can be divided into two parts: [[diastole]] and [[systole (medicine)|systole]]. During diastole, blood flows through the ostia from the pericardial sinus (the cavity containing the heart) into the heart. When the systole begins, the ostia close and the heart muscles contract inwards, reducing the volume of the heart. This pumps the blood from the front end of the heart into the perivisceral sinus containing the organs. In this way, the various organs are supplied with nutrients before the blood finally returns to the pericardial sinus via the perforations in the diaphragm. In addition to the pumping action of the heart, body movements also have an influence on circulation.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  ===Respiration=== Oxygen uptake occurs to an extent via simple [[diffusion]] through the entire body surface, with the coxal vesicles on the legs possibly being involved in some species. However, of most importance is gas exchange via fine unbranched tubes, the [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]]e, which draw oxygen from the surface deep into the various organs, particularly the heart. The walls of these structures, which are less than three micrometers thick in their entirety, consist only of an extremely thin [[biological membrane|membrane]] through which oxygen can easily diffuse. The tracheae originate at tiny openings, the [[spiracle]]s, which themselves are clustered together in dent-like recesses of the outer skin, the [[wikt:atrium|atria]]. The number of "tracheae bundles" thus formed is on average around 75 per body segment; they accumulate most densely on the back of the organism.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  Unlike the arthropods, the velvet worms are unable to control the openings of their tracheae; the tracheae are always open, entailing considerable water loss in [[arid]] conditions. Water is lost twice as fast as in earthworms and forty times faster than in caterpillars.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=S. M. |last1=Manton |date=June 20, 1949 |title=Studies on the Onychophora. VII.

Here, prey can be mechanically dismembered by the mandibles with their covering of fine toothlets. Two [[saliva]]ry glands discharge via a common conductor into the subsequent "throat", which makes up the first part of the front [[intestine]]. The saliva that they produce contains mucus and [[hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s, which initiate in and outside the mouth [[digestion]]. Historically, the salivary glands probably evolved from the waste-elimination organs known as nephridia, which are found homologously in the other body segments.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  The throat itself is very muscular, serving to absorb the partially liquified food and to pump it, via the [[oesophagus]], which forms the rear part of the front intestine, into the central intestine. Unlike the front intestine, this is not lined with a cuticula but instead consists only of a single layer of epithelial tissue, which does not exhibit conspicuous indentation as is found in other animals. On entering the central intestine, food particles are coated with a mucus-based [[peritrophic membrane]], which serves to protect the lining of the intestine from damage by sharp-edged particles. The intestinal epithelium secretes further digestive enzymes and absorbs the released nutrients, although the majority of digestion has already taken place externally or in the mouth. Indigestible remnants arrive in the rear intestine, or [[rectum]], which is once again lined with a cuticula and which opens at the [[anus]], located on the underside near to the rear end.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  ===Excretory organs=== In almost every segment is a pair of excretory organs called nephridia, which are derived from coelom tissue. Each consists of a small pouch that is connected, via a [[flagellum|flagellated]] conductor called a nephridioduct, to an opening at the base of the nearest leg known as a nephridiopore. The pouch is occupied by special cells called [[podocyte]]s, which facilitate [[ultrafiltration]] of the blood through the partition between haemocoelom and nephridium. The composition of the [[urine|urinary]] solution is modified in the nephridioduct by selective recovery of nutrients and water and by isolation of poison and waste materials, before it is excreted to the outside world via the nephridiopore. The most important nitrogenous excretion product is the water-insoluble [[uric acid]]; this can be excreted in solid state, with very little water. This so-called [[uricotelic]] excretory mode represents an adjustment to life on land and the associated necessity of dealing economically with water.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  A pair of former nephridia in the head were converted secondarily into the salivary glands, while another pair in the final segment of male specimens now serve as glands that apparently play a role in reproduction.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  ===Sensory organs=== [[File:Euperipatoides kanangrensis anterior.jpg|thumb|''Euperipatoides kanangrensis'', showing antennae]] The entire body—including the stub feet—is littered with numerous papillae: warty protrusions that carry a [[mechanoreceptor|mechanoreceptive]] bristle (responsive to mechanical stimuli) at the tip, each of which is also connected to further [[sensory nerve cell]]s lying beneath. The mouth papillae, the exits of the slime glands, probably also have a function in [[sensory perception]]. Sensory cells known as "sensills" on the "lips" or labrum respond to chemical stimuli and are known as [[chemoreceptor]]s. These are also found on the two antennae, which can be regarded as the velvet worm's most important sensory organs. Except in a few (typically [[subterranea (geography)|subterranea]]n) species, one [[simple eye in invertebrates|simply constructed eye]] (ocellus) lies laterally, just underneath the head, behind each antenna.<ref name=Mayer2006/> This consists of a chitinous ball [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], a [[cornea]] and a [[retina]] and is connected to the centre of the [[brain]] via an [[optic nerve]].<ref name=Mayer2006/> The retina comprises numerous pigment cells and photoreceptors; the latter are easily modified flagellated cells, whose [[flagellum]] membranes carry a photosensitive pigment on their surface.

Both the gonads and the gonoduct are derived from true coelom tissue.  In females, the two [[ovary|ovaries]] are joined in the middle and to the horizontal diaphragm. The gonoduct appears differently depending on whether the species is live-bearing or [[ovipary|egg-laying]]. In the former, each exit channel divides into a slender oviduct and a roomy "womb", the [[uterus]], in which the embryos develop. The single [[vagina]], to which both uteri are connected, runs outward to the gonopore. In egg-laying species, whose gonoduct is uniformly constructed, the genital opening lies at the tip of a long egg-laying apparatus, the [[ovipositor]]. The females of many species also possess a sperm repository called the [[receptacle seminis]], in which sperm cells from males can be stored temporarily or for longer periods.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  Males possess two separate [[testes]], along with the corresponding sperm vesicle (the [[vesicula seminalis]]) and exit channel (the [[vasa efferentia]]). The two vasa efferentia unite to a common sperm duct, the [[vas deferens]], which in turn widens through the ejaculatory channel to open at the gonopore. Directly beside or behind this lie two pairs of special glands, which probably serve an auxiliary reproductive function; the rearmost glands are also known as anal glands.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  A [[penis]]-like structure has so far only been found in males of the genus ''Paraperipatus'' but has not yet been observed in action. As previously mentioned, males of many Australian species exhibit special structures on the head, which apparently take over certain tasks in transferring sperm to the females. In the species ''Euperipatoides rowelli'', sperm is collected by these structures, and, when a female is encountered, the worm inserts its head in the vagina.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  ==Distribution and habitat== [[File:Euperipatoides kanangrensis enrolled.jpg|thumb|''Euperipatoides kanangrensis'', enrolled due to sudden exposure (i.e. being plucked from its log into the desiccating daylight)]] Velvet worms live in all [[tropical]] habitats and in the [[temperate zone]] of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], showing a [[circumtropical]] and [[circumaustral]] distribution.

The claws of the feet are only used on hard, rough terrain where a firm grip is needed; on soft substrates, such as moss, the velvet worm walks on the foot cushions at the base of the claws.  The actual locomotion is achieved less by the exertion of the leg muscles than by local changes of body length. This can be controlled using the annular and longitudinal muscles. If the annular muscles are contracted, the body cross-section is reduced, and the corresponding segment stretches, since its volume must remain constant due to the incompressible behaviour of the coelom's liquid contents; this is the usual mode of operation of the hydrostatic skeleton as also employed by other worms. Due to the stretching, the legs of the segment concerned are lifted and swung forward. Local contraction of the longitudinal muscles then shortens the appropriate segment, and the legs, which are now in contact with the ground, are moved to the rear. This part of the locomotive cycle is the actual leg stroke that is responsible for forward movement. The individual stretches and contractions of the segments are coordinated by the nervous system such that contraction waves run the length of the body, each pair of legs swinging forward and then down and rearward in succession. ''Macroperapitus'' can reach speeds of up to four centimetres per second,<ref name=Read1987/> although speeds of around 6 body-lengths per minute are more typical.<ref name="doi10.1111/j.1096-3642.1950.tb01699.x">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.1950.tb01699.x| title = The Evolution of Arthropodan Locomotory Mechanisms.-Part I.

As worded it implies the onychophoran!|date=November 2013}}<ref name=Read1987/> Hungry Onychophora spend less time investigating their prey and are quicker to apply their slime.<ref name=Read1987/> Once slime has been squirted, Onychophora will stop at nothing to hound down and devour their prey, in order to recoup the energetic investment. They have been observed to spend up to ten minutes searching for removed prey, after which they return to their slime to eat it.<ref name=Read1987/> In the case of smaller prey, they may opt not to slime it at all.<ref name=Read1987/>  Subsequently, a soft part of the prey item (usually a joint membrane in arthropod prey) is identified, punctured with a bite from the jaws, and injected with saliva. This kills the prey very quickly and begins a slower process of digestion.<ref name=Read1987/> While the onychophoran waits for the prey to digest, it salivates on its slime and begins to eat it (and anything attached to it). It subsequently tugs and slices at the earlier perforation to allow access to the now-liquefied innards of its prey.<ref name=Read1987/>  The jaws operate by moving backwards and forwards along the axis of the body (not in a side-to-side clipping motion as in arthropods), conceivably using a pairing of musculature and hydrostatic pressure.<ref name=Mayer2015/>  The pharynx is specially adapted for sucking, to extract the innards; the arrangement of the jaws about the tongue and lip papillae ensures a tight seal and the establishment of suction.<ref name=Mayer2015/>  In social groups, the dominant female is the first to feed, not permitting competitors access to the prey item for the first hour of feeding. Subsequently, subordinate individuals begin to feed. The number of males reaches a peak after females start to leave the prey item.<ref name=Reinhard2005/> After feeding, individuals clean their antennae and mouth parts before re-joining the rest of their group.<ref name=Reinhard2005/> Because it takes so long to ingest a prey item, hunting mainly happens around dusk; the onychophorans will abandon their prey at sunrise.<ref name=Read1987/>  This predatory way of life is probably a consequence of the velvet worm's need to remain moist. Due to the continual risk of desiccation, often only a few hours per day are available for finding food. This leads to a strong selection for a low cost-benefit ratio, which can barely be achieved with a herbivorous diet.  ===Reproduction and life-cycle=== [[Image:Onycophora (515525252).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Peripatoides]]'' sp., clearly showing the stub feet]] Almost all species of velvet worm reproduce sexually. The sole exception is ''[[Epiperipatus]] imthurni'', of which no males have been observed; reproduction instead occurs by [[parthenogenesis]].<ref name='Read1988'>{{cite journal |first1=V. M. St. J. |last1=Read |date=July 1988 |title=The Onychophora of Trinidad, Tobago, and the Lesser Antilles |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=225–57 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1988.tb01362.x}}</ref>  All species are in principle sexually distinct and bear, in many cases, a marked [[sexual dimorphism]]: the [[female]]s are usually larger than the [[male]]s and have, in species where the number of legs is variable, more legs. The females of many species are fertilized only once during their lives, which leads to [[animal sexual behavior|copulation]] sometimes taking place before the [[reproductive organ]] of the females are fully developed. In such cases, for example at the age of three months in ''[[Macroperipatus]] torquatus'', the transferred sperm cells are kept in a special [[reservoir]], where they can remain [[:wikt:viable|viable]] for longer periods.  Fertilization takes place [[internally]], although the mode of [[sperm]] transmission varies widely. In most species, for example in the [[genus]] ''[[Peripatus]]'', a package of sperm cells called the [[spermatophore]] is placed into the genital opening of the female. The detailed process by which this is achieved is in most cases still unknown, a true [[penis]] having only been observed in species of the genus ''Paraperipatus''. In many Australian species, there exist [[dimple]]s or special [[dagger]]- or [[axe]]-shaped structures on the head; the male of ''[[Florelliceps]] stutchburyae'' presses a long [[spine (zoology)|spine]] against the female's genital opening and probably positions its spermatophore there in this way. During the process, the female supports the male by keeping him clasped with the claws of her last pair of legs. The mating behavior of two species of the genus ''[[Peripatopsis]]'' is particularly curious. Here, the male places two-millimetre spermatophores on the back or sides of the female. [[Amoebocyte]]s from the female's [[blood]] collect on the inside of the [[wikt:deposition|deposition]] site, and both the spermatophore's casing and the body wall on which it rests are decomposed via the [[secretion]] of [[enzyme]]s. This releases the sperm cells, which then move freely through the [[haemocoel]], penetrate the external wall of the ovaries and finally fertilize the [[ovum|ova]]. Why this self-inflicted skin injury does not lead to bacterial infections is not yet understood (though likely related to the enzymes used to deteriorate the skin or facilitate the transfer of viable genetic material from male to female).  Velvet worms are found in egg-laying ([[ovipary|oviparous]]), egg-live-bearing ([[ovovivipary|ovoviviparous]]) and live-bearing ([[vivipary|viviparous]]) forms.  *Ovipary occur solely in the Peripatopsidae, often in regions with erratic food supply or unsettled climate. In these cases, the [[yolk]]-rich [[egg (biology)|egg]]s measure 1.3 to 2.0&nbsp;mm and are coated in a protective chitinous shell. [[Maternal]] care is unknown. *The majority of species are ovoviviparous: the medium-sized eggs, encased only by a double membrane, remain in the [[uterus]]. The [[embryo]]s do not receive food directly from the mother, but are supplied instead by the moderate quantity of yolk contained in the eggs—they are therefore described as [[lecithotrophic]]. The young emerge from the eggs only a short time before birth. This probably represents the velvet worm's original mode of reproduction, i.e., both oviparous and viviparous species developed from ovoviviparous species. *True live-bearing species are found in both families, particularly in tropical regions with a stable climate and regular food supply throughout the year. The embryos develop from eggs only micrometres in size and are nourished in the uterus by their mother, hence the description "[[matrotrophic]]". The supply of food takes place either via a secretion from the mother directly into the uterus or via a genuine tissue connection between the epithelium of the uterus and the developing embryo, known as a [[placenta]]. The former is found only outside the American continents, while the latter occurs primarily in America and the Caribbean and more rarely in the [[Old World]]. The [[gestation]] period can amount to up to 15&nbsp;months, at the end of which the [[offspring]] emerge in an advanced stage of development. The embryos found in the uterus of a single female do not necessarily have to be of the same age; it is quite possible for there to be offspring at different stages of development and descended from different males. In some species, young tend to be released only at certain points in the year.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Muriel H. |last1=Walker |first2=Noel N. |last2=Tait |date=December 2004 |title=Studies of embryonic development and the reproductive cycle in ovoviviparous Australian Onychophora (Peripatopsidae) |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=264 |issue=4 |pages=333–54 |doi=10.1017/S0952836904005837}}</ref>  A female can have between 1 and 23 offspring per year; development from fertilized ovum to adult takes between 6 and 17&nbsp;months and does not have a [[larva]]l stage. This is probably also the original mode of development. Velvet worms have been known to live for up to six years.  ==Ecology==  ===Predators and parasites=== The velvet worm's important predators are primarily various spiders and centipedes, along with [[rodent]]s and [[bird]]s, such as, in Central America, the Clay-coloured Thrush (''[[Turdus grayi]]''). Hemprichi's Coral Snake (''[[Micrurus hemprichii]]'') feeds almost exclusively on velvet worms. For defence, some species roll themselves reflexively into a spiral, while they can also fight off smaller opponents by ejecting slime.  Various [[mite]]s ([[Acari]]) are known as [[ectoparasite]]s, which infest the skin of the velvet worm. Skin injuries are usually accompanied by bacterial infections, which are almost always fatal.  ==Conservation status== [[Image:Eoperipatus totoro.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Recently discovered ''[[Eoperipatus totoro]]'' is known from only one location in southern Vietnam]] The global [[conservation biology|conservation]] status of velvet worm species is difficult to estimate; many species are only known to exist at their type locality (the location at which they were first observed and described). The collection of reliable data is also hindered by low population densities, their typically [[nocturnal]] behaviour and possibly also as-yet undocumented seasonal influences and sexual dimorphism.  To date, only eleven species have been studied in sufficient detail to enable population estimates, of which three—''[[Opistopatus roseus]]'', ''[[Speleoperipatus spelaeus]]'' and ''[[Peripatopsis leonina]]''—are considered critically endangered, the last being probably already [[extinct]]. Two species—''[[Macroperipatus insularis]]'' and ''[[Tasmanipatus anophthalmus]]''—are assessed by the [[IUCN]] as [[endangered]], while four further species are listed as [[threatened]].<ref>[http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/search.php?freetext=Onychophora&modifier=phrase&criteria=wholedb&taxa_species=1&redlistCategory%5B%5D=all&country%5B%5D=all&cty_default=1&aquatic%5B%5D=all&aqu_default=1&regions%5B%5D=all&reg_default=1&habitats%5B%5D=all&threats%5B%5D=all&redlistAssessyear%5B%5D=all&growths%5B%5D=all 2007 IUCN Red List&nbsp;– Search]{{dead link|date=November 2014}}</ref>  The primary threat comes from destruction and fragmentation of velvet worm habitat due to [[industrialisation]], draining of [[wetland]]s, and [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture. Many species also have naturally low population densities and closely restricted geographic ranges; as a result, relatively small localised disturbances of important [[ecosystem]]s can lead to the extinction of entire populations or species. Collection of specimens for universities or research institutes also plays a role on a local scale.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  There is a very pronounced difference in the protection afforded to velvet worms between regions: in some countries, such as South Africa, there are restrictions on both collecting and [[export]]ing, while in others, such as Australia, only export restrictions exist. Many countries offer no specific safeguards at all. Tasmania has a protection programme that is unique worldwide: one region of forest has its own velvet worm conservation plan, which is tailored to a particular velvet worm species.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  ==Development== Although Onychophorans fall within the protostome group, their early development has a deuterostome trajectory (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes that occur in early development.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.2628| title = Fate and nature of the onychophoran mouth-anus furrow and its contribution to the blastopore| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 282| issue = 1805| pages = 20142628| year = 2015| last1 = Janssen | first1 = R.| last2 = Jorgensen | first2 = M.| last3 = Lagebro | first3 = L.| last4 = Budd | first4 = G. E.}}</ref>  ==Phylogeny== In their present forms, the velvet worms are probably very closely related to the arthropods, a very extensive taxon that incorporates, for instance, the crustaceans, insects, and arachnids. They share, among other things, an exoskeleton consisting of a-chitin and non-collagenous proteins; gonads and waste-elimination organs enclosed in true coelom tissue; an open blood system with a tubular heart situated at the rear; an abdominal cavity divided into pericardial and perivisceral cavities; respiration via tracheae; and similar embryonic development. Segmentation, with two body appendages per segment, is also shared. However, antennae, mandibles, and oral papillae are probably not homologous to the corresponding features in arthropods, i.e., they probably developed independently.  Another closely related group are the comparatively obscure water bears ([[Tardigrada]]); however, due to their very small size, these lack some characteristics of the velvet worms and arthropods, such as blood circulation and separate respiratory structures. Together, the velvet worms, arthropods, and water bears form a [[monophyletic]] taxon, the [[Panarthropoda]], i.e., the three groups collectively cover all descendants of their last common ancestor.  Due to certain similarities of form, the velvet worms were usually grouped with the water bears to form the taxon [[Protoarthropoda]]. This designation would imply that both velvet worms and water bears are not yet as highly developed as the arthropods. Modern systematic theories reject such conceptions of "primitive" and "highly developed" organisms and instead consider exclusively the historical relationships among the taxa. These relationships are not as yet fully understood, but it is considered probable that the velvet worms' sister groups form a taxon designated [[Tactopoda]], thus:  {{clade|label1=Panarthropoda|1={{clade|1= {{nowrap|Velvet worms (Onychophora)}}|label2=Tactopoda|2={{clade|1= Water bears (Tardigrada)|2= Arthropods (Arthropoda)}}}}}}  For a long time, velvet worms were also considered related to the [[annelid]]s. They share, among other things, a worm-like body; a thin and flexible outer skin; a layered musculature; paired waste-elimination organs; as well as a simply constructed brain and simple eyes. Decisive, however, was the existence of segmentation in both groups, with the segments showing only minor specialisation. The parapodia appendages found in annelids therefore correspond to the stump feet of the velvet worms.  Within the [[Articulata hypothesis]] developed by [[Georges Cuvier]], the velvet worms therefore formed an evolutionary link between the annelids and the arthropods: worm-like precursors first developed parapodia, which then developed further into stub feet as an intermediate link in the ultimate development of the arthropods' appendages. Due to their structural conservatism, the velvet worms were thus considered "living fossils". This perspective was expressed paradigmatically in the statement by the French zoologist A. Vandel:  :''Onychophorans can be considered highly evolved annelids, adapted to terrestrial life, which announced prophetically the Arthropoda. They are a lateral branch which has endured from ancient times until today, without important modifications.''  Modern taxonomy does not study criteria such as "higher" and "lower" states of development or distinctions between "main" and "side" branches—only family relationships indicated by [[cladistic]] methods are considered relevant. From this point of view, several common characteristics still support the Articulata hypothesis — segmented body; paired appendages on each segment; pairwise arrangement of waste-elimination organs in each segment; and above all, a [[rope-ladder]]-like nervous system based on a double nerve strand lying along the belly.  An alternative concept, most widely accepted today, is the so-called [[Ecdysozoa]] [[hypothesis]]. This places the annelids and Panarthropoda in two very different groups: the former in the [[Lophotrochozoa]] and the latter in the Ecdysozoa. Mitochondrial gene sequences also provide support for this hypothesis.<ref>{{ cite journal |title= The Complete Mitochondrial Genome of the Onychophoran ''Epiperipatus biolleyi'' Reveals a Unique Transfer RNA Set and Provides Further Support for the Ecdysozoa Hypothesis |author= Podsiadlowski, L.; Braband.

For example, in the first case, the rope-ladder nervous system would have developed in the two groups independently, while in the second case, it is a very old characteristic, which does not imply a particularly close relationship between the annelids and Panarthropoda.  The Ecdysozoa concept divides the taxon into two, the Panarthropoda into which the velvet worms are placed, and the sister group [[Cycloneuralia]], containing the threadworms ([[Nematoda]]), horsehair worms ([[Nematomorpha]]) and three rather obscure groups: the mud dragons ([[Kinorhyncha]]); penis worms ([[Priapulida]]); and brush-heads ([[Loricifera]]).  {{clade|label1=Protostomia|1={{clade|label1=Ecdysozoa|1={{clade|1= {{nowrap|Panarthropoda (arthropods, velvet worms, water bears)}}|2= Cycloneuralia (threadworms, horsehair worms, and others)}} |2=Lophotrochozoa (annelids, mollusc,s and others)|3=Others}}}}  Particularly characteristic of the Cycloneuralia is a ring of "circumoral" nerves around the mouth opening, which the proponents of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis also recognise in modified form in the details of the nerve patterns of the Panarthropoda. Both groups also share a common skin-shedding mechanism ([[ecdysis]]) and molecular biological similarities. One problem of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is the velvet worms' subterminal mouth position: unlike in the Cycloneuralia, the mouth is not at the front end of the body, but lies further back under the belly. However, investigations into their developmental biology, particularly regarding the development of the head nerves, suggest that this was not always the case and that the mouth was originally terminal (situated at the tip of the body). This is supported by the [[fossil record]].  The "stem-group arthropod" hypothesis is very widely accepted, but some trees suggest that the onychophorans may occupy a different position; their brain anatomy is more closely related to that of the [[chelicerate]]s than to any other arthropod.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Nicholas J. |last1=Strausfeld |first2=Camilla Mok |last2=Strausfeld |first3=Rudi |last3=Loesel |first4=David |last4=Rowell |first5=Sally |last5=Stowe |title=Arthropod phylogeny: onychophoran brain organization suggests an archaic relationship with a chelicerate stem lineage |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |volume=273 |issue=1596 |pages=1857–66 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16822744 |pmc=1634797 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3536}}</ref>  ==Evolutionary history== {{see also|Lobopodia}} Fossils from the early Cambrian bear a striking resemblance to the velvet worms.

All genera are assigned to one of two families, the distribution ranges of which do not overlap but are separated by arid areas or oceans:  *The Peripatopsidae exhibit relatively many characteristics that are perceived as original or "primitive". They have between 13 and 25 pairs of legs, behind or between the last of which is the genital opening (gonopore). Both oviparous and ovoviviparous, as well as genuinely viviparous, species exist, although the Peripatopsidae essentially lack a placenta. Their distribution is circumaustral, encompassing Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, New Guinea, South Africa and Chile.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} *The Peripatidae exhibit a range of derivative features. They are longer, on average, than the Peripatopsidae and also have more leg pairs, numbering between 22 and 43—the gonopore is always between the penultimate pair. There are no oviparous species—the overwhelming majority are viviparous. The females of many viviparous species develop a placenta with which to provide the growing embryo with nutrients. Distribution of the Peripatidae is restricted to the tropical and subtropical zones; in particular, they inhabit Central and northern South America, several Caribbean islands, West Africa, northern India, Malaysia, and various [[Indonesia]]n islands.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  ==Human uses== Although velvet worms have no economic implications today, [[Papuan people|Papuans]] once believed them to be poisonous and therefore used them in 'malignant witchcraft'.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=88.

They open outwards at the crural papillae—small wart-like bumps on the belly side of the leg—and secrete chemical messenger materials called pheromones. Their name comes from the Latin cruralis meaning "of the legs". Coxal vesicles are pouches located on the belly side of the leg, which can be everted and probably serve in water absorption. They are only found within the family Peripatidae and are named from coxa, the Latin word for "hip".
