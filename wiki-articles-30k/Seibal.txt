   Seibal (), known as El Ceibal in Spanish, is a Classic Period archaeological site of the Maya civilization located in the northern Petén Department of Guatemala. It was the largest city in the Pasión River region.Sharer & Traxler 2006 p. 520. The site was occupied from the Preclassic Period through to the Terminal Classic, with a significant hiatus.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 520. Kelly 1996, p. 154. The principal phase of occupation dates to the Late Preclassic (400 BC &ndash; AD 200), followed by a decline in the Early Classic (AD 200&ndash;600).Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 520. Seibal experienced a significant recovery in the Terminal Classic immediately prior to its complete abandonment,Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 520. reaching its second peak from about 830 to 890, with a population estimated at 8&ndash;10,000 people.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 689. Kelly 1996, p. 154. The dates on the stelae at Seibal are unusually late, with monuments still being dedicated after the Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the Petén region.Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 61. Many of Seibal's late monuments show artistic influence from central Mexico and from the Gulf Coast of Mexico. The early history of the site is lost due to the catastrophic defeat of the polity in AD 735 by the nearby Petexbatun kingdom with its capital at Dos Pilas, resulting in the destruction of its earlier sculpted monuments.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 177. Seibal was reduced to being a vassal state until the destruction of the Petexbatun kingdom in the late 8th century AD.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 520. In AD 830 a new elite installed itself at the site with the arrival of Wat'ul Chatel from Ucanal to the east. This new arrival reinvigorated Seibal and allowed it to last to the dawn of the 10th century, well after the Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the region.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 524. Seibal is a corruption of the Spanish word ceibal, meaning "place where many ceiba trees grow". El Ceibal was the name of a lumber camp near the ruins at the time of their discovery. The change in spelling originated with a publication by Teoberto Maler in 1908, which used a Germanic form with initial "s".Coe 1999, p. 9. Kelly 1996, p. 154. Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 175. Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology (1). Seibal is located on bluffs about  above the Pasión River, a major tributary of the Usumacinta River.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 520. Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 60. About  downstream, the Pasión River joins with the Salinas River to form the Usumacinta, which flows northwards to the Gulf of Mexico.Smith 1968, p. 82. The site lies in the Petén department of northern Guatemala,  east of the modern town of Sayaxché.Smith 1968, p. 82. Seibal lay  east of the Late Classic city of Dos Pilas and  south of Tikal.Martin & Grube 2000, p. 58. Smith 1968, p. 82. Lake Petén Itzá lies  to the north of the ruins.Smith 1968, p. 82. Seibal lies among tropical rainforest on a limestone plain that is intermittently hilly and flat.Smith 1968, p. 82.  Surveys have revealed an average of 436 structures per square kilometer (1118 per square mile) in the site core, falling to 244 structures/km² (626/square mile) in the periphery.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 686. At its height in the Late Preclassic, the population has been estimated at 1600 in the site core with a further 8000 dispersed through the periphery, to produce an estimated total population of almost ten thousand.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 688. In the Early Classic the population suffered a severe decline,Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 690. population is estimated to have dropped to 34% of peak population.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 689. In the Late to Terminal Classic the population increased to 85% of its Late Preclassic level, an expansion that appears to have occurred rapidly and spread to all parts of the site,Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 689. Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 73. perhaps as the result of an influx of refugees arriving from other sites around AD 830.Webster 2002, p. 278. This was followed by a population crash to 14% of peak Preclassic population in the Early Postclassic (AD 900&ndash;1200) prior to the complete abandonment of the site.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 689. The social stratification of Seibal was that of priest-kings, as well as nobility and elites living in the main ceremonial center, with the common people living in the peripheries of the city.  During the 1964-68 excavations, 34 of the 45 found burials were from the peripheral zone, showing the distribution of population by class.Willey and Smith 1975-1990. All dates A.D. The site was occupied by the Middle Preclassic, then declined from the Late Preclassic through to the Early Classic, with a renewed expansion in the Late to Terminal Classic before being completely abandoned. Seibal was first settled around 900 BC in the Preclassic Period.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 176. It reached its peak population in the Late Preclassic around 200 BC, at the end of the Cantuse ceramic phase (300-200 CE).Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 288-9. Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 176.Willey and Smith 1975-1990 Ceramics from the deep Middle Preclassic levels at Seibal belong to the little-known Real/Xe phase, found in the western Petén region.Coe 1999, p. 54. A cruciform Olmec-style cache consisting of a bloodletter and jade celts is similar to those found in the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and the artifacts were probably manufactured at La Venta.Coe 1999, p. 54. Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 202. This cache dates to approximately 900 BC.Adams 1996, p. 82. After the Real/Xe complex, came the Escoba period, dating to approximately 600CE-300CE. The ceramics between these two periods are similar, but Escoba ceramics are more extensive and stratigraphically separated. There is also evidence during this time of the population increase that would peak at the end of the Cantutse period.Willey and Smith 1975-1990 The earliest settlement in the Middle Preclassic was mostly confined to Group&nbsp;A. After 300 BC, in the Late Preclassic, settlement expanded to include Group&nbsp;D.Smith 1968, p. 82. During this period, there is evidence of ceremonial structures being build both in Group A and D. By the end of the Late Preclassic (or Protoclassic), Seibal experienced an unexplained decline in population.Smith 1968, p. 84. During the Early Classic, the decline that began in the Late Preclassic continued unabated until the site was all but abandoned around AD 300 for unknown reasons.Smith 1968, p. 84. Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 176. Seibal underwent a revival in the Late Classic with an expansion of occupation linked to the great city of Tikal.Martin & Grube 2000, p. 227. About AD 650 new inhabitants moved into the city in order to found a new kingdom.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 176. Groups&nbsp;A and D saw new construction, with a particular emphasis on Group&nbsp;D, which became an important part of the ceremonial centre.Smith 1968, p. 84. Any monuments raised by the Late Classic rulers responsible for this renewed occupation were defaced when the city suffered a catastrophic defeat in the 8th century AD.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 177. After the defeat of Seibal, foreign influences can be seen from Central Mexico in the art and stelae of the site dating to the Bayal phase (mid-700 CE-post-classic).Sanders, F.J. 1977 The earliest mention of Seibal in hieroglyphic inscriptions is on Stela&nbsp;15 at Dos Pilas, dated to 13 October 721, and refers to Seibal becoming involved in the long-running war between the great cities of Tikal and Calakmul and their respective allies and vassals. Dos Pilas was a newly founded city in the Petexbatún region, established by Tikal to exert its control over the Pasión River, a strategy that backfired when Calakmul seized control of the fledgling kingdom.Schele & Mathews 1999, pp. 176-177.  In AD 735 Ucha'an K'in B'alam, the third king of Dos Pilas, attacked Seibal, capturing Yich'aak B'alam. The captive king was not executed but rather became a vassal of his more powerful neighbour.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 520. Martin & Grube 2000, p. 58, 61. Coe 1999, p. 130. Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 177. Ucha'an K'in B'alam raised monuments to his victory over Seibal at Dos Pilas, Aguateca and Seibal itself.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 177. Yich'aak B'alam is shown under the feet of Ucha'an K'in B'alam on Aguateca Stela&nbsp;2.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 407. At Seibal a hieroglyphic stairway was built recording the city's new status as a vassal of Dos Pilas. At the same time as he erected these monuments to his victory, Ucha'an K'in B'alam ordered the destruction of the hieroglyphic records on the earlier monuments of Seibal, with inscriptions at Dos Pilas and Aguateca specifically recording the destruction of Seibal's previously recorded history using phrases that translate as "they destroyed the writing" and "they chopped the writing off the statues that were made".Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 177. Yich'aak B'alam continued as a vassal under the next king of Dos Pilas, K'awiil Chan K'inich, who presided over rituals at Seibal in 745 and 747.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 408. Seibal regained its independence in the late 8th century with the destruction of the Dos Pilas kingdom.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 520. Ajaw B'ot acceeded to the throne in AD 771, restoring Seibal as an independent capital.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 409. After AD 800 Seibal fell into a thirty-year hiatus during which no new monuments were erected.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 178.  With its independence came a new  apogee, and for a brief time Seibal became a prominent regional capital located on the important Pasión River trade route. The architecture and ceramics from this period demonstrate connections with the northern Yucatán Peninsula and the Gulf Coast of Mexico.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 521. Seventeen stelae carved between AD 849 and 889 show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, including a lord wearing the beaked mask of Ehecatl, the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style speech scroll emerging from the mouth, carvings of foreign-style foot slippers, and squared cartouches. Some of these stelae have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at Cacaxtla, a site in the central Mexican state of Tlaxcala. This hybrid style seem to indicate that the new lords of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 522. Coe 1999, p. 154. Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs.Coe 1999, p. 154. Changes at Seibal at this time are associated with the Chontal-controlled trade flowing along the Pasión River. The Chontal Maya themselves were warrior-merchants originating from the Gulf Coast of Mexico who displayed a mixture of Maya and non-Maya characteristics.Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 528-9. Hieroglyphic texts at Seibal indicate that the city's newly refound vigour was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of Caracol and Ucanal in the east, two sites that had so far survived the spreading Classic Maya collapse.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 522. It is likely that they were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and were drawn to Seibal by its defensible location overlooking the Pasión River.Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 522-3. Seibal's refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat'ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 523. The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K'awil of Tikal, and Chan Pet, king of Calakmul.Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 313, 361, 524. Wat'ul Chatel built an innovative new temple-stelae arrangement to the south of the Central Plaza of Group&nbsp;A. Structure&nbsp;A-3 consists of a low radial pyramid with an inventive arrangement of sculpted monuments.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 179. Wat'ul Chatel's last monument was erected in 889. This stela is also the last dated monument raised at Seibal and by 900 the city was all but abandoned, the whole region had been engulfed by the Classic Maya collapse and trade no longer flowed along the Pasión-Usumacinta route.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 524. Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 81. Most Classic Maya capitals had already been abandoned and whatever external support Seibal had received from its overlord had vanished.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 524. By 930 AD, the site was completely abandoned. It was left relatively undisturbed until around 1890 when Federico Artes was informed of the city’s ruins. The late stelae at Seibal show a marked reduction in quality over a span of about forty years, with the loss of Classic Period traits, and bearing flatter and cruder representations than earlier stelae. This may reflect the loss of expertise in the Terminal Classic, with craftsmen less able to work monuments and large structures as time progressed.Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 70. The ruins of Seibal were probably discovered around 1890 by loggers working for the Hamett Mahogany Company. Federico Artes first reported the existence of the ruins in 1892 after he was sent to Petén by the Guatemalan government in order to find material to be displayed in the Guatemalan exhibit for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.He was having very little luck getting satisfactory material until he heard through the rumor mill of  the site’s existence, at which point he traveled to Seibal. He took molds from some of the stelae and the resulting casts were displayed in the Exposition, bringing the recent discovery of the ruins to the attention of archaeologists for the first time.Smith 1968, p. 84. Two years later, in July 1895, Seibal was explored by Teoberto Maler on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. He made a site plan and discovered a new stela to add to those already discovered. He returned to the site for further investigations in August 1905 but discovered no new monuments. The Peabody Museum published Maler's work in 1908, including good quality photos of the stelae.Kelly 1996, p. 159. Seibal was next investigated by Sylvanus Morley in 1914 on behalf of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.Kelly 1996, p. 159. Dr Barnum Brown visited the ruins in 1948, and members of the Altar de Sacrificios Expedition of the Peabody Museum made visits in 1961, 1962 and 1963.Smith 1968, p. 84. In 1964, the Peabody Museum returned to the site with a thorough investigation that continued until 1968, led by Gordon R. Willey as Director and A. Ledyard Smith as Field Director.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 520. Kelly 1996, p. 159. Smith 1968, pp. 82, 84. Further excavations were carried out from May to June in 2006 by the Proyecto Arqueológico Ceibal-Petexbatun (Seibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project).Ponciano et al 2007, p. 448. Seibal is a medium-sized site.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 175. The site core is divided into three principal hilltop groups (Groups A, C and D) connected by causeways and covers a little over 1&nbsp;km².Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 520. Smith 1968, p. 84. The causeways were faced with masonry and had parapets in places.Smith 1968, p. 85. Causeway&nbsp;I is the western causeway, Causeway&nbsp;II is the south causeway and Causeway&nbsp;III is the eastern causeway.Smith 1968, p. 85. Group&nbsp;D is a fortress refuge concealed above the river frontage.Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 76. Group&nbsp;B is a small complex located about  from the site core.Smith 1968, p. 85. Group&nbsp;A is smaller than Group&nbsp;D but has most of the sculptured monuments.Smith 1968, p. 85. Various small housemound groups lie beyond the site core. They are spaced between  apart, extending for several kilometers to the north, south and west.Smith 1968, p. 84. Only two structures have been restored at Seibal, the A-3&nbsp;temple platform and the C-79&nbsp;circular platform, topped with the Jaguar Altar. Both were restored during the investigations carried out by the Peabody Museum in the 1960s.Smith 1968, p. 86. Seibal possesses a satellite site located to the north, known as El Anonal. This site has large structures built from clay that date to the Middle Preclassic period.Ponciano et al 2007, pp. 449, 469. Group A is in the site core. It features three plazas, the North, South and Central Plazas and lies at the west end of Causeway&nbsp;I. Group&nbsp;A has more than fifty mounds arranged around the three plazas.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 520. Smith 1968, p. 85. Ponciano et al 2007, p. 452. Monuments dating to the period when Seibal was a vassal of Dos Pilas (AD 735&ndash;761) are situated in the Central Plaza of the group.Schele & Mathews 1999, pp. 177-178 In this group, there is also a ball court that is dated to the Terminal Classic and stylistically resembles that at Uxmal.Willey and Smith 1975-1990 Group C lies on Causeway&nbsp;II, which passes through it to end at the circular Structure&nbsp;C-79. Group&nbsp;C has over forty mounds.Smith 1968, p. 85. Group D is a compact group at the east end of Causeway&nbsp;III, it is perched in an easily defensible position at the edge of the bluffs overlooking the Pasión river.Smith 1968, p. 85. Schele & Mathews 1999, pp. 175-176. It has more than seventy structures crowded around five plazas. Group&nbsp;D only had one stela, which was a plain monument erected in front of a  high stepped pyramid.Smith 1968, p. 85. The East Patio of Group&nbsp;A is part of an acropolis complex located behind Structure&nbsp;A-14. The complex is situated upon a massive platform raised almost  above the natural surface level. The patio was accessed by a stairway on the south side. It includes Structures&nbsp;A-15 and A-16.Ponciano et al 2007, p. 451.  Structure A-3 is a temple platform located in the centre of the south plaza. It has a stairway ascending each of its four sides. Five stelae are associated with this structure, one located at the base of each stairway and a fifth inside the building surmounting the platform.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 520. Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 68. Three large jade cobbles were interred under the central stela.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 182. This structure and its associated stelae were dedicated in AD 849 by king Wat'ul Chatel (also known as Aj B'olon Haab'tal).Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.523. Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 69. Structure&nbsp;A-3 has the remains of a corbeled vault, the only surviving example at Seibal.Kelly 1996, p. 154. The arrangement of the radial pyramid with its associated stelae was highly innovative. The radial temple form was ancient in the Maya region, dating back to the Late Preclassic, but Wat'ul Chatel placed upon it a square shrine with four doors, one opening onto each of the stairways. The temple building contained three vaulted chambers oriented north-south, with doors joining each chamber along an east-west axis. The cornice of the temple supported a brightly coloured stucco frieze. The frieze collapsed with the temple in ancient times. Archaeologists were able to recover portions of the fallen frieze and attempt a reconstruction of how it originally appeared. Each of the four doors was originally topped by a larger-than-life sculpture of king Wat'ul Chatel. Twelve smaller figures were spaced around the cornice, one at each corner with an additional figure positioned half way between each corner and the central figure of the king. It is not known who these smaller figures represented. The spaces between the figures were occupied by panels with cross-hatch designs and sculpted vegetation and animals. Old gods sat in the centre of each of the sixteen panels, including Itzamna and Pawatun. Structure&nbsp;A-3 was built over an earlier platform structure.Schele & Mathews 1999, pp. 179-181. Structure A-10, a  tall temple-pyramid, is the tallest structure at the site.Smith 1968, p. 85. Structure A-13 is a radial pyramid. Excavations uncovered a mass burial (Burial 4) with parts of eleven people, including two women and a child. This was not a traditional Classic Maya burial and has been dated to AD 930, very late in the occupation of the site.Tourtellot & González 2005, pp. 63, 71. Structure A-14 is covered by the forest that has overgrown the northern part of the Central Plaza. It is a range structure running north-south and once had a hieroglyphic stairway detailing Seibal's defeat by Dos Pilas, although the inscriptions have now been removed to the old project camp.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 178. Ponciano et al 2007, pp. 451-452. The structure was found to contain an elite female burial, labelled as Burial&nbsp;1.Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 63. Structure A-15 is located on the north side of the East Patio of the North Plaza. It is a long, low structure running east-west and closing the patio on the north side. It measures  by  tall. The building contained a long room with a wide entrance opening southwards onto the patio, raised from the patio by a step. The room contained a stone bench built from reused blocks. The structure was superimposed upon two earlier substructures, the earliest of which had a different orientation to the final building. All three periods of construction appear to date to the Terminal Classic, with the last phase perhaps dating to about the time of the fall of the city.Ponciano et al 2007, pp. 449-451, 459. Structure A-16 is located on the northeast side of the East Patio of the North Plaza. It is a rectangular structure measuring , running north-south and facing to the west. The remains of the structure stand  high. The western side of the building had been damaged by looters prior to archaeological investigation. The looters' trench measured  by  deep and cut through the structure's floor, bench and rear wall but did not uncover any burials or offerings. Fallen limestone blocks and slabs reveal that the structure once had a corbel-vaulted chamber. Fragments of stucco were also recovered, they once made up a colourful frieze above the front of the building that included modelled human figures. The stucco still had traces of orange, green and yellow paint. The building was a palace-type structure with perhaps six rooms, three on the west side and three on the east, and it was originally roofed in stone. The interior had an L-shaped bench. The structure was built of finely cut limestone blocks and the walls were coated with stucco painted orange and turquoise. It is believed that the building was part of a Terminal Classic royal palace with architectural features similar to those of the temple Structure&nbsp;A-3.Ponciano et al 2007, pp. 449-454, 457.  Structure A-19 and Structure C-9 are ballcourts. They have a resemblance to ballcourts at Chichen Itza.Tourtellot & González 2005, pp. 71-2. Both ballcourts are aligned east-west, an unusual feature in the Maya area, although the topography of the site severely restricted the layout of the city to a principally east-west orientation.Scarborough 1991, p. 138. Ballcourt&nbsp;A-19 lies on the west side on the north plaza.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 520. Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 65. Structure C-79 is a circular three-tiered platform built during the Terminal Classic on top of a pre-existing structure dating to the Late Preclassic Period.Kelly 1996, p. 158. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 521. Circular structures such as this  have their origin in central Mexico, where they are typically temples of Ehecatl, the god of wind.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.520. Miller & Taube p.85. However, the structure at Seibal was surmounted by a rectangular building platform, whereas the temple buildings of Ehecatl were also circular.Tourtellot & González 2005, p. 72. Structure&nbsp;C-79 has two stairways, the larger ascends the west side, the smaller is on the east side.Kelly 1996, p. 158. A circular jaguar altar rests on three pedestals before the structure, two of these are crouching figures that originally supported the altar, the third central column is modern and was put in place as an additional support during restoration of the ruins. The altar has the crude representation of a jaguar's head carved onto its edge.Smith 1968, p. 91. Kelly 1996, p. 158. Structure&nbsp;C-79 and the associated altar are dated to about AD 870.Kelly 1996, p. 158.  The monuments of Seibal include a number of stelae, carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. The monuments at Seibal are fashioned from a hard limestone, accounting for their generally excellent preservation.Kelly 1996, p. 154. During excavations in the 1960s, 57 stelae were identified. Of these 22 were sculpted and 35 were plain.Smith 1968, p. 94. Hieroglyphic Stairway 1 was located on the front of Structure&nbsp;A-14.Ponciano et al 2007, p.451. The stairway was installed by king Ucha'an K'in B'alam of Dos Pilas to record Seibal's status as a vassal after its defeat by that city. The stones are no longer in situ, having been removed to the area of the camp of the old archaeological project.Schele & Mathews 1999, pp.177-178. Stela 1, on the north side of the South Plaza near Structure&nbsp;A-3, names someone called "Knife-Wing", who is also known at distant Chichen Itza. It is dated to AD 869.Tourtellot & González 2005, pp69-70. Kelly 1996, p. 156. Stela 2 is believed to date to around AD 870 although it bears no hieroglyphic text. It depicts the frontal view of a masked figure and is the only monument at Seibal to show a frontal portrayal.Kelly 1996, pp. 156-7. It was broken into six or seven pieces and has been restored.Smith 1968, p. 93. Stela 3 bears a non-Maya calendrical date, one of the glyphs is cipactli, a crocodile head used to represent the first day of the 260-day calendar in central Mexico.Miller 2001, p. 163. This stela once stood next to Stela&nbsp;2 but was removed to a museum in Guatemala City.Kelly 1996, p. 157. Stela 4 is badly damaged, having been broken into pieces by a falling tree. It was lost for sixty years before being rediscovered. It currently remains buried under a thin covering of soil.Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology (2). Stela 5 lies to the north of the South Plaza and is badly damaged. The broken middle section of the stela is all that is left, it bears the representation of a ballplayer and dates to about AD 780.Kelly 1996, p.157. Stela 6 is slightly to the north of Stela&nbsp;5, bearing hieroglyphic text. This stela was damaged in antiquity when the upper part was broken off and erected by an altar nearby.Kelly 1996, p.157. Stela 7 stands to the north of stelae&nbsp;5 and 6. It is in a reasonable state of preservation and bears the image of a ruler dressed as a ballplayer. This monument was probably dedicated in AD 780, although it records the accession of a king of Seibal in AD 771.Kelly 1996, p.157. Stela 8 is a well preserved monument on the south side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat'ul Chatel wears jaguar claws on his hands and feet, together with other attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God.Kelly 1996, p. 156. Schele & Mathews 1999, pp. 190-191. In one hand the king holds the head of the god K'awiil. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands.
