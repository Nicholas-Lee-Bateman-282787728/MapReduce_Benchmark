     Nagpur (Nāgpur) () is the second capital and the third largest city of the Indian state of Maharashtra after Mumbai and Pune.http://www.census2011.co.in/census/state/maharashtra.html It is the 13th largest urban agglomeration in India and the largest city in Vidarbha Region. It has one of the highest literacy rate of 91.92% among all the urban agglomerations in India and one of the proposed Smart Cities from Maharashtra.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-releases-list-of-98-cities-for-smart-city-project/article7586751.ece Nagpur is the seat of the annual winter session of the Maharashtra state assembly, "Vidhan Sabha". It is a major commercial and political centre of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. In addition, the city derives political importance from being the headquarters for the Hindu nationalist organisation RSS and an important location for the Dalit Buddhist movement. According to a survey by ABP News-Ipsos, Nagpur has been identified as the best city in India by topping the liveability, greenery, public transport, and health care indices. It is famous for the Nagpur Orange and is known as the "Orange City" for being a major trade centre of oranges cultivated in the region. The city was founded by the Gonds and later became a part of the Maratha Empire under the royal Bhonsale dynasty. The British East India Company took over Nagpur in the 19th century and made it the capital of the Central Provinces and Berar. After the first reorganisation of states, the city lost its status as the capital. Following the informal "Nagpur Pact" between political leaders, it was made the second capital of Maharashtra. Nagpur is also called the "Tiger Capital of India" as it connects many tiger reserves in India to the world. It is among the important cities for the information technology sector in Maharashtra. Nagpur is located in the centre of the country with the Zero Mile marker indicating the geographical centre of India.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/Why-is-Nagpur-called-the-zero-mile-centre/articleshow/6801564.cms  Also see: Nagpur state One of the earlier names of Nagpur was "Fanindrapur". It derives its origin from the 'fana' or hood of a cobra. In fact, Nagpur's first newspaper was named 'Fanindramani', which means a jewel that is believed to be suspended over a cobra's hood. It is this jewel that lights up the darkness, hence the name of the newspaper. The river Nag flows through the city. B. R. Ambedkar claimed that both the city and the river are named after "Nag people". The word "pur" means "city" in many Indian languages.http://www.unesco.org/most/p2vidal.htm During British rule, the name of the city was spelt and pronounced as "Nagpore".https://books.google.co.in/books?id=W-iNBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT15&lpg=PT15&dq=british+pronounced+nagpore&source=bl&ots=MDb-0kSubn&sig=F1bd4IVt6gRZwa0mB2xPIHPZ2X0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVqbzfnPvJAhXFcI4KHcpVC_wQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=british%20pronounced%20nagpore&f=false In the 18th century, this city was created by leader of Gond tribes named Bhakt Buland (Raja Buland Shah) in the first half of the century. Human existence around present-day Nagpur can be traced back 3000 years to the 8th century BCE. Mehir burial sites at Drugdhamna (near the Mhada colony) indicate that the megalithic culture existed around Nagpur and is still followed. The first reference to the name "Nagpur" is found in a 10th-century copper-plate inscription discovered at Devali in the neighbouring Wardha district. The inscription is a record of grant of a village situated in the visaya (district) of Nagpura-Nandivardhana during the time of the Rastrakuta king Krsna III in the Saka year 862 (940 CE). Towards the end of the 3rd century, King Vindhyasakti is known to have ruled the Nagpur region. In the 4th century, the Vakataka Dynasty ruled over the Nagpur region and surrounding areas and had good relations with the Gupta Empire. The Vakataka king Prithvisena I moved his capital to Nagardhan (ancient name Nandivardhana),  from Nagpur. After the Vakatakas, the region came under the rule of the Hindu kingdoms of the Badami Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, and finally the Yadavas. In 1296, Allauddin Khilji invaded the Yadava Kingdom after capturing Deogiri, after which the Tughlaq Dynasty came to power in 1317. In the 17th century, the Mughal Empire conquered the region. However, regional administration was carried out by the Gond kingdom of Deogarh-Nagpur in the Chhindwara district of the modern-day state of Madhya Pradesh.http://nagpur.gov.in/ehtmldocs/left_link/history.html The next Raja (king) of Deogarh was Chand Sultan, who resided principally in the country below the hills, fixing his capital at Nagpur, which he turned into a walled town. On Chand Sultan's death in 1739, Wali Shah, an illegitimate son of Bakht Buland, usurped the throne and Chand Sultan's widow invoked the aid of the Maratha leader Raghoji Bhonsale of Berar in the interest of her sons Akbar Shah and Burhan Shah. The usurper was put to death and the rightful heirs placed on the throne. After 1743, a series of Maratha rulers came to power, starting with Raghoji Bhonsale, who conquered the territories of Deogarh, Chanda and Chhattisgarh by 1751.http://www.nagpur-hotels.com/nagpur-tourism/history-of-nagpur-people.aspx Nagpur was burnt substantially in 1765 and again partially in 1811 by the marauding tribe pendharis. However, the development of city of Nagpur continued.http://csridentity.com/nagpur/index.asp In 1803 Raghoji II Bhonsale joined the Peshwa against the British in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, but the British prevailed. After Raghoji II's death in 1816, his son Parsaji was deposed and murdered by Mudhoji II Bhonsale. Despite the fact that he had entered into a treaty with the British in the same year, Mudhoji joined the Peshwa in the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1817 against the British but suffered a defeat at Sitabuldi in present-day Nagpur city. The fierce battle was a turning point as it laid the foundations of the downfall of the Bhonsales and paved the way for the British acquisition of Nagpur city. Mudhoji was deposed after a temporary restoration to the throne, after which the British placed Raghoji III Bhonsale, the grandchild of Raghoji II, on the throne. During the rule of Raghoji III(which lasted till 1840), the region was administered by a British resident. In 1853, the British took control of Nagpur after Raghoji III died without leaving an heir.http://www.worldlibrary.org/articles/history_of_nagpur   From 1853 to 1861, the Nagpur Province (which consisted of the present Nagpur region, Chhindwara, and Chhattisgarh) became part of the Central Provinces and Berar and came under the administration of a commissioner under the British central government, with Nagpur as its capital. Berar was added in 1903.https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dUzvBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=nagpur+province&source=bl&ots=khagzJoGgZ&sig=RtgKeCws0s8U0-tgC1-2jDKakzU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjC7uWWitjKAhXH2hoKHeozDY44ChDoAQgaMAA#v=onepage&q=nagpur%20province&f=false The advent of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIP) in 1867 spurred its development as a trade centre.http://www.maharashtraweb.com/Cities/Nagpur/historyofnagpur.asp Tata group started the country's first textile mill at Nagpur, formally known as Central India Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd.

Nagpur is the largest city in central India and the third largest in Maharashtra in terms of population as per the 2011 census. Since the 1990s the urban agglomeration has rapidly expanded beyond the City’s municipal boundaries. This growth has presented challenges for the future growth of the city and its fringes in an organized manner. With a view to achieve balanced development within the region,the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has been notified as the Special Planning Authority (SPA) for the Nagpur Metropolitan Area (NMA) and entrusted with preparation of a Statutory Development Plan as per provisions of the MRTP Act, 1966. The notified NMA comprises areas outside the Nagpur city and includes 721 villages under 9 tehsils of the Nagpur District spreading across an area of 3,567&nbsp;km2.https://www.nitnagpur.org/pdf/Metro_Region_DP.pdf In 1999, the government of Maharashtra declared that the Nagpur Metropolitan Area shall comprise all of Nagpur city, Nagpur Gramin (rural areas near Nagpur), Hingna, Parseoni, Mauda and Kamptee Taluka and parts of Savner, Kalmeshwar, Umred and Kuhi. The boundaries of the "Metro region" around the municipal corporation limits of the city have been defined as per the notification. In 2002, the government extended the jurisdiction of the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) by 25 to 40 kilometres. This new area was defined under clause 1(2) of NIT Act-1936 as "Nagpur Metropolitan Area".
