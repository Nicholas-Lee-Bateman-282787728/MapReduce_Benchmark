  James Maury "Jim" Henson (September 24, 1936&nbsp;– May 16, 1990) was an American puppeteer, artist, cartoonist, inventor, screenwriter, songwriter, musician, actor, film director, and producer. Best known as the creator of the Muppets, Henson was a regular in television series and films from the mid 1950s until his death at age 53. Born in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in Leland, Mississippi, and Hyattsville, Maryland, Henson began developing puppets while attending high school. While he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, he created Sam and Friends, a five-minute sketch-comedy puppet show that appeared on television. After graduating from the University of Maryland with a degree in home economics, he produced coffee advertisements and developed some experimental films. Feeling the need for more creative output, Henson founded Muppets Inc. in 1958 (which would later become the Jim Henson Company). Henson garnered fame in the 1970s when he joined the children's educational television program Sesame Street, and there helped develop characters for the series. He also appeared in the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. In 1976, after scrapping plans for a Broadway show, he produced The Muppet Show. He won fame for his creations, particularly Kermit the Frog, Rowlf the Dog, and Ernie, and he was involved with Sesame Street for over 20 years. He also had frequent roles in Muppets films such as The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan, and created advanced puppets for projects like Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth. During the later years of his life, he also founded the Jim Henson Foundation, and Jim Henson's Creature Shop. His involvement in two television programs - The Storyteller and The Jim Henson Hour - led to Emmy Awards wins. In May 1990, Henson died suddenly from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome – an unexpected event that was widely lamented in the film and television industries. In the weeks after his death, he was celebrated in a wave of tributes. He was posthumously inducted into Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991, and as a Disney Legend in 2011. Henson was born in Greenville, Mississippi, the younger of two boys. His parents were Betty Marcella (née Brown) (1904-1972) and Paul Ransom Henson (1904-1994), an agronomist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He was raised as a Christian Scientist and spent his early childhood in Leland, Mississippi, before moving with his family to Hyattsville, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., in the late 1940s. He later remembered the arrival of the family's first television as "the biggest event of his adolescence," having been heavily influenced by radio ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and the early television puppets of Burr Tillstrom (on Kukla, Fran, and Ollie) and Bil and Cora Baird. He remained a Christian Scientist at least into his twenties when he would teach Sunday School but fifteen years before he died he wrote to a Christian Science church to inform them he was no longer a practicing member.Phoenix New Times  In 1954, while attending Northwestern High School, he began working for WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV), creating puppets for a Saturday morning children's show called The Junior Morning Show. After graduating from high school, Henson enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park, as a studio arts major, thinking he might become a commercial artist.Finch (1993). p. 9. A puppetry class offered in the applied arts department introduced him to the craft and textiles courses in the College of Home Economics, and he graduated in 1960 with a BS in home economics. As a freshman, he had been asked to create Sam and Friends, a five-minute puppet show for WRC-TV. The characters on Sam and Friends were forerunners of Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character: Kermit the Frog.Finch (1993). p. 102. Henson would remain at WRC for seven years from 1954 to 1961. Among the first of his assignments at WRC was Afternoon, a magazine show aimed at housewives. This marked his first collaboration with Jane Nebel — the woman who later became his wife.Finch, Jim Henson&nbsp;– The Works (1993). p. 15. In the show, he began experimenting with techniques that would change the way puppetry had been used on television, including using the frame defined by the camera shot to allow the puppeteer to work from off-camera. Believing that television puppets needed to have "life and sensitivity," Henson began making characters from flexible, fabric-covered foam rubber, allowing them to express a wider array of emotions at a time when many puppets were made of carved wood. A marionette's arms are manipulated by strings, but Henson used rods to move his Muppets' arms, allowing greater control of expression. Additionally, Henson wanted the Muppet characters to "speak" more creatively than was possible for previous puppets—which had seemed to have random mouth movements—so he used precise mouth movements to match the dialogue. When Henson began work on Sam and Friends, he asked fellow University of Maryland sophomore Jane Nebel to assist him. The show was a financial success, but after graduating from college, Henson began to have doubts about going into a career as a puppeteer. He wandered off to Europe for several months, where he was inspired by European puppeteers who look on their work as an art form. Upon Henson's return to the United States, he and Jane began dating. They were married in 1959 and had five children, Lisa (b. 1960), Cheryl (b. 1961), Brian (b. 1963), John (b. 1965, d. 2014), and Heather (b. 1970). Despite the success of Sam and Friends, Henson spent much of the next two decades working in commercials, talk shows, and children's projects before being able to realize his dream of the Muppets as "entertainment for everybody". The popularity of his work on Sam and Friends in the late fifties led to a series of guest appearances on network talk and variety shows. Henson himself appeared as a guest on many shows, including The Steve Allen Show, The Jack Paar Program and The Ed Sullivan Show (although on his appearance on the Sept 11, 1966, episode of the show — released to DVD on 2011 as part of a collection of episodes featuring the Rolling Stones—Sullivan mis-introduced Henson as "Jim Newsom and his Puppets"). This first national television broadcast greatly increased exposure, which led to hundreds of commercial appearances by Henson characters throughout the sixties. During some downtime during a 1964 appearance on the Jack Paar Program, Henson, Frank Oz, Jerry Juhl, and Don Sahlin found a closet door in their dressing room, behind which there were some exposed pipes. They decided to decorate the pipes, adding paint and fake fur to the pipes to give them goofy and monstrous faces. Everyone in the studio was highly entertained by the pipes, but the door was closed and the pipes were largely forgotten. They were rediscovered in 1980, when some construction workers were knocking down walls for a remodel and found the pipes. The pipes were left alone, but when Jimmy Fallon took over as Late Night host in 2009, he encouraged NBC to add the pipes to the studio tour. In 2010, the pipes were placed in a permanent display as a stop on the tour. Among the most popular of Henson's commercials was a series for the local Wilkins Coffee company in Washington, D.C., in which his Muppets were able to get away with a greater level of slapstick violence than might have been acceptable with human actors and would later find its way into many acts on The Muppet Show. In the first Wilkins ad, a Muppet named Wilkins is poised behind a cannon seen in profile. Another Muppet named Wontkins (with Rowlf's voice) is in front of its barrel. Wilkins asks, "What do you think of Wilkins Coffee?" and Wontkins responds gruffly, "Never tasted it!" Wilkins fires the cannon and blows Wontkins away, then turns the cannon directly toward the viewer and ends the ad with, "Now, what do you think of Wilkins?" Henson later explained, "Till then, advertising agencies believed that the hard sell was the only way to get their message over on television. We took a very different approach. We tried to sell things by making people laugh." The first seven-second commercial for Wilkins was an immediate hit and was syndicated and re-shot by Henson for local coffee companies across the United States; he ultimately produced more than 300 coffee ads.Finch (1993). p. 22. The same setup was used to pitch Kraml Milk in the Chicago area, Red Diamond coffee, several bread products, and even Faygo. In 1963, Henson and his wife moved to New York City, where the newly formed Muppets, Inc., would reside for some time. Jane quit performing to raise their children. Henson hired writer Jerry Juhl in 1961 and puppeteer Frank Oz in 1963 to replace her. Henson later credited both with developing much of the humor and character of his Muppets. pp. 50–53, 126. Henson and Oz developed a close friendship and a performing partnership that lasted 27 years; their teamwork is particularly evident in their portrayals of the characters of Bert and Ernie, Kermit and Miss Piggy, and Kermit and Fozzie Bear. Henson's 1960s talk show appearances culminated when he devised Rowlf, a piano-playing anthropomorphic dog. Rowlf became the first Muppet to make regular appearances on a network show, The Jimmy Dean Show. Henson was so grateful for this break that he offered Jimmy Dean a 40% interest in his production company, but Dean declined stating that Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work, a decision of conscience Dean never regretted. From 1963 to 1966, Henson began exploring film-making and produced a series of experimental films. His nine-minute experimental film, Time Piece, was nominated for an Academy Award for Live Action Short Film in 1966. The year 1969 saw the production of The Cube — another Henson-produced experimental movie. Also around this time, the first drafts of a live-action experimental movie script were written with Jerry Juhl, which would eventually become Henson's last unproduced full-length screenplay, Tale of Sand. The script remained in the Henson Company archives until the screenplay was adapted in the 2012 graphic novel, Jim Henson's Tale of Sand.  In 1969, television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and her staff at the Children's Television Workshop, impressed by the quality and creativity of the Henson-led team, asked Henson and staff to work full-time on Sesame Street, a visionary children's program for public television. This union of talents would become legendary in television entertainment. Part of the show was set aside for a series of funny, colorful, puppet characters living on the titular street. These included Grover, Oscar the Grouch, Bert and Ernie, Cookie Monster, and Big Bird. Henson performed the characters of Ernie, game-show host Guy Smiley, and Kermit, who appeared as a roving television news reporter. It was around this time that a frill was added around Kermit's neck to make him more frog-like. The collar was functional as well: it covered the joint where the Muppet's neck and body met. At first, Henson's Muppets appeared separately from the realistic segments on the Street, but after a poor test-screening in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the show was revamped to integrate the two, placing much greater emphasis on Henson's work. Though Henson would often downplay his role in Sesame Street's success, Cooney frequently praised Jim's work and, in 1990, the Public Broadcasting Service called him "the spark that ignited our fledgling broadcast service." The success of Sesame Street also allowed Henson to stop producing commercials. He later remembered that "it was a pleasure to get out of that world". In addition to creating and performing Muppet characters, Henson was involved in producing various shows and animation insets during the first two seasons. During the first, Henson produced a series of counting films for the numbers 1 through 10, which always ended with a baker (voiced by Henson) falling down the stairs while carrying the featured number of desserts. For seasons two to seven, Henson worked on a variety of inserts for the numbers 2 through 12, in a number of different styles — including film ("Dollhouse", "Number Three Ball Film"), stop-motion ("King of Eight", "Queen of Six"), cut-out animation ("Eleven Cheer"), and computer animation ("Nobody Counts To 10"). Jim Henson also directed the original C Is For Cookie. Concurrently with the first years of Sesame Street, Henson directed Tales from Muppetland, a short series of TV movie specials — in the form of comedic telling of classic fairy tales — aimed at a young audience and hosted by Kermit the Frog. The series included Hey, Cinderella!, The Frog Prince, and The Muppet Musicians of Bremen. Concerned that the company was becoming typecast solely as a purveyor of children's entertainment, Henson, Frank Oz, and his team targeted an adult audience with a series of sketches on the first season of the groundbreaking comedy series Saturday Night Live (SNL). Eleven "Dregs and Vestiges" sketches, set mostly in the Land of Gorch, aired between October 1975 and January 1976 [inclusive], with four additional appearances in March, April, May, and September [of 1976]. Henson recalled that "I saw what [creator Lorne Michaels] was going for and I really liked it and wanted to be a part of it, but somehow what we were trying to do and what his writers could write for it never gelled." The SNL writers never got comfortable writing for the characters, and frequently disparaged Henson's creations; one, Michael O'Donoghue, quipped, "I won't write for felt." Around the time of Henson's characters' final appearances on SNL, he began developing two projects featuring the Muppets: a Broadway show and a weekly television series. In 1976, the series was initially rejected by the American networks who believed that Muppets would appeal to only a child audience. Henson was finally able to convince British impresario Lew Grade to finance the show, which would be shot in the United Kingdom and syndicated worldwide. That same year, he scrapped plans for his Broadway show and moved his creative team to England, where The Muppet Show began taping. The Muppet Show featured Kermit as host, and a variety of other memorable characters, notably Miss Piggy, Gonzo the Great, and Fozzie Bear, along with other characters such as Animal. Kermit's role on The Muppet Show was often compared by his co-workers to Henson's role in Muppet Productions: a shy, gentle boss with "A whim of steel" who "[ran] things as firmly as it is possible to run an explosion in a mattress factory." Caroll Spinney, the puppeteer of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, remembered that Henson "would never say he didn't like something. He would just go 'Hmm.' That was famous. And if he liked it, he would say, 'Lovely!' " Henson himself recognized Kermit as an alter-ego, though he thought that Kermit was bolder than he; he once said of the character, "He can say things I hold back." Jim Henson was the performer for several well-known characters, including Kermit the Frog, Rowlf the Dog, Dr. Teeth, the Swedish Chef, Waldorf, and Link Hogthrob. In 1977, Henson produced a one-hour television adaptation of the Russell Hoban story Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas.

In addition to his own puppetry projects, Henson aided others in their work. In 1979, he was asked by the producers of the ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' sequel ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' to aid make-up artist [[Stuart Freeborn]] in the creation and articulation of enigmatic [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]]. Henson suggested to ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]], himself a Muppets fan, that he use [[Frank Oz]] as the puppeteer and voice of Yoda. Oz voiced Yoda in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and each of the four subsequent ''[[Star Wars]]'' films. The naturalistic, lifelike Yoda became one of the most popular characters of the ''Star Wars'' franchise. Lucas even lobbied unsuccessfully to have Oz nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award.<ref name="yodes">Finch (1993). p. 176.</ref>  [[File:Lucas - Henson - 1986.jpg|thumb|left|Henson and producer [[George Lucas]] working on ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' in 1986]] In 1982, Henson founded the [[Jim Henson Foundation]] to promote and develop the art of [[puppetry]] in the United States. Around that time, he began creating darker and more realistic fantasy films that did not feature the Muppets and displayed "a growing, brooding interest in mortality."<ref name="lifemag"/> With 1982's ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'', which he co-directed with Frank Oz and co-wrote, Henson said he was "trying to go toward a sense of realism—toward a reality of creatures that are actually alive [where] it's not so much a symbol of the thing, but you're trying to [present] the thing itself."<ref name="central"/> To provide a visual style distinct from the Muppets, the puppets in ''The Dark Crystal'' were based on conceptual artwork by [[Brian Froud]].  ''The Dark Crystal'' was a financial and critical success and, a year later, the Muppet-starring ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'' (directed by Frank Oz) did fair box-office business, grossing $25.5&nbsp;million domestically and ranking as one of the top 40 films of 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1984&p=.htm |title=1984 Yearly Box Office Results |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref> However, 1986's ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'', a ''Crystal''-like fantasy that Henson directed by himself, was considered (in part due to its cost) a commercial disappointment.

''The Storyteller'' won an Emmy for Outstanding Children's Program. The next year, Henson returned to television with ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]'', which mixed lighthearted Muppet fare with riskier material. The show was critically well received and won Henson another Emmy for Outstanding Directing in a Variety or Music Program, but was canceled after 13 episodes due to low ratings.

"Jim Henson dreamed up the show's basic concept about three years ago," said a ''New York Times'' article in April 1991. <blockquote>'He wanted it to be a sitcom with a pretty standard structure, with the biggest differences being that it's a family of dinosaurs and their society has this strange toxic life style,' said [his son] [[Brian Henson]].

[[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], founded by Henson, also continues to build creatures for a large number of other films and series (e.g. the science-fiction production ''[[Farscape]]'', the film adaptation of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and the movie ''[[MirrorMask]]'') and is considered one of the most advanced and well-respected creators of film creatures. His son Brian and daughter Lisa are currently the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the company; his daughter Cheryl is the president of the foundation. [[Steve Whitmire]], a veteran member of the Muppet puppeteering crew, has assumed the roles of [[Kermit the Frog]] and [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]], the most famous characters formerly played by Jim Henson.<ref>{{cite news |last=Plume|first=Kenneth|url= http://www.muppetcentral.com/articles/interviews/whitmire3.shtml |title=Ratting Out: An Interview with Muppeteer Steve Whitmire |publisher=Muppet Central|date=July 19, 1999 |accessdate=July 11, 2007}}</ref> Whitmire also assumed the roles of [[Link Hogthrob]], from the "Pigs in Space" "Muppet Show" sketch, starting with the video game "Muppets Racemania" from 2000, as well as [[The Muppet Newsman]], starting in 2008, with Muppet.com viral online videos. Muppeteer veteran [[Bill Barretta]] has taken over for Henson's fairly deeper voiced roles, such as [[Swedish Chef|the Swedish Chef]], [[Mah Nà Mah Nà|Mahna Mahna]], [[Rowlf the Dog]], and [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Dr. Teeth|Dr. Teeth]]. [[Guy Smiley]], in recent years, has been taken over by [[Eric Jacobson]], and the role of [[Statler and Waldorf|Waldorf]], in 1992, was assumed by Muppeteer veteran [[Dave Goelz]].  On February 17, 2004, it was announced that the non-''[[Sesame Street]]''/''[[Fraggle Rock]]'' Muppets (the ''Sesame Street'' characters are separately owned by [[Sesame Workshop]], and the ''Fraggle Rock'' characters are still owned by The Jim Henson Company) and the ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'' properties had been sold by Henson's heirs to The Walt Disney Company. However, as a result, Sesame Workshop (formerly the Children's Television Workshop), also lost the rights to Kermit the Frog, and thus he would not appear on new material on ''Sesame Street'' for some time. However, Sesame Workshop has since obtained permission from Disney to use Kermit, allowing him to make an appearance on the premiere of the show's 40th season on November 10, 2009.  In addition, Sesame Workshop has made many of Kermit's previous segments on the show available for viewing on their [[YouTube]] account.  One of Henson's last projects is a show attraction in [[Walt Disney World]] and [[Disneyland]] featuring the Muppets, called [[Muppet*Vision 3D]], which opened in 1991, shortly after his death.  The Jim Henson Company retains the Creature Shop, as well as the rest of its film and television library including ''Fraggle Rock'' (one of the few Muppet-related properties still owned by The Jim Henson Company), ''[[Farscape]]'', ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'', and ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''.<ref name="sale">{{cite news |last=Meier |first=Barry |title=Kermit and Miss Piggy Join Stable of Walt Disney Stars |work=The New York Times |date=February 18, 2004 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905EFDE123DF93BA25751C0A9629C8B63 |accessdate=April 8, 2008}}</ref>  In 2010, it was announced that the first major biography of Henson, sanctioned by the family and the Jim Henson Legacy, was underway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/jim-henson-biography-acquired-by-ballantine_b12261 |author=Jason Boog |date=July 27, 2010 |title=Jim Henson Biography Acquired by Ballantine |deadurl=no |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref> The biography by [[Brian Jay Jones]] was published on September 24, 2013, Henson's 77th birthday.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Brian Jay|title=Jim Henson : the biography|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0345526113}}</ref>  On February 14, 2014, Henson's son, [[John Henson (puppeteer)|John Henson]], died of a heart attack after playing in the snow with his daughter.
