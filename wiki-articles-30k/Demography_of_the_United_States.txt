    As of December 2, 2015, the United States has a total resident population of 322,267,564, making it the third most populous country in the world. It is very urbanized, with 81% residing in cities and suburbs as of 2014 (the worldwide urban rate is 54%). California and Texas are the most populous states, as the mean center of U.S. population has consistently shifted westward and southward. New York City is the most populous city in the United States. The total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2014 is 1.86 children per woman,National Vital Statistics Reports. Births: Preliminary Data for 2014 which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.1. Compared to other Western countries, in 2012, U.S. fertility rate was lower than that of France (2.01), Australia (1.93) and the United Kingdom (1.92). However, U.S. population growth is among the highest in industrialized countries, because the differences in fertility rates are less than the differences in immigration levels, which are higher in the U.S. The United States Census Bureau shows a population increase of 0.75% for the twelve-month period ending in July 2012. Though high by industrialized country standards, this is below the world average annual rate of 1.1%. There were over 158.6 million women in the United States in 2009. The number of men was 151.4 million. At age 85 and older, there were more than twice as many women as men. People under 20 years of age made up over a quarter of the U.S. population (27.3%), and people age 65 and over made up one-eighth (12.8%) in 2009. The national median age was 36.8 years. The United States Census Bureau defines White people as those "having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who reported "White" or wrote in entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish." Whites constitute the majority of the U.S. population, with a total of about 245,532,000 or 77.7% of the population as of 2013. There are 62.6% Whites when Hispanics who describe themselves as "white" are taken out of the calculation. Despite major changes due to illegal and legal immigration since the 1960s and the higher birth-rates of nonwhites, the overall current majority of American citizens are still white, and English-speaking, though regional differences exist. The American population almost quadrupled during the 20th century—at a growth rate of about 1.3% a year—from about 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000. It reached the 200 million mark in 1968, and the 300 million mark on October 17, 2006. Population growth is fastest among minorities as a whole, and according to the Census Bureau's estimation for 2012, 50.4% of American children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups.Morello, Carol and Mellnik, Ted. "Census: Minority Babies Are Now Majority in United States." Washington Post. May 17, 2012. Accessed 2012-05-17. Hispanic and Latino Americans accounted for 48% of the national population growth of 2.9 million between July 1, 2005, and July 1, 2006. Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead. The Census Bureau projects a U.S. population of 417 million in 2060, which is a 38% increase from 2007 (301.3 million). However, the United Nations projects a U.S. population of 402 million in 2050, an increase of 32% from 2007. In an official census report, it was reported that 54.4% (2,150,926 out of 3,953,593) of births in 2010, were non-Hispanic white. This represents an increase of 0.34% compared to the previous year, which was 54.06%.http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_01.pdf     In 1900, when the U.S. population was 76 million, there were 66.8 million Whites in the United States, representing 88% of the total population,"Demographics Trends in the 20th Century".

The United States Census Bureau publishes a popular "dot" or "nighttime" map showing population distribution at a resolution of 7,500 people, as well as complete listings of population density by place name. The United States has dozens of major cities, including 31 "global cities" of all types, with 8 in the "alpha" group of global cities: New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, DC, Boston, San Francisco, Miami and Atlanta. , the United States had 51 metropolitan areas with a population of over 1,000,000 people each. (See Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas.) , about 250 million Americans live in or around urban areas. That means more than three-quarters of the U.S. population shares just about three percent of the U.S. land area. The following table shows the populations of the top twenty metropolitan areas, at the time of the 2010 Census.       The U.S. population's distribution by race and ethnicity in 2010 was as follows; due to rounding, figures may not add up to the totals shown.   Each of the racial categories includes people who identify their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino. U.S. federal law defines Hispanic or Latino as "those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the Census 2000 or ACS questionnaire"—Mexican", "Puerto Rican", or "Cuban"—as well as those who indicate that they are "other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino."" Persons whose ethnicity is identified as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race. The total population of Hispanic and Latino Americans comprised 50.5 million or 16.3% of the national total in 2010.   This is a racial breakdown by the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 5 inhabited territories.  All Data from 2010 U.S. Census Bureau There were 22.1 million veterans in 2009. quoting the Bureau of Labor Statistics In 2010, the Washington Post estimated that there were 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. There were about 2 million people in prison in 2010. The 2000 U.S. Census counted same-sex couples in an oblique way; asking the sex and the relationship to the "main householder", whose sex was also asked. One organization specializing in analyzing gay demographic data reported, based on this count in the 2000 census and in the 2000 supplementary survey, that same-sex couples comprised between 0.99% and 1.13% of U.S. couples in 2000. A 2006 report issued by The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation concluded that the number of same-sex couples in the U.S. grew from 2000 to 2005, from nearly 600,000 couples in 2000 to almost 777,000 in 2005. A 2006 UCLA study reported that 4.1% of Americans aged 18–45 identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. A 2011 report by the Institute estimated that 4 million adults identify as gay or lesbian, representing 1.7% of the population over 18. A spokesperson said that, until recently, few studies have tried to eliminate people who had occasionally undertaken homosexual behavior or entertained homosexual thoughts, from people who identified as lesbian or gay. (Older estimates have varied depending on methodology and timing; see Demographics of sexual orientation for a list of studies.) The American Community Survey from the 2000 U.S. Census estimated 776,943 same-sex couple households in the country as a whole, representing about 0.5% of the population.Gary J. Gates .

A report by the U.S. Census Bureau projects a decrease in the ratio of Whites between 2010 and 2050, from 79.5% to 74.0%. At the same time, Non-Hispanic Whites are projected to no longer make up a majority of the population by 2042, but will remain the largest single ethnic group. In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population.

Approximately 39% are projected to be Hispanic or Latino (up from 22% in 2008), and 38% are projected to be single-race, non-Hispanic Whites (down from 56% in 2008)., U.S. Census Press Releases, 14 August 2008 (archived from the original on 2008-08-22) In 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau projected future censuses as follows:    The table below is based mainly on selected data as reported to the United States Census Bureau. It only includes the voluntary self-reported membership of religious bodies with 750,000 or more. The definition of a member is determined by each religious body.Table No. 68. Religious Bodies—Selected Data (p. 59),  , the US census bureau reported that about 13% of the population did not identify themselves as a member of any religion. In a Pew Research Survey performed in 2012, Americans without a religion (atheists, agnostics, nothing in particular, etc.) surpassed Evangelical Protestant Americans with almost 20% of Americans being nonreligious. If this current growth rate continues, by 2050, around 51% of Americans will not have a religion. A survey conducted in 2014 by the same organization indicated that the percentage of Americans unaffiliated with a religion rose to nearly 23% of the population, up from 16% in 2007.http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ 300px" heights="200 Religious affiliation within each state that has the largest deviation compared to the national average, 2001.

The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461 American residential households in the contiguous United States. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281. Adult respondents were asked the open-ended question, "What is your religion, if any?". Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was "Protestant" or "Christian" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one-third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions. Religious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008Figures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of "no religion" than any other group. In 2010, the median age for marriage for men was 27; for women, 26.  In 2006, the median household income in the United States was around $46,326. Household and personal income depends on variables such as race, number of income earners, educational attainment and marital status.  Social classes in the United States lack distinct boundaries and may overlap. Even their existence (when distinguished from economic strata) is controversial. The following table provides a summary of some prominent academic theories on the stratification of American society:  In 2010, the average man weighed ; the average woman .  The height of an American man was   and woman   The average BMI is 27.3 for males (overweight) and 28.5 for females (overweight). According to a Gallup poll in 2012, an estimated 26% of the population were obese, 21% smoked, and 11% had diabetes. A nationwide study reported by the New York Times in 2010 indicated that 19.5% of teens, aged 12–19, had developed "slight" hearing loss. "Slight" was defined as an inability to hear at 16 to 24 decibels. According to the Centers for Disease Control in 2011, an estimated 1.2 million people were living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.  A study by William Strauss and Neil Howe, in their books Generations and Fourth Turning, looked at generational similarities and differences going back to the 15th century and concluded that over 80-year spans, generations proceed through four stages of about 20 years each. A definitive recent study of US generational cohorts was done by Schuman and Scott (2012) in which a broad sample of adults of all ages was asked, "What world events are especially important to you?"Schuman, H. and Scott, J. (1989), Generations and collective memories, American Sociological Review, vol. 54, 1989, pp.&nbsp;359–81. They found that 33 events were mentioned with great frequency. When the ages of the respondents were correlated with the expressed importance rankings, seven (some put 8 or 9) distinct cohorts became evident. Today the following descriptors are frequently used for these cohorts (alive in 2000–10): Subdivided groups are present when peak boom years or inverted peak bust years are present, and may be represented by a normal or inverted bell-shaped curve (rather than a straight curve). The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as "pre-peak" (including peak year) and "post-peak". The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4.3 million births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a "bust", there are still a relatively large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The Baby boom began around 1943 to 1946. From the decline in U.S. birth rates starting in 1958 and the introduction of the birth-control pill in 1960, the Baby Boomer normal distribution curve is negatively skewed. The trend in birth rates from 1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately 1969, thus returning to pre-WWII levels, with 12 years of rising and 12 years of declining birth rates. Pre-war birth rates were defined as anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber's, Philip M. Hauser and William Fielding Ogburn. The following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.   Median ages are 37.3 years; males are 36.1 years; females are 38.5 years estimated as of 2012.

Generation — born from approximately 1901 to 1924 (depression cohort who fought and won World War II). Silent Generation — born from approximately 1925 to 1942 during the Great Depression and World War II. The label was originally applied to people in North America but has also been applied to those in Western Europe, Australasia and South America. It includes most of those who fought during the Korean War. Baby Boomers — commentators use birth dates ranging approximately from the early 1940s to the early 1960s. Generation X — commentators use birth dates ranging approximately from the early 1960s to the early 1980s. In the U.S., some called Generation Xers the "baby bust" generation because of the drop in the birth rate following the baby boom.Encyclopedia of Identity By Ronald L. Jackson, II The drop in fertility rates in America began in the late 1950s. But according to authors and demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe (who use 1961 to 1981 for Gen X birth years), there are approximately 88.5 million Gen Xers in the U.S. today. The Millennial Generation also known as Generation Y—commentators use beginning birth dates from the early 1980s to the early 2000s. Generation Z—also known as the Homeland Generation or "digital natives" are the cohort of people born after the Millennials. There is no agreement on the exact dates birth dates with some sources starting them at the mid or late 1990s or the more widely used period from the mid 2000s to the present day. This is the generation which is currently being born. 0–14 years: 19.8% (male 31,639,127/female 30,305,704) 15–64 years: 66.8% (male 101,612,000/female 104,577,000) 65 years and over: 13.4% (male 18,332,000/female 23,174,000) (2012 est.)
