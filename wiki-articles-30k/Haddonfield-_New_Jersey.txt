 Not the fictional town from the Halloween film series.  Haddonfield is a borough located in Camden County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough had a total population of 11,593, reflecting a decline of 66 (-0.6%) from the 11,659 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 31 (+0.3%) from the 11,628 counted in the 1990 Census.Table 7.

Haddonfield was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 6, 1875, within portions of Haddon Township following a referendum on the same day. The borough became an independent municipality in 1894.Snyder, John P. The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 106.

The Lenape disappeared from the local area when settlers arrived. Arrowheads and pottery shards have been found by residents by the banks of the Cooper River, hinting that there was a Native American settlement in Haddonfield at one point in time.  On October 23, 1682, Francis Collins, an English Quaker and a bricklayer by trade, became the first settler within the boundaries of what today is Haddonfield. Collins soon built a house, "Mountwell," on a tract of 400 acres.  Haddonfield was further developed by Elizabeth Haddon (1680–1762), whose Quaker father, John Haddon, bought a  tract of land in the English colony of West Jersey to escape religious persecution. Elizabeth set sail alone from Southwark, England to the New World in 1701. Shortly after her arrival, she made a marriage proposal to John Estaugh, a Quaker minister, and they were married in 1702.  The town was named for John Haddon, though he never came to America.Kaplan, Melanie D. G. "Escapes: Haddonfield, N.J., still prohibits liquor sales", The Washington Post, November 4, 2009.

The Borough of Haddonfield -- like 36 other Jersey towns -- is dry. The Indian King was one of the last places to sell alcohol before the town banned liquor. Since 1873, residents of this South Jersey town have bought their spirits in the next burg over and consumed it at home or, more recently, at BYOB restaurants." The Indian King Tavern, built in 1750, played a significant role in the American Revolutionary War.  During that war, the New Jersey Legislature met there, avoiding British forces, and in 1777, declared New Jersey to be an independent state. Today the tavern is a state historical site and museum."Haddonfield: Quaker roots run deep", Courier-Post, October 19, 2006. Accessed June 28, 2007. "In 1777, as armies devastated Trenton during the Revolution, the Assembly reconvened in the Indian King Tavern in Haddonfield and passed legislation creating an independent state....

Haddonfield is a significant historic paleontology site. In 1838, William Estaugh Hopkins uncovered large bones in a marl pit in which he was digging. Hopkins displayed the bones at his home, Birdwood; and these bones sparked the interest of a visitor, William Foulke. In 1858, Foulke dug from the marl pit the first relatively complete skeleton of a dinosaur found in North America, Hadrosaurus foulkii.  The skeleton was assembled in 1868 and is still displayed at Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences.Hadrosaurus foulkii, Academy of Natural Sciences. Accessed February 24, 2012.
