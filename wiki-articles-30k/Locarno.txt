    Locarno (Ticinese: Locarn) is the capital of the Locarno district, located on the northern tip of Lake Maggiore (Lago Maggiore) in the Swiss canton of Ticino, close to Ascona at the foot of the Alps. It has a population of about 15,000 (60,000 for the urban area including Ascona). The official language of Locarno is Italian. It is the 74th biggest city in Switzerland by population and the 3rd biggest of the canton Ticino, after Lugano and Bellinzona. The Locarno International Film Festival takes place every year in August in the city and, at night, on the Piazza Grande. The Locarno Treaties were negotiated here in 1925. In January 2004, the Italian historian Marino Vigano speculated that Locarno's castle may have been designed by Leonardo da Vinci. In 1934 in the vicinity of today's Via S. Jorio, a necropolis with 14 urn graves from the Early Bronze Age (about 14th century BC) were found. Some of the urns were directly buried, while others were placed in boxes of uncut stone. The urns contained, in addition to burned bones, bronze ornaments, which had some fire damage, including, bangles, hair pins with conical head and slightly thickened neck, rings and knives. Similar urns were also discovered in the district of S. Antonio, which was probably also a small cemetery. The ceramic and bronze objects date from the Canegrate culture (named after a large necropolis in the province of Milan). However, no traces of the settlement have been discovered. In 1935, a large necropolis was discovered at Solduno. The over 200 graves cover nearly a thousand years, from the La Tène culture to the 3rd century AD. Many of the La Tène era grave goods (particularly from the 3rd-1st century BC) are Celtic style Fibulae or brooches. These objects demonstrate a cultural influence from regions north of the Alps. However, the ceramic objects are indigenous to Golasecca culture which spread into Ticino and Lombardy. Between 1946-49, a number of Roman era tombs were discovered on the terrace between the churches of S. Maria in Selva and S. Giovanni Battista in Solduno. The Roman city that became Locarno was therefore between the Vicus of Muralto and this cemetery. Unfortunately, intensive construction and agricultural activity have destroyed many traces of the city. In 1995 and 1997, 57 graves were found in Via Valle Maggia. Nineteen were from the Roman period, which confirms that even in the 3rd century cremation and body burials were practiced side by side. Among the significant, a number of glass items were discovered. The Roman necropolis was used from the end of the Latène era until the middle of the 3rd century AD. The Romanization of Locarno wiped out much of the local culture or replaced the rest with Roman elements. However, it appears that there was no Roman ruling class, which could have dominated the local population. The Capitanei, were a group of noble families that led Locarno.  The term is first mentioned in a document granting market rights to the town by Emperor Frederick I in 1164. This title was originally only the direct vassals of the king's fief. The lower vassals were known as valvassores, but could have been awarded the title of Capitanei as a special concession. The Capitanei were probably descendants of the old Lombard noble Da Besozzo family from the county of Seprioio. Around 1000, the family was granted a fief in Locarno by the schismatic Bishop of Como Landolfo da Carcano. The Capitanei were given the right of management of Church property entrusted to the pieve, they had the rights of immunity and coercion, but were not owners of the village cooperatives' (Vicini) land, with the exception of the churches and royal estates. They did not have the right of high justice so their political power was limited. However, they played an important role in the 13th and 14th century conflicts between the Guelphs and Ghibellines and in the wars between Como and Milan. In Locarno, at the Reformation, two of the three great feudal families of capitanei: Muralto and Orelli emigrated to Zürich. A branch of Muralt was established in Bern. The third great family, Magoria, remained in Locarno. The Capitanei retained a role in Locarno's politics until 1798.  In 1803, the lands and rights of the Capitanei were integrated into the political municipality of Locarno.  Starting in the Lombard period (after 569), the area around Locarno (and presumably the town) was part of the county Stazzona and later the Mark of Lombardy.  Locarno is first mentioned in 807 as Leocarni. In German, it came to be known as Luggarus, Lucarius, Lucaris. It is likely that a market existed at or near the lake since the Roman era.  The long history of the town and its location led to the creation of a royal court, which is first mentioned in 866.  During the Middle Ages Locarno and Ascona formed a community, with several, separate neighborhoods.  The community managed its common goods (alpine pastures, pastures, forests, churches) and tax officials and police. In the 10th century, Bishop of Milan began to consolidate more and more power to himself at the expense of the Kings of the Germans.  This expansion by Milan was countered by Henry II, who incorporated Locarno in 1002/04 with the surrounding areas into the Diocese of Como. Friedrich Barbarossa granted extensive market rights to Locarno in 1164 and granted imperial immediacy in 1186. Due to these privileges, Locarno developed substantial local autonomy, which assisted the development of municipal institutions. The nobles (Nobili) lost more and more rights to the citizens (borghesi). By 1224, the borghesi had their own administration and various privileges, including: market rights, the right to their own weights, maintenance of mills and grazing rights in Saleggi, in Colmanicchio (Alp Vignasca) and in the Magadino and Quartino valleys. Locarno was the administrative center of the parish of Locarno.  The Podestà or high government official, resided in the Casa della Gallinazza, which was burned in 1260 during the clashes between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Several Locarno families, including members of the Capitanei di Locarno and Simone da Orello, played an important role in the battles between the two factions. In 1342, Luchino and Giovanni Visconti conquered the area, which brought Locarno back under the power of Milan. In 1439, Count Franchino Rusca was awarded Locarno as a fief. In 1291, a Humiliati monastery was first mentioned in Locarno.  St. Catherine's church, attached to the monastery, probably dates to the mid-14th century.  The rule of the Rusca ended 1503, when the Confederates occupied Locarno, but failed to conquer the Visconti castle. After the battle of Novara in 1513, the French King Louis XII gave the Confederates the castle.  In the Treaty of Freiburg in 1516, they received all of Locarno.  The Twelve Cantons took turns appointing a governor (), to rule over Locarno.  The governor had both civil and criminal jurisdiction, except in certain cases after 1578, where seven judges were elected by the locals to try the cases.  On taking office, the Governor swore under oath to obey the statutes of Locarno.  The Governor was supported by a local mayor, and criminal fines were usually given to local community. The rule of the Twelve Cantons also had an effect on the social and political relations of the town.  In addition to the nobility (representing the three old noble families Orelli, Muralto and Magoria) and citizens, there was a third group.  This third group, the terrieri, was a group of residents who had lived a long time in Locarno, but were not citizens.  Each of the three groups were a statutory corporation, with shared property and a governing body.  Under the Confederation, each of these groups or corporations had representation in the Consiglio Magnifico which ruled Locarno.  However, the town's dominance over the villages in the region, until 1798, is clearly shown in their representation in the Council.  The three groups in Locarno had twelve aldermen (six nobles, four citizens and two terrieri), while all the rural communities together had only eight members. During the Middle Ages, Locarno was centered around the intersection of Via Cittadella and Via S. Antonio.  The town stretched up the slope of the mountain and behind the castle. Some houses lined the shore, and above the Contrada Borghese a small, almost rural settlement grew up.  The center of town was dominated by town houses with their large courtyards and gardens.  The members of the upper class also owned small country houses with vineyards, which went up the hill behind Locarno as well as in Solduno and Cugnasco.  Locarno also had several noble estates during the Late Middle Ages, including the so-called Cittadella.  The buildings of the 17th and 18th Centuries, including the Casa Simona (16th to 18th century), the Casa Rusca from the first half of the 18th century (now the seat of the municipal art gallery) and the Casa del Negromante, were built on older structures and didn't change the layout of the town.   There were several castles from the Early Middle Ages in Locarno.  One was destroyed by the Milanese in 1156.  Another, first mentioned in 1210 as Orelli castle, was occupied in 1342 occupied by the Visconti and enlarged.  This castle came to be known as Visconti Castle.  In 1531, the Confederates demolished much of the castle, leaving only the central core.  The castle was used as the residence of the governor, but in the following centuries, it began to fall apart.  From 1804 to 1909, the castle was the seat of the administrative governor and the District Court.  After 1909, it came into the possession of the city and was renovated in 1921-28.  Since 1920, it houses the city and Archaeological Museum.  In 1507, a defensive bastion or Ravelin was added to protect the castle entrance.  It is likely that Leonardo da Vinci designed this structure.  North-east of the castle is Palazzo Casorella (Casa degli Orelli) from the 16th century.  During the Middle Ages, the economy of Locarno and the whole region was closely linked with the nobles who owned the market, fishing, alpine and grazing rights and tithes. Starting in the 13th century, some of these privileges went to the citizens corporation.  The hill areas were dominated by viticulture, while grain was raised in the plains. Within the town, vegetables and fruits were grown. Artisans and stores were concentrated in the interior of the town. The repeatedly flooded shorelines and the alpine pastures were used for grazing. In the early modern period, Locarno developed into a thriving commercial center on an important road that linked the major cities of Lombardy, with German-speaking Switzerland and Germany. Cereals and salt came from the Lombardy and Piedmont to Locarno, while Locarno and its hinterland (especially the Maggia Valley) provided large quantities of wood and cattle to Italy. The parish church of Locarno, S. Antonio Abate, was first built in 1353-54. It was replaced by the current building in 1664. The decoration of the church was financed, primarily, by the grain traders at the end of the 17th century, and the chapel frescoes are by Giuseppe Antonio Felice Orelli from 1742. The citizens of Locarno had the right to appoint priests at S. Antonio Abate, S. Maria in Selva (consecrated in 1424, since 1884 only the choir and bell tower remain) and SS Trinità dei Monti (consecrated 1621). The church of San Francesco, together with the adjoining convent, were built in the early 13th century. The church's first consecration was probably in 1230, but the first documented consecration of the church was in 1316. It was rebuilt and enlarged between 1538-1675 using construction material from Visconti Castle. San Francesco hosted the meetings of the nobility and the citizens. Starting in the 16th century, the appointed Governor swore his oath in the church. In the 16th century, the Humiliati order was suppressed and St. Catherine's church and monastery closed. All three ruling groups of Locarno agreed to convert the church and monastery into the Hospital S. Carlo. The Hospital remained until 1854 when it closed, due to financial reasons. In the 16th century, Locarno's population declined as a result of exodus of Protestants and the plague in 1576-77. After a recovery in the 17th century, the population declined considerably in the 18th century again. By 1535, there was a Protestant community known as the ecclesia christiana locarnensis in Locarno. They owed their existence to the work of Giovanni Beccaria, several notables of the town (including Taddeo Duni) and religious refugees from Milan and Piedmont. To counteract the tensions, the Protestant community and the Catholic clergy met for a debate on 8 May 1549. At the end of the debate, Beccaria was imprisoned. However, because of protests against his arrest, he was immediately released. In 1550, Locarno declared itself to be a Catholic town, but a large group continued to practice the Protestant faith. However, in 1554, the Diet of Baden issued an ultimatum to the Protestants, either renounce new faith or go into exile. On 3 March 1555, over 100 people left Locarno to emigrate to Zürich. In the course of Counter-Reformation in the 17th century, many religious buildings in Locarno were renewed or rebuilt. These include the 1604 church dedicated to SS Sebastiano e Rocco with the Capuchin monastery and the church of S. Maria Assunta (Chiesa Nuova). Under the Helvetic Republic (1798–1803) Locarno was part of the Canton of Lugano.  Following the collapse of the Helvetic Republic, the Act of Mediation, in 1803, created the Canton of Ticino with Locarno as an independent municipality.  The Helvetic Republic was very liberal and attempted to reform much of Swiss society.  However, the changes were too great and the Republic collapsed.  The compromise Act of Mediation changed some aspects of society but left others unchanged.  The new municipality of Lucarno was no longer ruled by three different patriziati, which had emerged from the three groups (nobles, borghesi and terrieri), but until the mid-19th century there were institutions that reached back to the Ancien Régime.  For example, the community of Locarno and Ascona was dissolved in 1805.  Nevertheless, a "committee of the representatives of the former communities of Locarno" managed, for several decades, the S. Carlo Hospital and schools, which had been shared by the patriziati of the old, combined community.  However, the power of the old patriziati gradually weakened.  In 1859, the terrieri decided to set aside their corporation.  The nobles corporation distributed its assets in 1866-67 to its members and dissolved the archive, but retained until about 1920, the fishing rights. Only the citizens corporation has preserved its status as a civil community. The Constitution of 1814, established Locarno, Bellinzona and Lugano as the capitals of the canton, in a six-year rotation.   Locarno was the capital of the canton in 1821-27, 1839–45, 1857–63 and 1875-81. In 1838-39, on the initiative of a group of notables, a government building was built. It was sold in 1893 to private company. It then became the headquarters of Credito Ticinese and since 1917 it has been the headquarters of the Electricity Company of Sopraceneri.  Locarno was repeatedly the scene of political clashes.  In 1839 and 1841, uprisings against the government broke out. In 1855, a murder in a coffee house was used as a pretext for a coup of radicals (pronunciamento).  Another coup, the Ticino coup of 1890, did nothing to change the balance of power between the parties in the city. After a liberal mayor ruled for 35 consecutive years (1865–80), a conservative mayor ruled for another 36 years (1880–1916). To break the conservative hegemony of the late 19th century, the Social Democrats, allied with the Liberals in 1916 elections.  They succeeded to a majority in the city government (which then consisted of nine members, but in 1987 was limited to seven), which they kept in the following decades. In the 19th century, the population in Locarno grew noticeably compared to neighboring communities. As early as 1836, the immigrant population was over 16% of the population. Between 1860-80, the population fell slightly  mainly because of emigration to California. In the following decades, the growth rates were below those of other population centers of the canton, which, unlike Locarno, benefited directly from the Gotthard railway. In 1816, the special rights and title of the old mother church of San Vittore in Muralto went over to S. Antonio Abate.  In 1863, snow collecting on the roof of the church caused the vault to collapse, killing 40 people.  The citizens collective or borghesi lacked the resources to repair the church.  Therefore, in 1866, the ownership and maintenance of the churches of S. Antonio and S. Maria in Selva were given to the town as a whole.  For financial reasons, the collapsed church was not completely repaired.  Only the façade and central vault were rebuilt and the choir was expanded. Between 1863-74, church of San Francesco had to be used for services, and after 1798, the Assemblies of the neighborhoods, the city and the county were held in the church. In 1814, the church of San Francesco was secularized and the Franciscans had to leave. The church and convent served from 1821 until 1827 as the State Government offices. From 1848-63, the church was closed for worship, and in 1874 it was converted into a barracks and a salt storage. In 1924, it was converted back into a church and used by Benedictines for Catholic services delivered in the German language. The Jesuits took over this task from 1947 until 1992. The monastery was secularized in 1848, and after the 1893-94 renovation, it housed the first high school. Then in 1930 it was used for teacher training. Between 1935-92, the newspaper, L'Eco di Locarno was printed in Locarno.  In 1992, it merged with the official newspaper of the Liberal party Il dovere to create the daily newspaper La Regione. Since 1987, the only German language newspaper in Ticino, the Tessiner Zeitung, is published three times each week in Locarno.  Locarno has an area, , of .

The Astrovia Locarno is a 1 : 1,000,000,000 scale model of the Solar System. The Sun can be found at the end of Via Gioacchino Respini where the cycle path, which runs alongside the river Maggia, starts. Pluto, the final planet in the model, can be found  away from this starting point in the village of Tegna. The sanctuary of Madonna del Sasso in Orselina above the city is the principal sight and goal of pilgrimage in the city. The founding of the sanctuary goes back to a vision of the Virgin Mary that the Franciscan brother Bartolomeo d'Ivrea experienced in the night of 14/15 August 1480. The interior is highly decorated, and a platform gives a magnificent view of the city. The Locarno–Madonna del Sasso funicular links Locarno city centre with the Madonna del Sasso sanctuary and Orselina. From Orselina, an cable car operates to the top of Cardada (el. ), and a chair lift goes further to the top of Cimetta (el. ). Castello Visconteo, on the edge of the old town, was built in the 12th century, probably as the residence of a Captain Orelli, who remained true to the Emperor. In 1260, it fell into the hands of the Ghibellines. In 1342 the Visconti of Milan, for whom it is now named, attacked the castle from both the land and the lake side and took it. It first came into the hands of the Eidgenossen in 1503. Today, only a fifth of the original structure remains. Most of that dates from the 15th and 16th centuries. Only the foundation remains from the original structure. In the 2007 federal election the most popular party was the FDP which received 34.88% of the vote.
