    is a Japanese animation studio which is majority owned by Toei Company, Ltd. The studio was founded in 1948 as . In 1956, Toei purchased the studio and it was reincorporated under its current name. Over the years, the studio has created a large number of TV series, movies, and adapted many Japanese comics by renowned authors to animated series, many popular worldwide. Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, Leiji Matsumoto and Yoichi Kotabe have all worked with the company in the past. Toei is a shareholder in the Japanese anime satellite television network, Animax, along with other noted anime studios and production enterprises such as Sunrise, TMS Entertainment and Nihon Ad Systems Inc.[ ][ ]  The company headquarters are located in the Ohizumi Studio in Nerima, Tokyo.[ ] Until 1998, the company was known as  (although even at that time the company's formal English name was "Toei Animation Co., Ltd."), with "dōga" being the native Japanese word for "animation" which was widely used until the 1970s. Their mascot is the cat Pero, from the company's 1969 film adaptation of Puss in Boots. Toei Animation produced the anime versions of works by many legendary manga artists, including Go Nagai (Mazinger Z), Eiichiro Oda (One Piece), Shotaro Ishinomori (Cyborg 009), Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro (Toriko), Takehiko Inoue (Slam Dunk), Mitsuteru Yokoyama (Sally the Witch), Masami Kurumada (Saint Seiya), Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump), Leiji Matsumoto (Galaxy Express 999), and of course Naoko Takeuchi (Sailor Moon). In addition, the studio helped propel the popularity of the Magical Girl and Super Robot genres of anime; among Toei's most legendary and trend-setting TV series include the first magical girl anime series of all time, Mahoutsukai Sally the anime adaptation of Mitsuteru Yokoyama's manga of the same name, and Go Nagai's Mazinger Z, animated adaptation of his manga, which set the standard for Super Robot anime for years to come, Toei Animation was the launching pad for such iconic characters in both Japan and North America, like Golion a.k.a. Lion Voltron, Mantaro Kinnuku a.k.a. Kid Muscle, Usagi Tsukino a.k.a. Serena Tsukino, Monkey D. Ruffy a.k.a. Monkey D. Luffy, The Cybertrons a.k.a. The Autobots, Gash Bell a.k.a. Zatch Bell, and of course Son Goku a.k.a. Goku. Although Toei Company usually lets Toei Animation handle its official animation works, on occasion they may hire other companies to provide animation on their behalf, such as the Robot Romance Trilogy in which Toei Company handled the overall production, but the animation work went to Sunrise (then known as Nippon Sunrise) instead. Anime created by Toei Animation that have won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award have been Galaxy Express 999 in 1981, Saint Seiya in 1987, and Sailor Moon in 1992. In addition to producing anime for domestic release in Japan, Toei Animation also provided animation work for several American box office motion pictures and television series for US companies, dating back as far as the 1960s, but they mostly provided outsourced production work during the 1980s. Animated productions done by foreign studios, dubbed in Japanese by the studio. The following is a list of TV shows, movies and specials that were designed and developed at American companies such as Sunbow, Marvel, Hanna-Barbera, DiC, Rankin/Bass, etc. The in-between animation was commissioned from Toei Animation on the behalf of these companies and thus copyright of these shows never belonged to Toei. One exception, Voltron, which was based on a Toei original series, was commissioned by World Events Productions to own the dub to the existing episodes as well as to retain ownership of the new exclusive American episodes and the Fleet of Doom special. A similar thing occurred in regards to Kinikkuman Nisei when new episodes were produced for its American equivalent; Ultimate Muscle, in which those episodes are owned currently by 4Licensing Corporation. At other times, Toei would also outsource itself to fellow Japanese studios to aid in their productions.
