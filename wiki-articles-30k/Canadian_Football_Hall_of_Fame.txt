    The Canadian Football Hall of Fame is a not-for-profit corporation, located in Hamilton, Ontario, that celebrates great achievements in Canadian football. It is an open to the public institution. It includes displays about the Canadian Football League, Canadian university football and Canadian junior football history.The Canadian Encyclopedia It includes a gift shop and the Hall recently opened a website. The main feature of the Hall is the central portion of the museum where inducted members, each with a metal bust depicting their head, are displayed. There are also featured displays that highlight each Canadian Football League team's history, and an interactive field goal kicking exhibit. Once during every CFL season, the Hall sponsors the induction ceremony of former players. Included in the "Hall of Fame Weekend" is a regular season game, usually (but not always) affiliated with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Traditionally, the inducted players will come to the Hall and make an acceptance speech in front of the building where their newly sculpted bust is unveiled. A player must be retired from the game for at least three years before being eligible for consideration.Canadian Football Hall of Fame Nomination Form, April 12, 2010 A Hall of Fame voting committee is composed of sports writers, selected CFL executives and inducted members.Canadian Football Hall of Fame Selection Committee,  Accessed February 2011 The Canadian Hall of Fame officially opened on November 28, 1972. It is located in downtown Hamilton, beside the former Hamilton City Hall and Family Courts Building, which is inside the former Andrew Carnegie library on Main Street, between Bay Street and MacNab Street. The Canadian Hall of Fame was awarded to the City of Hamilton in June 1963 following the invitation of Mayor Lloyd Douglas Jackson. The Hamilton Parks Board offered a space near Civic Stadium. Ivan Miller, former sports editor of The Spectator, was named the first curator. Soon after, the Board of Education purchased the land and building. The Hall moved to its current location in 1972. The Canadian Hall of Fame is easily identified by the slightly-larger-than-life metal sculpture Touchdown, featuring a successful receiver being tackled. Currently, the Canadian Football Hall of Fame has honoured over two hundred inductees: sixty-two in the Builders category and one hundred and forty-seven players.Canadian Football Hall of Fame website.
