The board operates in a legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city).

As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process, and holds public hearings on various agenda items. As of 2008, the Board of Supervisors oversees a $22.5 billion annual budget and approximately 100,000 employees.William T Fujioka, "Department Section," County of Los Angeles, Annual Report 2007-2008, 4.

Technically it is a state-mandated county transportation commission that also operates bus and rail. Los Angeles County has voted for the Democratic candidate in most of the presidential elections in the past four decades, although it did vote twice for Dwight Eisenhower (1952, 1956),  Richard Nixon (1968, 1972), and Ronald Reagan (1980, 1984) the latter two of whom were Californians.

Both are headquartered in a large cluster of government buildings in the city's Civic Center. Historically, the courthouses were county-owned buildings that were maintained at county expense, which created significant friction since the trial court judges, as officials of the state government, had to lobby the county Board of Supervisors for facility renovations and upgrades.  In turn, the state judiciary successfully persuaded the state Legislature to authorize the transfer of all courthouses to the state government in 2008 and 2009 (so that judges would have direct control over their own courthouses).  Courthouse security is still provided by the county government under a contract with the state. Unlike the largest city in the United States, New York City, all of the city of Los Angeles and most of its important suburbs are located within a single county.  As a result, both the county superior court and the federal district court are respectively the busiest courts of their type in the nation.A look at your Superior Court, Public Information Office, Los Angeles Superior Court Many celebrities like O. J. Simpson have been seen in Los Angeles courts. In 2003, the television show Extra (based in nearby Glendale) found itself running so many reports on the legal problems of local celebrities that it spun them off into a separate show, Celebrity Justice. State cases are appealed to the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District, which is also headquartered in the Civic Center, and then to the California Supreme Court, which is headquartered in San Francisco but also hears argument in Los Angeles (again, in the Civic Center). Federal cases are appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which hears them at its branch building in Pasadena. The court of last resort for federal cases is the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C.
