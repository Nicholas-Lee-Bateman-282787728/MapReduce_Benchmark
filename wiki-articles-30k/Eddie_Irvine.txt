He was the runner-up in 1999 Formula One World Drivers' Championship, driving for Ferrari. Irvine was influenced by his parents to enter motor racing. He began his career at the age of seventeen when he entered the Formula Ford Championship achieving early success, before progressing to the Formula Three and Formula 3000 Championships. He first drove in Formula One with the Jordan team in 1993 season, where he achieved early notoriety for his involvement in incidents during his early career. He clinched his first podium finish in  before moving to Ferrari in . His most successful season was in  when he took four victories and challenged McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen for the World Championship, eventually finishing the runner-up. He moved to Jaguar in  and endured poor results but managed to clinch his team's first podium in  and another podium in . Irvine left Jaguar due to friction within his team and announced his retirement from competitive motorsport when he did not secure a race seat. Since leaving motorsport, Irvine became a media personality in Britain. He was also linked with the takeover of the Jordan and Minardi teams in 2005, with talks coming to nothing. Irvine also expanded his interests into the property market, having built up an investment during his racing career.  Irvine was born on 10 November 1965 in Newtownards, County Down in Northern Ireland, to Edmund Sr. and Kathleen. He spent his childhood in the village of Conlig. He has one older sister, Sonia who acted as Irvine's physiotherapist until 1999. He completed studies in high school Regent House Grammar School, without ever excelling particularly in the results. Irvine's first taste of motorsport came when his family spent their holidays attending the British Grand Prix. His father also raced in single-seater cars for fun. Irvine originally expressed interest in motorcycles but his father thought them too dangerous. Irvine worked unpaid in his father's scrapyard, in return for which his father funded his racing hobby. He later listed John Watson as his childhood hero. Irvine began to compete with racing cars in 1983, encouraged by his father; Irvine was initially interested in motorcycle racing, but his parents thought the sport too dangerous and so was forced to engage in the Formula Ford. After participating in some races, in 1984 he won his first race at Brands Hatch, occasion which also won the award for best pilot. In 1987, he signed a contract with the Van Diemen team and in that year he managed to win the title of the category, the Formula Ford Festival and the RAC Formula Ford series. At the end of the season, he participated, during the winter, in a test organised by Marlboro in which the winner would get a place in British Formula 3; Irvine set the fastest time and ensured the participation in the championship series of the aforementioned automobile. During this season not won any success and ended the season in fifth place. He also attended the Macau Grand Prix, part of the league schedule of Formula Three, succeeding from the pole position, but did not win the race. Thanks to Marlboro could also take part, the following year, the championship of F3000 with the team Pacific Racing. Flanked by JJ Lehto, considered then a young promise of motoring, managed to finish in ninth place ahead of his teammate, thirteenth. In 1990 he signed a contract to race in Formula 3000 with the team Jordan. During the season, won a victory in Germany and ended the season in third place, with results better than his teammates Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Emanuele Naspetti. At year end, he took part again at Macau Grand Prix and the  Fuji F3 Cup , finishing on the podium both races. The end of the season coincided, however, with the end of the relationship with the Irish team and Irvine moved to Japan to compete in Formula Nippon. During 1991, Irvine raced for Cerumo Racing where he clinched one victory with 17 points scored to finish seventh in the Drivers' Championship. Irvine first appeared in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1992 SARD driving a Toyota Group C car alongside Roland Ratzenberger and Eje Elgh. The team finished ninth overall and came second in the Group C class. Irvine entered Formula One, the highest category of circuit racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body, with the Jordan team, as team-mate to Rubens Barrichello. Making his début at the Japanese Grand Prix, Irvine finished in the points scoring positions with sixth place. He immediately became notable when he held up McLaren driver Ayrton Senna for a number of laps. After the race, Senna walked into the Jordan motorhome and punched Irvine in the face. Irvine retired from the final race in Australia when he suffered an accident. Overall, Irvine finished 22nd in the Drivers' Championship scoring one point. Irvine remained at Jordan for 1994 and was again partnered by Barrichello. At the opening round in Brazil, Irvine was involved in a four car pile-up. He later received a one-race ban and a $10,000 fine by the race stewards. Irvine appealed against the decision to the FIA who decided to reject the appeal on 6 April and increased the penalty to a three-race ban. His seat was filled by Aguri Suzuki for the following Pacific Grand Prix and Andrea de Cesaris for the races in San Marino and Monaco. Irvine returned for the Spanish Grand Prix where he scored his first points scoring position of the season with sixth place, although he suffered consecutive retirements in the following five races. He was unable to finish the Belgian Grand Prix due to an alternator failure, although he was classified 13th due to having completed over 90% of the race distance; Irvine later did not finish the race held in Italy due to an engine failure and was later given a one-race ban, suspended for three races for an first-lap incident with Lotus driver Johnny Herbert during the race. Irvine garnered further controversy during the first qualifying session of the Portuguese Grand Prix when he clipped Williams driver Damon Hill. Irvine was warned a similar incident would see his Super Licence revoked. He finished seventh in the race and took consecutive points scoring finishes in the next two races—fourth at the European Grand Prix and fifth at the Japanese Grand Prix. Irvine retired from the season closing race in Australia when he spun off. He finished the year 16th in the Drivers' Championship, with 6 points. Outside of Formula One, Irvine participated in his third consecutive 24 Hours of Le Mans driving for SARD alongside Mauro Martini and Jeff Krosnoff. The team finished second overall and took victory in the LMP1/C90 class having led for 90 minutes and were forced to slow due to an gearbox issue.  Irvine remained at Jordan for  and was again partnered by Barrichello. He endured a bad start: Irvine was forced into retirement at the opening race held in Brazil due to an gearbox actuator problem, and in the following race in Argentina, he made contact with McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen's left rear tyre and retired with an engine failure after six laps. He managed to finish in eighth at the San Marino Grand Prix and took his first points scoring finish by clinching fifth position in Spain. After retiring from the Monaco Grand Prix, Irvine secured the first podium of his Formula One career with third place in Canada. Despite this success, Irvine did not score points in the following seven races. At the Belgian Grand Prix, Irvine's car caught fire during a pitstop as the fuel valve was jammed open and was forced to retire. In the week before the European Grand Prix, Jordan announced that Irvine would be retained on a two-year contract. However, Ferrari then announced that it had brought out Irvine's contract, and that he would be partnering Michael Schumacher at the team for 1996. He fared well in the race by finishing sixth, although he finished outside of the points in the Pacific Grand Prix. Irvine scored his final points of the season with a fifth in Japan and finished the season with a retirement due to pneumatic pressure in Australia. He finished the year 12th in the Drivers' Championship with 10 points scored.  At the first race in Australia, Irvine clinched third position; in the following round held in Brazil, he finished outside of the points scoring positions with seventh position and took fifth in Argentina. At the European Grand Prix, he struggled with the handling of his car and was involved in an incident with Olivier Panis causing both drivers to retire. Irvine took fourth in the San Marino Grand Prix. However, Irvine endured with unreliability from his car and was forced to retire from the next eight consecutive races, due to being involved in incidents or problems with his car. The streak was ended when Irvine finished fifth in the Portuguese Grand Prix although he suffered another retirement at the season closing race in Japan. Irvine finished tenth in the Drivers' Championship with 11 points. The first race of the season in Australia saw Irvine involved in a crash with Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve. The incident created controversy as it caused an rift with Irvine that lasted throughout the season. Irvine took 16th place at the next race held in Brazil, having found his car difficult to drive, and secured an second-place finish in Argentina two weeks later where Irvine challenged Villeneuve for victory who was suffering from a stomach ailment and his car developed brake problems. The result had ended demands in the Italian press for Irvine's to be sacked. He maintained his form by clinching consecutive third place podium finishes in the following two races. This was cut short when Irvine retired from the Spanish Grand Prix where he garnered criticism from Panis and Jean Alesi. At the next race held in Canada Irvine was involved in an incident alongside McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen on the first lap. He managed to recover by clinching another podium finish in France, although this was short lived as Irvine's form dipped when he finished outside of the points scoring positions in the following seven races. During the summer, it was announced that Irvine would remain at Ferrari for 1998. His run of poor results was ended with a third-place finish at the Japanese Grand Prix, and concluded the season with an fifth place at the European Grand Prix. Irvine finished seventh in the Drivers' Championship with 24 points.  Irvine remained at Ferrari for  and was again partnered with Schumacher. Irvine's fitness level was placed in doubt when he suffered from back pain. To combat the issue, a new seat was installed in his car. Irvine had very little testing of his team's car, the Ferrari F300, during pre-season testing and was concerned over the tyre war between Bridgestone and Goodyear but was confident about his chances over the coming season. At the first race of the season in Australia, Irvine finished in fourth and in the following race held in Brazil he clinched eighth position. After these results, Irvine endured a good half of the season as he finished on the podium six times in the next eight races, which included an retirement in Spain when he was involved in a collision with Benetton driver Giancarlo Fisichella which created controversy. He managed to finish second place in France behind team-mate Schumacher which was the first one-two finish for Ferrari in eight years. In July, it was announced Irvine had signed an two-year extension to his contract. The contract stipulated that Irvine was permitted to choose his own strategy and setup, although he would remain a supporting role to Schumacher. After two retirements in the next three races, Irvine recovered to finish second in Italy and secured fourth position at the Luxembourg Grand Prix. He closed off the season with a second-place finish in Japan. Irvine finished the season fourth in the Drivers' Championship and scored 47 points.  For 1999, Irvine was confident heading into the season, saying: "After last year's results where I got my best ever championship finish with 4th place overall, now, for this year, I want to do even better". His season got off to a good start: Irvine clinched his maiden Formula One victory at the season opening round in Australia; and in the following race in Brazil, he secured fifth position despite an unscheduled pitstop. Three weeks later in the San Marino Grand Prix, Irvine's car suffered an engine failure after 46 laps and lost the lead of the World Drivers' Championship to team-mate Schumacher. He managed to clinch his second podium finish of the season in the following round in Monaco. Irvine followed the result by clinching third place in the next round in Canada despite a collision with McLaren driver David Coulthard and set the fastest lap. At the British Grand Prix where Irvine clinched second place, Schumacher crashed after going off the high-speed Stowe Corner when his car's rear brake failed, resulting in a broken leg. Irvine assumed the role as his team's lead driver and was partnered by Finnish driver Mika Salo for the next six races. Nevertheless, Irvine clinched consecutive victories in Austria and Germany where he regained the lead of the Drivers' Championship. and clinched a further podium finish in Hungary where he struggled with oversteer on his car. However, Irvine and Salo had complained about the lack of development with the team's car with Irvine threatening to leave Ferrari if his championship bid was not fully supported. Nevertheless, Irvine clinched consecutive points scoring finishes in the next two races—fourth in Belgium and sixth in Italy. In September, it was announced that Irvine would move to the Jaguar team which had purchased the Stewart team in June and would be partnered by Johnny Herbert. Irvine finished seventh in the European Grand Prix after enduring a 48-second pitstop as one of his wet weather tyres had been misplaced and was placed under pressure from rival Mika Häkkinen. At the penultimate round in Malaysia, Irvine clinched his fourth victory of the season although he and Schumacher were later disqualified as it was discovered their car's bargeboards did not comply to Formula One's technical regulations. Ferrari appealed to the FIA which was heard on 22 October. The following day, it was announced that the Court of Appeal overturned the decision ensuring a last race showdown. At the season closing round in Japan, Irvine crashed out of qualifying and only managed to finish third in the race losing the Drivers' Championship to Häkkinen by 2 points. However Irvine's efforts during the season helped Ferrari to clinch their first Constructors' Championship in 16 years. Irvine was awarded the Hawthorn Memorial Trophy, an annual award given to the most successful British or Commonwealth driver in Formula One over the course of one season. He was also named Autosport's British Competition Driver of the Year for 1999.  Former British racing driver Stirling Moss aired doubts over Irvine's hopes to be a championship contender at Jaguar over the coming season. Former British World Drivers' Champion Jackie Stewart, said: "He really has come together. He's been in the shadow of a number one driver at Ferrari. I think it was time that he shed that shadow and went on to race for himself." Irvine endured a torrid start: At the opening two races held in Australia and Brazil, Irvine suffered consecutive retirements due to spinning out. However, he later managed to finish in the next three races, albeit outside of the points scoring positions. He retired from the European Grand Prix from a collision with Williams driver Ralf Schumacher after spinning from being overtaken by Arrows driver Jos Verstappen. At the next race in Monaco, Irvine scored Jaguar's first points with fourth place. He was forced to withdraw from the Austrian Grand Prix due to abdominal pains caused by a bout of appendicitis although he participated in the event's first free practice session. He was replaced by the team's test driver Luciano Burti. Irvine was passed fit for the German Grand Prix, where he secured tenth position despite a spin. He was unable to score further points in the next five races, which included a retirement in Italy when he collided with Salo on the first lap. He finished off the season by finishing the final three races which included a points scoring finish at the season closing Malaysian Grand Prix where he finished sixth. Irvine finished the season 13th in the Drivers' Championship and scored four points. Outside of Formula One, Irvine took part in the Belfast City Open and Direct Millennium Motorsport Festival driving a Jaguar sportscar to celebrate the marque's participation in the Tourist Trophy.  Irvine remained at Jaguar for 2001 and was partnered by Luciano Burti. Despite his vocal frustrations, Jaguar team principal Bobby Rahal backed Irvine for the upcoming season, although Irvine was not confident citing his uncertainty about his team becoming competitive. Rahal became concerned over Irvine's attitude when the team's car, the Jaguar R2, was underperforming during pre-season testing. Irvine supported the view of being sacked at the end of the season if his performances did not satisfy the team. Irvine clinched 11th place in the first round in Australia and failed to finish in the next four consecutive races. Before the Spanish Grand Prix, Burti left Jaguar to join the Prost team so Irvine was partnered with Pedro de la Rosa. Irvine managed to finish the Austrian Grand Prix in seventh position and took Jaguar's first podium finish with third place in the following round in Monaco. In June, it was confirmed that Irvine and de la Rosa would be retained by Jaguar for 2002. Despite this success, Irvine failed to finish five of the next eight races. He suffered from a neck strain at a test session at Silverstone and took time resting during the summer break. During this period, Rahal attempted to sell Irvine to the Jordan team with an additional $10&nbsp;million to Irvine's salary. Irvine rejected the contract as he wanted to help Jaguar become more competitive. The contract, originally mooted by Rahal as a joke, led to his sacking and he was replaced by Austrian World Champion Niki Lauda. At the Belgian Grand Prix, Irvine was involved in a collision with Burti who was trying to overtake him. Burti crashed at over 240kph and absolved any blame placed upon Irvine. Irvine managed to clinch his final points of the season with fifth in the United States and ended the season by retiring from the Japanese Grand Prix from a failure of his car's power generators on the fuel rig. Irvine finished the season 12th in the Drivers' Championship having scored six points.  Irvine remained at Jaguar for 2002 and was again partnered by de la Rosa. In preparation for the upcoming season, Irvine undertook a fitness examination and recorded a high score. However, he was cautious about his team's prospects going into the year, saying: "We've just got to wait and see what happens with this car, that's the question mark". At the opening round in Australia, Irvine finished fourth; and in the following race in Malaysia, he was forced to retire with an hydraulics problem. Irvine later managed to clinch seventh place in the Brazilian Grand Prix, before he suffered consecutive retirements in the next three races. He later finished the Monaco Grand Prix in ninth position, which was followed up with further consecutive retirements in the seven races. However, this marked a turning point as Irvine managed to finish in all of the remaining races. He was in the points scoring positions twice in this period—a sixth-place finish in Belgium and took his final career podium with third in Italy. He finished the season ninth in the Drivers' Championship, with eight points. During the season, friction developed between Irvine and his team due to his vocal frustration at the lack of development of his car. In an effort to retain Irvine, Jaguar offered him a $6&nbsp;million reduction in his salary, however no agreement was reached. He considered a return to his former team Jordan for the 2003 season, with no agreement reached due to the team's financial problems. Irvine also denied rumours that he would move into either the CART World Series or the IndyCar Series.  In 2002, Irvine successfully sued TalkSport Radio for "passing off" his image in a print advertisement, as if he had personally endorsed the station.Irvine v Talksport. EWHC 367 (Ch). Eight years later, Irvine will front a half-hour programme on the station, the LG Grand Prix Show, alongside regular Sunday evening presenter Andy Goldstein. On 24 July 2003, Irvine was arrested after being caught driving a scooter over 30&nbsp;mph through Hyde Park without a licence or insurance. He was to be sentenced at Bow Street Magistrates but Irvine did not attend. An arrest warrant with bail was issued. Irvine played himself in the 2004 comedy The Prince and Me, which starred Julia Stiles. He is now executive producer of a film being produced about Paddy Mayne."Who Blair Wins" By: Kelleher, Lynne The Sunday Mirror 18 June 2006 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20060618/ai_n16490721 In late 2006 he launched a new television programme on the Sky One channel, with two teams of celebrity racing drivers competing against each other. David Coulthard was captain and coach of the girls team, and Irvine of the boys. Ultimately, despite some impressive performances by both teams, Irvine's team won by some margin. In May 2005, Irvine was rumormed to be heading a consortium to buy the Jordan team and stated his interest of running the team. He was later linked to a possible sale of the Minardi team and held talks with team principal Paul Stoddart. He was a millionaire through property investment before reaching Formula One. Outside of F1, Irvine is said to have built up a multi-million pound property portfolio, owning around forty properties throughout the world. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, published in April 2006, Irvine was the fifth richest person of Northern Ireland at that time, having increased his personal fortune to approximately £160&nbsp;million. He is also the owner of Eddie Irvine Sports, a snooker, pool, kart racing, paintballing, and football facility in Bangor, close to his native Conlig. In May 2006, it was announced that Irvine would be one of the celebrities taking part in ITV's Soccer Aid. In aid of UNICEF, this television show featured an England vs the rest of the world football match, with teams made up of a mix of celebrities and ex-professionals. Unfortunately, he had to pull out because of a leg injury. On 9 January 2014, Irvine was sentenced to six months in prison after being found guilty of "mutual injury" following a brawl in a night club in Milan, Italy with Gabriele Moratti, son of former mayor of Milan Letizia Moratti. Moratti's lawyer, Vincenzo Saponara, told the media that the sentence was likely to be suspended and that neither man would go to jail.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25672557 By virtue of being born in Northern Ireland, a constituent country of the United Kingdom, Irvine was a British citizen throughout his career. He also held a racing licence issued by the National Sporting Authority of the Republic of Ireland. (Drivers are not compelled to obtain their licence from their home country.) The FIA's International Sporting Regulations state that drivers competing in FIA World Championships shall compete under the nationality of their passport, rather than that of the National Sporting Authority that issued their racing licence, as is the case in other racing series.FIA international sporting regulations para 112 This situation created some confusion as to Irvine's nationality when he appeared at podium ceremonies in the Formula One World Championship. At his third podium, a second place for Ferrari at the 1997 Argentine Grand Prix, an Irish Tricolour was mistakenly flown by the race organisers.Ramsey, Chris. Eddie's flag of convenience! The Sun (London, England) 26 April 1997 This led to his family receiving threatening phone calls. Irvine then requested that at subsequent races, a politically neutral shamrock flag be flown, and the non-sectarian Londonderry Air be played to mark a victory.Villeneuve backs return to 'real racetracks' The Independent. Published 25 April 1997. Retrieved 21 March 2008. An FIA spokesman said:  Irvine has self-identified as being Irish:  He became known for his flirting with various women, including Pamela Anderson. Irvine named his biggest influence as his former girlfriend Maria Drummond whom he met at the Macau Grand Prix in 1988. The pair remained friends for a year, staying in regular contact and the relationship became deeper when Drummond split up from her boyfriend. From the relationship Irvine has a daughter, Zoe. He said that the birth of his daughter was the best moment of his life despite not being a natural lover of babies. Irvine is seen by many as a playboy in the mould of James Hunt, in contrast to the sport's modern stars, who are seen as staid and less flamboyant. Irvine is also remembered for his tendency to speak his mind, often to the irritation of some. Despite this, Irvine does not consider himself to be a playboy stating his life is "90% work". He was nicknamed "Irv the Swerve" and later "Fast Eddie". (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap.)
