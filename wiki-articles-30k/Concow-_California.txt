  Concow (formerly, Con Cow) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) of 700 people in Butte County, California, United States. It is named after the Native American tribe that is indigenous to the area, the Concow Maidu [ ]. The original inhabitants ate salmon from the Feather River, acorns and pine nuts, venison, nō-kōm-hē-i'-nē, and other sources of food which abounded in the California foothills. "In the beginning Wahno-no-pem, the Great Spirit, made all things. Before he came, everything on the earth and in the skies was hidden in darkness and in gloom, but where he appeared he was the light. From his essence, out of his breath, he made the sun, the moon, and the countless stars, and pinned them in the blue vault of the heavens."http://www.maidu.com/ourhistory/ethno-history.html There is no indication that there was external governance of the Concow region or the tribal peoples that inhabited the region during the 1697–1821 Spanish colonization or the 1821–1846 Mexican era, characterized by the spread of Californio slave ranchos. The Concow region is 20 miles north of the city of Oroville (an Anglo-Hispanic compound meaning 'gold-town') and about the same distance east of the town of Chico; named for Rancho Arroyo Chico—meaning 'little creek ranch.' Rancho Arroyo Chico was established through a land-grant from the Mexican authorities in 1844, two years before California was invaded by United States forces, an indication that there was some Mexican governance near the Concow region, but no indication of governance of the region. Aside from governance, starting in 1828, northern trappers including Jedediah Smith, Michel Laframboise, and John Work first made contact with the Concow region Maidu.History of the ConCow  Maidu, last accessed 9/27/2011. http://www.maidu.com/maiduculture/firstcontactto1863.html In 1851 the Beckwourth_Trail established the first transportation route to the Concow region.

Their fictionalized but true in spirit story is told by the real person Ishi, who may have been part or full Maidu. Ishi was from the Concow region.  Permanent settlements soon followed and by 1856 several were well established. The growth of these settlements increased after Charles Curtis constructed a toll bridge (1858) across the Feather River at Nelson's Bar and the next year (1859) an additional bridge was constructed by residents of Whiskey Town over the Feather River just North of the Concow region. Basically, there was a Northernly trail and bridge from present day Oroville, and a Southernly trail and bridge from present day Magalia. After a decade of genocide and forcible removals, in 1859 the last of the Kon Kow peoples were forcibly removed by Tehama County ranchers as part of a larger four county 'roundup.'http://yankeehillhistory.com/11%20Oct%20news.pdf They were held at the Mendocino Reservation until the California Reservation Administration at the camp collapsed due to lack of funding due to the Civil War occurring on the East Coast. The Kon Kow were then deported to the Nome Cult Farms at the Round Valley reservation.  By 1862 the last of the native Concow inhabitants were starving on the cramped Round Valley with unrelated people relocated from surrounding regions. The damp coastal climate on the reservation contrasts with the dry climate of the California 'Gold Country' they are accustomed to. It was the midst of the North American Civil War and federal funds for California Reservations were no longer arriving. In the cooling weather of late September, on September 24, 1862, a combination of the poor camp conditions, forced participation in a massacre of the local Wailaki peoples, warnings by local whites that they were planning to massacre the reservation inhabitants that winter, and an imminent winter disaster under the supervision of indian agent James Shortnotes, page 787 note 3006, last accessed 9/27/2011. http://www.csuchico.edu/lbib/spc/bleyhl/Bleyhl_700-874.pdf forced a group of over 400 men, women, children, and elderly to set out with Tome-ya-nem, without provisions, for the 130 miles back to their home in the Concow Valley: a 10-day hike for well equipped healthy young adults.http://www.maidu.com/images/Ghosted.pdf, last accessed 10/23/2011 They made it as far as present day Chico where Agent Hanson had made an agreement with John Bidwell to stop and encamp the Kon Kow people at Bidwell's old river landing - now under Lake Oroville - under the supervision of Sub Agent Eddy and employed for $.10 per hour ($2.72 2013US) constructing the Chico-Humboldt road and providing labor for various employers in the area. The following spring three young children were attacked with the two boys killed and the kidnapped girl escaping after being forced to walk to a village near present day Concow in what became known as the Pence massacre, the murders were within the present day Concow CDP and 9 miles from Concow Valley - the KonKow people were blamed.Butte County CA Archives History - Books .....Indian Difficulties 1882, https://web.archive.org/web/20120421042535/http://files.usgwarchives.org/ca/butte/history/1882/historyo/indiandi55nms.txtIshi the Last Yahi: A Documentary History  By Robert F.

All indications are that the children were kidnapped by a small group of native young men. In the following days 611 KonKow people were murdered by a vigilante volunteer posse of 500 white men that sought to kill every non-white in Butte County. M.H. Wells hid 50 Kon Kows in his Yankee Hill store in the foothills above the camp at Bidwell's old river crossing; the vigilante group discovered these people. In a compromise the vigilantes inspected these people and determined four as 'bad people,' they were tied together in pairs and given a running start before the vigilantes opened fire, the rest were taken to the camp - two of the four were shot and killed.

Despite efforts by the soldiers and the Pence resolution mandated donations of food and shelter provisions, horses and wagons, each day those who could not make the march through the hot arid early September Sacramento Valley - where afternoon temperatures top 90&nbsp;°F or over the 6,000 foot crest of the North Coast Ranges - were left behind without food or water and were soon killed by a pack of wild boar that formed behind and followed the group; the survivors were told to stay at the Round Valley concentration camp or be shot on sight. They were given no provisions by the soldiers and starved to death during the winter. In 1864 a band of Kon Kow Maidu left the Round Valley reservation and again headed back to their home. The reservation agent sent a letter to the Concow post office noting their departure and that they seemed 'hostile.' What became of this band is not known, the following year in August a group of 25 Kon Kow were attacked and killed after a robbery that included two murders at the Robert Workman home; this became known as the Three Knolls Massacre and is seen as a smaller episode of the Mill Creek War.http://www.norcalblogs.com/yahi/2012/06/07/chapter-14-concow-and-the-thre/ And the following year in February, another 5 Kon Kow were killed as continued retribution for the previous years murders. The current inhabitants of Concow, including a few Maidus, commonly find relics of the Maidu in the form of beads and stone tools while digging in and around their homes. In the Concow Lake Valley there is no monument, plaque, or other recognition to memorialize the fate of the KonKow people - few if any of the current inhabitants know. While a post office operated at Concow from 1882 to 1906, renamed from Con Cow to Concow in 1895, and relocated several times, the region was sparsely populated and dominated by a few ranching families. The economy of the region rose and fell with the gold rush need for supplies, the civil war demand for pine turpentine, logging, and the water way that allowed for ranching. The economy ebbed and flowed for a hundred years under the constraint of the difficult access to the region. In 1962 a new 4-lane alignment of California State Route 70 wrapped around the western side of the then proposed Lake Oroville and reconnected with the existing highway 70 at Jarbo Gap. The realignment placed a major throughway to the Concow region, opening the area for residential purposes and made it easier for adherents to the then blossoming 'land movement' to find inexpensive land in an undeveloped region, within commuting distance of a large metropolitan region. From this point to 2008, Concow become a haven for those escaping 'the world.' Unpermitted structures constructed with commune labor and primitive or re-purposed materials dotted the landscape and housed an eclectic community for the next 50 years. In 2008 a 60,000 acre (large fire) wildfire destroyed 250 structures, of those 220 were unpermitted and either were not built to building codes, did not bother with building inspections, or did not use approved building materials.Catastrophe in Concow, by Tina Meyer and Sarah Salisbury, Chico News and Review, 8/14/2008 https://www.newsreview.com/chico/catastrophe-in-concow/content?oid=722701 Due to the 'land' nature of the community, affording construction following building codes was not possible initially and reconstruction to building codes is not possible or within the 'ethos' of the community.CSU Chico students help rebuild Concow http://www.csuchico.edu/ecc/documents/newsletter/ecc_connections2009s.pdf The county offered special waivers for reconstruction, but the community was already gutted, those who remain are a shadow of the community.Concow fire victims may get break: Special ag building permits last forever, By ROGER AYLWORTH, 11/202008 http://www.orovillemr.com/general-news/20081120/concow-fire-victims-may-get-break-special-ag-building-permits-last-forever Filling this void is a wave of retiring baby boomers and young couples following a current 'land movement' based on contemporary ideals but still following the core of previous movements. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which,  of it is land and  of it (1.35%) is water. For unknown reasons the community's name was absent from the US Geological Survey files until 1990. Other nearby communities are The Pines (USGS feature ID 268203), and Deadwood (USGS feature ID 1655957). The community is off State Route 70 east of Cherokee. Concow School is shown on some maps. There is a Concow Dam, Road, and Creek nearby. The 2010 United States Census found 710 people living in Concow, for a population density of 25.6 people per square mile (10/km²), one-fifth the global average density and comparable to Bolivia, but still a fair degree of people in comparison to the rest of the Western United States. This is two-thirds the population found ten years earlier in the 2000 census. Concow is by far populated by whites (611, 86%). A fifth (99 people) of the population is non-white, of those there are no African Americans. In the 2000 census there was one African American family. They lost their home during the 2008 fire and then shortly after rebuilding, their head of household died. The double hit forced the family to relocate. Half the non-white population (57, 8% of total population) identifies with two or more races - including these multi-racial people, the census found the following racial breakdown: Within the Latino population, 10 people (1.5%) identified themselves as 'other races'. 'Other' is the third largest racial grouping in the broader United States"Some other race," The Economist, Feb 9th 2013. http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21571487-how-should-america-count-its-hispanics-some-other-race and most often refers to Hispanics. Most likely the Concow combined Latino and Hispanic population is 9%, two-thirds of the average for Butte County, the breakdown given above reflects this. The Census found that the entire population (710 people) lives in households. There are no provisions for housing non-institutionalized 'group home' or institutionalized people. There are 360 housing units at an average density of 13 per square mile (5/km²), of which, the vast majority 251 (83%) are owner-occupied, accounting for 572 people, 80% of the population. A sixth of the housing (51, 17%) is occupied by renters, accounting for the remaining 138 people (20% of the population). The homeowner vacancy rate is 4.5% and the rental vacancy rate is 4%, meaning 96% of the housing is occupied (15 unoccupied housing units), typical for a tight housing market. There were 302 households; the average size is 2.4 people each. There were 178 families (60% of all households); the average family size is 2.9. A fifth of households (62, 20%) and a third of families (60, 30%) have children under the age of 18 living in them. Half the households (146, 48%) and 80% of the families are opposite-sex married couples living together. The 'traditional' married family unit and predominates in Concow. Less than 10% (26, 9%) of the population are unmarried opposite-sex partners. A third of households (85, 28%) are individuals. The remaining 10% of households are single-parent families, there is a small population of single mothers (21, 7%) and a few single fathers (11, 4%). Same-sex married couples or partnerships are rare in Concow, there is one same-sex partnership. For every female age 18 and over, there are 1.19 males, a high ratio that is associated with social unrest due to the inability for males to find a partner. The median age is 50 years. The age distribution is skewed to an older population. Using the United States average age distribution http://www.censusscope.org/us/chart_age.html as a comparison: Concow is rural and home to an older population that is married or has been married and owns their residence. The expected population of school aged youths and child bearing age couples are half of the population expected. The older population is predominantly white, and skewed towards older single men. The missing couples and their children is most likely explained by employment in Concow and this forms a constraint on how many couples the region can support. These couples either are the sum of job opportunities in Concow or they are able to offset the transportation and risk cost of commuting to work through maintaining their own vehicles or offsetting the transportation cost with exceptionally low housing costs. Some couples in the community additionally subsidize their food cost through evening hunting and heating cost through the readily available woodcutting; two opportunities somewhat unique to exceptionally rural areas like Concow. Concow is a census-designated place (CDP) in Butte County, California, United States. In June and July 2008 the Butte Lightning Complex fire destroyed more than 50% of the structures and possibly reduced the population by a similar proportion, with an unknown affect on the CDP age, race, and income demographics [ ][ ][ ]. At the 2000 census the population was 1,095 and with 319 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 29.1 people per square mile (11.2/km²). There were 571 housing units at an average density of 15.2 per square mile (5.9/km²). In 2008 the Butte Lightning Complex fire destroyed 308 homesRoger H.

As individuals, in the Concow CDP there are, 10 Blacks or African Americans, 25 Native Americans, 6 Asians, 12 Pacific Islanders, 12 who identify themselves as other races, 47 who identify with two or more races and 52 inhabitants of the Concow region who identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino. In the CDP the population was spread out with 23% under the age of 18, 4% from 18 to 24 (i.e., 44 individuals), 21% from 25 to 44, 34% from 45 to 64, and 18% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 46 years. For every 100 females there were 117.7 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 109.9 males. 24% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them. 53% were married couples living together, 8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30% were non-families. 23% of all households were made up of individuals and 8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.4 and the average family size was 2.7. The median income for a household in the CDP was $32,000, and the median income for a family was $41,250. Males had a median income of $24,408 versus $39,479 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $15,829.  About 8% of families and 14% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27% of those under age 18 and 7% of those age 65 or over. Historically the Concow region supported hunter-gatherer societies, turpentine extraction, dairy farming, ranching, forestry, water supply, and in the areas outside the granite sands - Quartz reef mining and related industries. The region is zoned (2010 map) for timber production, 5 to 10ac foothill residential, a small area for 1ac foothill residential, and a couple small areas for commercial.http://www.buttegeneralplan.net/products/2010-07-02_Draft_ZO/maps/ParadiseConcowYankeeHillStirlingCity_Esize.pdf Today, there are eight businesses/employers operating in Concow - each of these employ two or three people In the late 1990s the CDP became known regionally for a significant domestic product consisting of informal market production and commerce [ ]. The region contains marijuana agricultural production, large irrigated plantations were discovered during the 2008 fire. The 2000 domestic product from legitimate income sources is approximately $17.5 million, during and after the 2008 fires an estimated $50 million worth of marijuana was removed [ ][ ], indicating that the region's per-capita income is under-reported. The region's marijuana production is 1/3 of 1% of California's $14 billion (2013) dollar total production http://enr.construction.com/policy/legal/2013/1111-in-california-inspection-of-pot-farms-moves-out-of-the-weeds.asp [ ] [ ].
