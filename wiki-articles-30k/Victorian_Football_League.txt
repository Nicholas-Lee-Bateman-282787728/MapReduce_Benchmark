      The Victorian Football League (VFL)  which evolved from the former Victorian Football Association (VFA), taking its new name as from the 1996 season, is the major state-level Australian rules football league in Victoria. For historical purposes, the present VFL is sometimes referred to as the VFA/VFL, to distinguish it from the present day Australian Football League (AFL), which was known until 1990 as the Victorian Football League. The VFA was formed in 1877, immediately after the foundation of a similar body in South Australia and is the second-oldest Australian rules football league, replacing the loose affiliation of clubs that had been the hallmark of the early years of a game which was first played as early as the 1850s. Today, the VFL is one of many regional Australian semi-professional competitions. From 2015 it will comprise 15 teams from throughout Victoria, nine of which have a continuous VFA heritage. Many Victorian-based clubs in the fully professional AFL are affiliated with VFL clubs, and as a result, the league partly serves as a reserves competition for the AFL.  The Victorian Football Association (VFA) was founded in 1877 on 17 May.  The new governing body replaced an earlier system where club delegates met informally to decide on the rules, the selection of the winner of the Challenge Cup, the division of clubs into Senior and Junior status, and other matters of mutual interest.  The VFA continued to list its teams as being of either Senior or Junior status. Foundation senior clubs of the VFA in the Melbourne metropolitan area were Albert-park, Carlton, Hotham, Melbourne and St Kilda; regional senior clubs including Geelong, Barwon, Ballarat, Beechworth, Castlemaine, Rochester and Inglewood also competed.The Footballer, 1877 Foundation junior clubs included , Hawthorn, Northcote, South Melbourne, Standard, Victoria United, Victorian Railways and Williamstown.  During its early years, many clubs dropped in and out and there were erratic promotions between the Senior and Junior sections. Scheduling was chaotic. Based on a system that had evolved before the emergence of the Association, the compilation of fixtures was not done by the VFA but was the responsibility of each club secretary. In a typical season a club would play against other VFA teams, both Senior and Junior, non-VFA Victorian clubs, and even intercolonial teams. At the end of each season, the VFA announced the Premier team. This was usually the club with the most wins, but there were some seasons where the VFA judged the leading team had had too many wins against junior clubs, and awarded the Premiership to the club with the second-highest number of wins. From 1878 the Association recorded the number of behinds, but with only goals counting towards a win, thus the number of draws was much higher than under the modern scoring system.  The number of players on the field was usually twenty but when a Senior and Junior team met, the Junior club was usually allowed to field extra players; there were no reserves and if a player was injured the team was a man short. After 1889, the often-changeable collection of clubs in the VFA became settled at twelve consistent clubs: , , Fitzroy, Footscray, , , , Port Melbourne, , , South Melbourne and Williamstown; they were joined by a thirteenth club, , in 1892. After the 1896 season, eight of the thirteen clubs broke away to form the Victorian Football League (VFL): Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne. All twenty VFA premierships to that stage had been shared by six of those eight clubs. The VFA continued to be an independent body, with only five of its pre-1897 clubs – Footscray, North Melbourne, Port Melbourne, Richmond and Williamstown – but within five years it had expanded to ten clubs, a size it maintained until the 1920s. Although its size was constant, its membership was not, with many new clubs lasting only a few years before leaving, and four clubs switching to the VFL: Richmond in 1908, and North Melbourne, Footscray and  (who joined the VFA in 1914) in 1925. A number of rule changes were adopted during the last years of the 19th Century and the first years of the 20th: A number of clubs competed for short lengths of time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: Between at least 1900 and 1902, there was a short-lived VFA 2nd Division consisting of junior clubs such as Heidelberg. In the late 1920s, the VFA expanded to twelve teams, including six new clubs, and those twelve teams remained unchanged for several decades thereafter. Those clubs were: Port Melbourne; Williamstown; Brunswick (joined 1897); Prahran (1899); Brighton (1908); Northcote (1908); Coburg (1925); Camberwell (1926); Preston (1926, after a temporary period between 1903-1911); Yarraville (1928); Oakleigh (1929); Sandringham (1929). The first regular radio broadcasts of VFA games were made by 3XY, a little after the station commenced operations in 1935. The commentator was Wallace ("Jumbo") Sharland who had earlier been the first to describe VFL matches, that being on 3AR in 1923. (Jumbo Sharland was a former Geelong player and, at one time, a newspaper football reporter.)  In 1954 3AK began broadcasting VFA games, albeit only for a season or two. In 1966 Network Ten began to televise Sunday games.  The 1970s also saw broadcasts on 3UZ, while local Geelong station, 3GL, broadcast all Geelong West matches. In 1982, the then-dominant Melbourne sports radio station, 3AW, broadcast the Grand Final. In 2003 3AK evolved into sports radio station SEN 1116, and provided a coverage of VFL matches, but this was discontinued after they won the rights to broadcast the AFL (Australian Football League), as from the 2007 season. In the 2007 and 2008 seasons, Radio 1611 Double X began broadcasting VFL matches. The station was the first to podcast replays. (Details of current broadcasts are found below – "Radio".)    In 1938, the VFA made a bold rule change by legalising throwing of the football in general play, provided the throw was underarm with both hands below shoulder height. The change helped to speed up the game, and introduced more run-and-carry play in an era which had previously been dominated by a long-kicking style, proving popular with many spectators. Additionally, the VFA ended its permit agreement with the VFL, and began to aggressively recruit star players from the VFL – including Laurie Nash and Ron Todd, who were in the primes of their careers and were both considered amongst the best players in the country. These changes gave the VFA a product which could compete with the VFL for public interest, and it made the late 1930s and 1940s one of the most successful periods in the VFA's history. The VFA competition went into recess from 1942 until 1944 due to World War II, but continued to perform strongly upon returning in 1945. While the throw-pass was in effect, particularly during the early 1940s, there were talks between the VFA and VFL towards an amalgamation of the two bodies. Although the throw-pass had been a great success for the VFA, it was felt that a single controlling body for football in Victoria playing under a uniform set of rules was in the best interests of football as a whole. Negotiations for an amalgamation took place over several years, but broke down several times over a variety of issues, including representation at board level, Australian National Football Council representation, and a promotion and relegation structure between the VFA and VFL. In the end, the two bodies never amalgamated, but the schism ended in 1949 when the bodies agreed to recognize each other's clearances and the VFA was granted a seat on the Australian National Football Council; but, as a condition of joining, it was forced to abandon the throw-pass rule and adopt the national standard rules. While these changes did benefit Victorian football as a whole, it effectively stripped the VFA of the on-field distinctions which allowed it to compete with the VFL for fans; this, coupled with the increased mobility of suburban Melburnians – who, due to the increased affordability of cars and the lifting in 1950 of wartime travel restrictions, were no longer captive audiences for their local VFA teams – resulted in a significant downturn in most VFA clubs during the 1950s. On-field, the competition became dominated by the few clubs with strong community links (such as Port Melbourne, Williamstown, Moorabbin and Oakleigh), and the gap between those clubs and the weaker clubs grew large. During the 1950s and 1960s, as Melbourne expanded geographically, the VFA embarked on a deliberate plan to establish its presence in new areas by expanding the number of teams, most of these coming from the newer, outer suburbs. By 1960, the league had expanded to seventeen teams; when the eighteenth club joined in 1961, the VFA was split into First and Second Divisions, the First Division originally having 10 teams, and Second Division eight.  There was a promotion and relegation system between the two Divisions, with one team promoted and one relegated each season. The league was constant at twenty teams during the 1970s, and expanded again into the outer eastern suburbs in the 1980s. At its peak in 1983, there were 24 teams competing across two divisions in the VFA. In 1960, the VFA first allowed premiership matches to be played on Sundays.  After years of losing ground to the VFL, the VFA's launch of Sunday games was a turning point for the better, as it allowed matches to be played without competing the VFL for spectators. Within a few years, clubs found that Sunday matches were as much as three to four times more lucrative than Saturday games. Eventually, most games were played on a Sunday, while the VFL played its games on Saturdays.  This was similar to the College/Pro football day divide still present in the US.  The Victorian Government supported the VFA's new-found vigour, and rejected requests by the VFL to hold games on Sundays. The decline of the VFA is often said to have commenced in 1982 when the VFL's struggling South Melbourne Swans moved to Sydney, as all Sydney Swans home games were played on Sunday and televised, ending the VFA's monopoly on Sunday football; and Network Ten ended its weekly VFA coverage in the same year. However, this was not the sole cause for decline, which had started a few years before 1982: changing demographics meant that many traditional clubs had slowly found themselves in areas with high migrant populations, which either made it difficult to compete with soccer for local for fans and players, or simply brought a level of cultural apathy towards the sport in general; VFA historian Marc Fiddian also noted a decline in the number of ex-VFL players signing with VFA clubs through the late 1970s, which reduced the Associations drawing power, and an increasing gulf in quality between the best and worst clubs. Player payments increased through the 1980s, and declining financial support and sponsorship began to force clubs to out of the Association, with some leaving voluntarily, some folding, and some expelled for failing to meet the VFA's minimum standards. With fifteen teams remaining at the start of 1989, the VFA reverted to a single division. Network Ten began broadcasting VFA finals and late-season matches again in 1984, before the role was taken on by the ABC in 1987. The ABC expanded its coverage to include match of the round throughout the season starting from 1988, and was the primary broadcaster until 2014. The early 1990s continued to be a difficult period for the VFA; only twelve teams remained after 1991, and most were in a perilous financial situation. At the end of the 1994 season, the VFA was formally disbanded in an administrative capacity. Administration of the competition was turned over to the Victorian State Football League, which managed oversaw football at all levels in Victoria, and also ran the statewide under-18s competition (the TAC Cup) and the AFL reserves competition in Victoria. This ended the VFA's independence from the AFL, but created a unified structure for state-level football in Victoria. The VSFL set about aligning the VFA with the TAC Cup, and cut the number of metropolitan teams to nine in 1995, with Prahran, Oakleigh and Dandenong departing. The remaining clubs had joined in various eras: two (Port Melbourne and Williamstown) had been in the VFA prior to 1897, three (Preston, Coburg and Sandringham) represented the 1920s expansion, and four (Box Hill, Frankston, Springvale and Werribee) were admitted during the last few decades. The VFA name was retained for the on-field competition during its first season under VSFL administration; then, in 1996, the competition was renamed the Victorian Football League (VFL) – the same name which had been used by the rival VFL/AFL competition until 1990. Despite the change in name and administrative structure, the on-field competition is considered continuous, and VFA records are recognised in the VFL era. In 1996, the VFL began a period of expansion into regional areas as part of its alignment with the TAC Cup competition, with existing powerhouse country clubs North Ballarat and Traralgon joining the nine metropolitan teams. Traralgon's tenure was short-lived but they were soon replaced by another regional club, Bendigo.  From 1995 until 1999, the VSFL had operated its two open-age competitions – the VFL and the Victorian AFL reserves competition – separately. Following the 1999 season, under the administration's new name Football Victoria (later AFL Victoria), those two competitions were merged into a single competition still known as the Victorian Football League. Since this time, the VFL has been contested by a mixture of: The affiliation deals greatly improved the financial viability of the clubs in question, but they diluted their ability to represent their suburb. There have been many changes to the affiliation arrangements in the decade since the VFL and VSFL merged. Initially, only four of the ten Victorian AFL clubs were involved in a VFL affiliation, with the rest fielding reserves teams. At its peak of between 2003-2006, nine of the ten Victorian AFL clubs were involved in an affiliation, with only Geelong fielding its own reserves team. Many clubs have since migrated away from this model, and from 2014 there will be five AFL clubs fielding stand-alone reserves teams in the VFL. Also notable, but short-lived feature of the new competition was the playing of feature matches on Monday nights, a time-slot in which no AFL matches were played. However, these matches were not shown on free-to-air television, but on Channel 7's C7 Sport subscription channel. This was at a time when pay TV penetration was very poor; there was no access to this channel in most of Melbourne, and in the parts of Melbourne that could receive it there was a much more popular competing subscription platform, Foxtel. There was also a small continuation of the expansion of the league into regional areas, with the Murray Kangaroos Football Club representing the Ovens & Murray Football League and an expansion into Tasmania, but both of these teams have since folded. These days the VFL is moderately popular in Victoria, although not nearly as well-supported as the dominant Australian Football League. Matches now attract both traditional fans of the VFA/VFL clubs, and fans of affiliated AFL clubs keen to watch their reserves players in action.  The first award for the Association best and fairest player was the Recorder Cup, first awarded in 1923. Starting from 1933, a second award, the V.F.A. Medal, was awarded concurrently; the awards were both based on the votes of the umpires, but were based on different voting systems. In 1940, the Association dispensed with the Recorder Cup voting system, and awarded both trophies to the same player based on the same set of votes. Since 1945, the award for the best and fairest player in each VFA/VFL season has been the J. J. Liston Trophy, named after long-term Association president John James Liston, who died in 1944. The VFL is classed as a semi-professional competition. In 2007 the league had a salary cap of $185,000 excluding service payments. There are a significantly higher number of AFL reserves due to affiliations with Victorian clubs, but player payments for these appearances is apparently not included in the VFL's salary cap. Following the 2013 VFL season, it was revealed that several clubs were lobbying VFL executives to increase the salary cap in a bid to keep high-level players who had relieved themselves of participating in the league in order to accept more attractive financial offers in local football competitions, where such caps are far less regulated.Stand-alone VFL clubs want increase in salary cap (The Age December 2013) Attendances are small by AFL standards, and generally less than the SANFL and WAFL, with an average of between 500–1,000 in attendance. Crowds for many finals matches however tend to average in the 2,000-6,000 range, with the Grand Final typically attracting a crowd in the 10,000-12,000 mark.QF Final 2014, Footscray v WilliamstownPF Final 2014, Footscray v Port MelbournePF Final 2014, Box Hill v Williamstown The VFL does not publish home and away attendance figures as some games are played as AFL curtain raisers, however various sources quote attendances for some games of the stronger clubs that maintain home records of their own. As of the 2015 season, the VFL's exclusive broadcaster is the Seven Network. From 1988 until 2014, ABC Victoria (branded ABC) broadcast the match of the round live from 1pm on Saturday afternoons during the home and away season, as well as broadcasting six finals each year, including the Grand Final. In 2012 and 2013 ABC replayed each match fully to national audience during the early hours of Wednesday.VFL - ABC News This was previously done in 2006 and 2007 during the early hours of Thursday on ABC2.ABC TV Guide The ABC's coverage of VFL football ended after the 2014 season.

The listings (below) for 1877 to 1887 are based on various newspaper reports as researched by Graeme Atkinson and published in his book Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Australian Rules Football ... (1982, The Five Mile Press, Melbourne). Finals series (initially the Argus system, and from 1933 the Page-McIntyre system) were introduced in 1903 and, therefore from that date, the listing (below) reflects that situation after the finals. The VFA conducted a Page-McIntyre Final Four from 1933 to 1988 (including both Division One and Division Two from 1961 to 1988) with the exception of 1960 when a Final Six for the single Division of 17 teams was held. In 1989 the VFA reverted to a single Division with a Final Five.

The VFA and VFL have operated a seconds or reserves competition since the 1920s. From its inception until 1979, the seconds team played on Saturday afternoons, playing at home when the senior team played away and vice versa. Since 1980, seconds matches have been played as curtain-raisers to senior matches, on Saturdays or Sundays as necessary. The competition was later renamed the reserves, and then from the beginning of the 2012 season it has been known as the AFL Victoria Development League, a move that coincided with the introduction of the AFL Victoria Development Academy which provides development opportunities for up to 25 selected VFL players per year.[ ] Since 2014, only nine of the VFL's clubs have fielded a team in the Development League. These are the nine clubs from metropolitan Melbourne with a continuous VFA heritage: Box Hill, Casey, Coburg, Frankston, Northern Blues, Port Melbourne, Sandringham, Werribee and Williamstown.

1989–1992 16 Tony Hannebery Williamstown 1993–1994 From 1897 behinds (1 point) were counted towards the score. (The VFL also changed its scoring system in the same year.) The 'little mark' was abolished in 1897.  A 'little mark' was taken when a player passed the ball by foot at least two yards (1.83 m) generally from a pack of players.  It was difficult for umpires to pick out 'little marks' in scrimmages.  It was abolished to open up play.  (The VFL also abolished it in the same year.) Also in 1897 the number of players was reduced from 20 to 18.  This worked well as it gave players more freedom around the packs.  Since then there have been a few modifications to the VFA's on-field numbers: 1908 – to 17; 1912 – to 16; 1918 – reverted to 18; 1959 – to 16; 1992 – reverted to 18.  (The VFL changed from 20 to 18 two years after the VFA [1899] and has had 18 players on the ground ever since.) An order-off rule was also introduced in 1898 but only lasted for two seasons as it was not popular with either players or umpires.  Umpires were never sure how rough things had to get before they could order a player off, rather than awarding a free kick to an opponent.  (The VFL has never had an order-off rule.) In 1903 the VFA introduced its first finals.  Prior to this, the four teams at the top of the ladder at the end of what are now called home-and-away games made up the 'final four'.  (The VFL had introduced finals in 1897.) Essendon Town 1900-1921,  Name changed to Essendon (Association) in 1905; Geelong 1922-1927.  Officially the Geelong Football Club, the team was known as Geelong (Association) or as Geelong A. Hawthorn 1913-1925; Melbourne City 1912-1913.  The club lost all of the 36 games played; West Melbourne 1879-1880 and 1899-1907.
