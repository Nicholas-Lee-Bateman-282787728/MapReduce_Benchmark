   The Toyota Supra is a sports car/grand tourer that was produced by Toyota Motor Corporation from 1978 to 2002. The styling of the Toyota Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider. Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and began just calling the car Supra. Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. First, second, and third generation Supras were assembled at Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi while the fourth generation Supra was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The Supra also traces much of its roots back to the Toyota 2000GT with the main instance being its engine. The first three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the Toyota Crown's and 2000GT's M engine. All four generations of Supra produced have an inline 6-cylinder engine. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code "A". Along with this name and car Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It is derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval company logo. (the dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what color it was. It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it too was discontinued.) In 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the Supra in the United States and in 2002 Toyota officially stopped production of the Supra in Japan. Generation names are A40, A60, A70, A80. A Popular trend Started by American owners was to name the cars using Volkswagen Mark terms but this was never adopted by Toyota nor has ever been used in any of It's publications the "Official" names refer to the chassis codes only. Toyota uses, the name Mark II to refer to its X chassis platform cars that Include the Mark II, Cressida, Chaser and Cresta models. The Supra has appeared in numerous video games, movies, music videos and TV shows. Some of the most notable appearances include the Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, Need for Speed, Midnight Club,and Forza Horizon 2 video games and The Fast and the Furious film series.   The first generation Supra was based largely upon the Toyota Celica liftback, but was longer by . The doors and rear section were shared with the Celica but the front panels were elongated to accommodate the Inline-6 instead of the stock Celica's 4-cylinder engine. Toyota's original plan for the Supra at this time was to make it a competitor to the very popular Datsun (now Nissan) Z-car. In April 1978 Toyota began production of the Supra in Japan, as the Celica XX, and sold alongside the Celica at Japanese dealership sales channels called Toyota Corolla Store The Supra was offered with a  2.0 L 12-valve SOHC inline-6 engine (M-EU, chassis code MA45) or the   12-valve SOHC inline-6 engine (4M-E, chassis code MA46). The Japanese Supra was equipped with the smaller 2.0 L engine so that buyers would not incur an additional tax under vehicle size and engine displacement regulations. Both engines were equipped with electronic fuel injection. The installation of the 2.0 litre engine did obligate Japanese buyers to pay a higher level of annual road tax making ownership of the car more expensive compared to the smaller Celica. The Supra was first exported outside Japan in January 1979. The export version of the Mark I was originally equipped with a   12-valve SOHC inline-6 engine (4M-E, chassis code MA46). Drive train options for the model were either a 5-speed manual (W50) or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission (A40D). Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive gear whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over . The drive train for the Supra retained the T series solid rear axle configuration of the Celica in the Japanese MA45 version and a larger F series (and optional Limited Slip Differential) in the MA46 and MA47. The car also came standard with 4-wheel disc brakes and featured a four-link rear suspension with coil springs, lateral track bar, and stabilizer bar. The front suspension consisted of MacPherson struts and a stabilizer bar. The interior of the Supra had optional power windows and power locks as part of the convenience package. The convenience package also included cruise control and special door trim with door pull straps, with an optional sunroof. As for standard features, in the center console there was an extendible map light and a flip-top armrest, which provided storage. Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets on the backs of the front seats, and a tonneau cover under the liftback. The dashboard also contained a state of the art AM/FM/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel. The mid 1979 changes for the 1980 model year US version were mostly cosmetic. The interior received a redesigned center console and a digital quartz clock. On the exterior were redesigned side view mirrors and 14x5" aluminum wheels were standard (the previous year had steel wheels with plastic wheel covers standard and the aluminum wheels were optional). In addition, body molded mudflaps became available. On the copper metallic and white cars, the mudflaps were painted the body color while the mudflaps were left black on all other colors. On the rear of the mudflaps, the word "Celica" was painted in white lettering. The official Supra site also notes that there was an addition of optional leather-trimmed seating and automatic climate-control.   In August 1980 (for the 1981 model year), the Supra received an upgrade in displacement with the  5M-E engine. It was still a 12-valve SOHC engine, but made  and  of torque. The car's automatic transmission was changed to the revised Toyota A43D and it gained a revised final drive gearing. Because of the change in engine and transmission they dubbed a new chassis code of MA47. In the final year of the first generation supra, it achieved a 0–60&nbsp;mph time of 10.24 seconds and finished the 1/4 mile in 17.5 seconds at . Also in 1980 (for the 1981 model year), a new Sports Performance Package became an option, which included sport suspension, raised white letter tires, and front and rear spoilers. This also marked the last year that an 8-track tape player was offered in any Supra. The Celica XX (pronounced as "double X") is the Japanese domestic market name of the first generation model Toyota Celica Supra. It was offered in Japan during the years 1978–1981, and was redesigned in 1981. Toyota obtained engineering assistance from Lotus Cars, and supplied some components for use in the Lotus Excel.  The Supra was sold as the Celica XX only in Japan at Japanese dealership sales channels called Toyota Corolla Store, as elsewhere it was sold as the Celica Supra, although they remain popular as grey imports to New Zealand. The 2000GT was the flagship model of the XX range. Featuring the smaller 2.0-litre six-cylinder DOHC 24-valve 1G-EU, Yamaha took the base 1G-EU and improved it, resulting in the 1G-GEU significantly upping the output of the engine, which also served in the 1985 Toyota Soarer. The smaller-capacity engine meant taxes were less than the bigger 5M-GEU of the 2800GT. 1G-GEU made 160 PS (118&nbsp;kW) at 6400 rpm. The 2800GT was the most powerful of the range, featuring the 2.8-litre six-cylinder DOHC 5M-GEU making 175 PS (129&nbsp;kW) at 5,600 rpm. The 2000G/S with M-TEU with intercooler made 160 PS (118&nbsp;kW) at 5400 rpm, as much as the 1G-GEU, but made more torque lower down the rev range, 23.5 m·kgf (230 N·m at 3000 rpm. The lower-range models, being 2000G/S, were the least powerful, featuring the 1G-EU, which made 125 PS (92&nbsp;kW) at 5,400 rpm. They also lacked a lot of features found on other models in an effort to lower cost. In 1981, the Celica XX introduced the world's first navigation computer. In late 1981, Toyota completely redesigned the Celica Supra as well as the entire Celica lineup for its 1982 production year. In Japan, they were known as Celica XX, but everywhere else the Celica Supra name was used. Still being based around the Celica platform, there were several key differences, most notably the design of the front end and fully retractable pop-up headlights. Other differences would be the inline-6 still present in the Supra instead of the inline-4 as well as an increase in length and wheelbase to conform with the overall larger engine. Vehicles installed with the 5M engine were slightly wider, while other models remained compliant with Japanese dimension regulations. In 1981, Japanese buyers were offered an alternative to the Celica XX fastback bodystyle, called the Toyota Soarer coupe, which was offered at a different Japanese Toyota dealership network called the "Toyota Store", as the Celica XX was sold at the "Toyota Corolla Store". In the North American market, the Celica Supra was available in two distinct models. There was the "Performance Type" (P-type) and the "Luxury Type" (L-type). While being mechanically identical, they were differentiated by the available options; tire size, wheel size, and body trim. The P-type had fiberglass fender flares over the wheel wells, while the L-type did not. The P-type was also standard with the more sporty eight-way adjustable seats. The P-type did not get the option of a leather interior until 1983. All editions of the P-type had the same 14x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels and throughout the years the L-type had 14x5.5-inch wheels until 1985 when they were changed to a P-type styled 15x6. The L-type also had the option of a digital dash with trip computer; some Canadian models had this option as well as a few rare instances of American models. The digital dash featured a digital tachometer, digital speedometer, and electronic fuel level and coolant level gauges. The trip computer could calculate and display various things such as fuel economy in miles-per-gallon, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and distance remaining to destination. Excluding the 1982 model, all P-types were available with headlight washers as an option, but the L-types were never given such an option. Although gear ratios changed throughout the years, all P-types came standard with a limited slip differential. For 1982, in the North American market, the Celica Supra's engine was the  12-valve (two valves per cylinder) DOHC 5M-GE. Power output was  and  of torque. The engine utilized an 8.8:1 compression ratio to achieve the power and featured a vacuum advanced distributor. When the car debuted it clocked a 0–60 time of 9.8 seconds and netted a 17.2 second 1/4 mile at   The standard transmission for this year was the W58 5-speed manual with the A43DL 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types. Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear and the automatic featured a locking torque converter. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over . The 1982 model's rear differential featured a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes. On the inside, this generation had standard power windows, power door locks, and power mirrors as well as a tilt steering wheel. The power door lock was located in the center console next to the power mirror control. The analog dash of this year only went to 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) in North America. The optional automatic climate control was renovated and was now seen as a standard feature on the A60. Cruise control was standard in this generation. Toyota also included the retractable map light as standard. Some options included the addition of a sunroof, two-tone paint schemes, and a five-speaker AM/FM/MPX tuner with cassette. The optional cassette stereo featured a 105-watt power amplifier and a seven-band graphic equalizer. The standard stereo was a five-channel AM/FM/MPX tuner. Leather was an option on L-types of this year, but P-types were limited to standard striped cloth. The AM/FM antenna was integrated into the front windshield rather than a typical external mast antenna. There was a key lock on the gas tank door (in lieu of a remote release) and the hatch and rear bumper were black regardless of paint color on the rest of the car. The P-types were available with an optional rear sunshade above the hatch glass. The lights in the rear featured a reverse light in the center and the door handles opened the doors by pulling sideways. The front nose badge and B-pillar only read "Supra" for the first several months of production, but were changed to read "Celica Supra" midway through the model year. L-types had front and rear mudflaps but P-types of this year did not. For the 1983 models not much was altered, but there was an increase in power output to  and  of torque from the same 5M-GE. The only real change in the engine area was the switch from a vacuum advanced to an electronic advanced distributor, yet that did not increase the power. Toyota switched to a 4.10:1 rear gear ratio for the P-type and a 3.73:1 for the L-type. As for the optional automatic transmission, they replaced the A43DL 4-speed with a newly designed A43DE 4-speed. It featured an electronic controller that would adjust its shift pattern for a balance between performance and economy. It was the first in the industry to provide an electronically controlled transmission (ECT). This allowed the driver to choose either the "power" driving mode or "normal" driving mode at the touch of the button. The power mode provided the quickest acceleration and the normal mode provided the best all-around performance. On the inside of the car there were virtually no changes, but changes to the exterior included a switch to a power mast antenna, mudflaps on all models, and the addition of headlight washers on P-types. All B-pillar and nose badges for cars sold in North America read "Celica Supra" and only P-types were available in two-tone color schemes. In 1984, Toyota changed quite a bit on the Supra. Power output was increased on the 5-speed models with a bump up to  and  of torque. The increase was achieved by a mixture of a redesigned intake manifold with "D"-shaped intake runners and an increase in compression ratio to: 9.2:1. Another notable change in the 5-speeds was the switch to a 4.30:1 gear ratio in the rear differential. All automatic Supras retained the previous years power numbers, but the rear gear ratio was changed to a 4.10:1. The most notable exterior change was the switch to wraparound front turn signals. Also on the outside the tail-lights were redesigned and the hatch received a billboard "Supra" sticker instead of the smaller sticker, which was previously positioned on the right. The rear hatch and bumper was changed and received the same color as the rest of the car (instead of the black of previous years). The door handles were also switched around, opening by pulling up instead of sideways. This year Toyota also decided to offer two-tone paint schemes on both the P-type and L-type. Some interior controls such as the steering wheel, cruise control, and door lock switch were redesigned. Toyota included a  speedometer instead of the traditional 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) one and the automatic climate control display was also changed. The previous year's cassette and equalizer stereo option was now made a standard feature. The Supra was altered again in 1985. On the engine side, power output was increased to  and  of torque. All Supras this year had the same amount of power (both automatics and 5-speeds). The engine received a redesigned throttle position sensor (TPS) as well as a new EGR system and knock sensor. With the slight increase in power the Supra was able to propel itself from 0–60&nbsp;mph in 8.4 seconds and netted a 16.1 second quarter mile at . Other changes would be a redesigned, more integrated sunshade and spoiler on the rear hatch. The rear spoiler was changed from a one-piece to a two-piece. The L-types of this year were not available with a leather interior, but P-types were. Toyota added a standard factory theft deterrent system and the outside mirrors were equipped with a defogger that activated with the rear defroster. All Supras this year received automatic-off lights that also encompassed an automatic illuminated entry and fade-out system. While 1985 was to be the last year of the second generation model, delays in production of the third generation model led to a surplus of second generation Supras. During the first half of 1986 the 1985 P-type was still offered for sale, with only minor cosmetic changes as well as the addition of a now mandatory rear-mounted third brake light on the hatch. These were all labelled officially as 1986 models. P-types were the only model available in 1986. The second generation Supra came in a variety of options around the world as well as only being offered during select years. In May 1986, Toyota was ready to release its next version of the Supra. The bonds between the Celica and the Supra were cut; they were now two completely different models. The Celica changed to front-wheel drive, utilizing the Toyota "T" platform associated with the Toyota Corona, while the Supra kept its rear-wheel-drive platform. The engine was updated to a more powerful 3.0  inline 6. Although only available in naturally aspirated trim in 1986.5, a turbocharged version of the engine was introduced in the 1987 model year. The Supra was now related mechanically to the Toyota Soarer for the Japanese market. All Japanese market Supras with the various versions of the 2.0 L engine were installed in a vehicle that was slightly narrower on the outside so as to be in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations so that Japanese buyers weren't liable for yearly taxes for driving a larger car. The new A70 Supra engine, the Toyota 7M-GE, was the flagship engine of Toyota's arsenal. Both versions of the engine contained 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead cams. The turbocharged 7M-GTE engine was Toyota's first distributor-less engine offered in the US which used coil packs sitting on the cam covers and a cam position sensor driven by the exhaust camshaft. It was equipped with a CT26 turbocharger and was rated at  at 5600 rpm while the naturally aspirated 7M-GE engine was rated at  at 6000 rpm. Further refinement on the turbo model increased power to  and  in 1989. This was mostly due to a redesign of the wastegate. All models used the same tire size of 225/50R16 on 16x7 inch wheels. Spare tires were full-sized but on steel wheels. Owing to a large error in the factory head bolt torque specifications (likely owing to switching away from using an asbestos head gasket in lieu of a copper one), all of these engines had severe problems with blown head gaskets. Toyota never issued a recall for any of the affected vehicles. The problem could be easily fixed by replacing the head gasket and torquing the head bolts to  of torque. However, owing to the lack of a recall or appropriate service bulletin, the head gasket problem would recur in another 75,000 miles or so if the gasket was replaced and the bolts were retorqued to the erroneous service manual specifications of . With the head bolts torqued correctly, the engines were otherwise extremely durable. The naturally aspirated came as standard issue with the W58 manual transmission. The turbo versions included the more robust R154 manual transmission. Both were available with the optional 4-speed A340E automatic transmission.  The third-generation Supra represented a great deal of new technology. In 1986, options available for the Supra included 3-channel ABS and TEMS which gave the driver 2 settings which affected the damper rates; a third was automatically activated at WOT, hard braking, and high speed maneuvering. HKS also made a "TEMS Controller" to hack the system and activate it on the fly, though the controllers are now nearly impossible to find. ACIS (Acoustic Control Induction System), a method of controlling air compression pulses inside the intake piping to increase power, was also a part of the 7M-GE's technological arsenal. All models were fitted with double wishbone suspension front and rear. A targa top was offered along with a metal power sliding sunroof (added in '91). Total Supra A70's produced (GA70/MA70/JZA70): Estimated 241,471 The third generation Supra was introduced in May 1986 as a free standing model, officially separating it from the Celica. Whereas the Celica became a front-wheel-drive sport coupe, the Supra retained its image as a rear-wheel-drive sports/GT car. The new Supra would continue to move upscale and become a showcase for Toyota technology. Originally meant to be released in 1985, production delays caused the model to actually be introduced mid year. The all new Supra was powered by a 3.0-liter DOHC inline six-cylinder engine rated at 200&nbsp;bhp. Notable features included an electronically controlled independent suspension (called the Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension – TEMS), and some came with a removable Sport-Roof panel (Targa top). Estimated North American Export Production: 33,283 The first Supra Turbo was introduced in 1987. The inter-cooled, turbo charged version of the 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine boosted power to 230&nbsp;hp (172&nbsp;kW; 233 PS) 240&nbsp;lb·ft (325 N·m). The Turbo model also included an engine oil cooler and integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a limited slip differential (LSD), TEMS, and headlamp washers. A new Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) was optional on both models. Also in 87 a new beige/tan color combination was implemented, and only 1000 models were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin turbo 1G-GT called T-VIS and also included it into the 7M-GT engine as well. Estimated North American Export Production: 29,907 Not much changed for the 1988 year, with the exception of the dropping of two-toned brown exterior paint. The turbo spoiler brake light changed from a square, to a trapezoid shape. Seat pattern was changed from squares to lines, and "foil" on climate control and switch gear changed from light to dark gray. Japanese buyers could select from six different trim packages starting with the top level 3.0 GT Turbo Limited with the 7M-GTEU, followed by 3.0 GT Turbo, GT Twin Turbo with the 1G-GTEU DOHC 2.0 L engine, the GT with the 1G-GEU 2.0 L DOHC, the G with the 1G-EU and the S with the 1G-EU engine as the base model. All Japanese Supras came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or the 4-speed automatic transmission with ECT-s except the G and the S where ECT-S wasn't available. In Japan the 3.0 GT Turbo Limited, the 3.0 GT Turbo and the GT Twin Turbo were installed standard with a digital instrument panel, the 3.0 L installed versions came with an AM/FM Cassette stereo with an integrated CD player and cruise control. Climate control was also standard on all turbo equipped vehicles, and leather interior was only available on the GT Turbo Limited. Estimated North American Export Production: 19,596 During the year of 1989, modifications to the wastegate actuator, feed location and engine management netted another  on the turbo model. The engine mount and brace were also changed in late 1989, with the exact date not known as of this writing. The changes made to the cross member and mounts made to accommodate the 1JZ engine for Japan models. The protective body molding was also changed by taking away the steel reinforcement. This made the molding lighter and prevented the rusting problem on the previous years. The "white package" was introduced as well, featuring white body molding and white wheels. Interior choices were limited to blue and burgundy only. Other than pure cosmetics, there was nothing different from other models. All models received rear 3 point seat belts to replace the previous years' two point lap belts. New tail lights, front bumper with integrated lower grille (as opposed to the previous years' detachable grille), side mirrors, turn signals, upper grilles, foglights, steering wheel, door panels, climate control, window switches and bezels, and stereo. Addition of coat hooks on B-pillar and removal of rear seat pockets round out interior changes. Turbo models received three piece spoiler with integrated LED brake light. 1989 also marked the end of headlight washers in the US and SuperMonitor; an advanced system offered by Toyota able to calculate miles able to be traveled on current tank, ability to check vehicle codes from inside the cabin, among other features. Estimated North American Export Production: 14,544 For the 1990 model year, changes included larger protective laminate in front of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 & 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side. In addition to an airbag and airbag indicator light on dash, there was also a redesign of the left side switch panel, which replaced one of the coin slots with the dimmer. Lower dash panel became a two piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one piece panel owing to a change in material. Finally the memory lever on the steering column was removed. Estimated North American Export Production: 6,419  For the 1991 model year, the wheel design was changed to 5-spoke wheels. Both models wore 16x7 aluminum alloy wheels that were fitted with 225/50/16 tires and full-sized spares on steel wheels. Body molding changed in color to better match the exterior. The front "Supra" emblem was also changed to the current corporate oval Toyota symbol. The speedometer was also revised, and included more lines in the speedometer, that were removed in 1989, but still did not have as many (one line per mph) as 86.5 to 1988 models. New interior colors shadow gray and deep red were introduced, which marked the end of medium gray, tan and burgundy. Blue became only available on white packages, and those with blue paint. Burgundy was replaced with white package-only deep red. Every other body color received shadow gray, with leather interiors retaining medium gray seats and interior inserts. Front speakers were changed from 3.5" to 6.5" and the speaker cover was also enlarged to accommodate them. Estimated North American Export Production: 3,623 For 1992 leather shadow gray interiors received black seats and inserts. Non-turbo models lost the option of a targa top, and a new optional subwoofer was available. Subwoofer-equipped Supras did without the rear bins, and wooden "floorboard." Instead rear carpet was molded to the spare tire, and there was a cut-out for the woofer housing. Estimated North American Export Production: 1,193 The Supra was also available in two non-export models in Japan, the JZA70 with a 2.5 L  twin-turbo 1JZ-GTE, known as 2.5GT Twin Turbo (JZA70), and the GA70 with a 2.0 L  twin-turbo 1G-GTE and non turbo 1G-GEU. A special version of the 1JZ-GTE equipped JZA70, the 2.5 Twin Turbo R, had a Torsen differential, Bilstein suspension, larger diameter sway bars, Recaro seats, Momo wheel and gear knob and matching interior trim. The front lip included front brake ducts. The Twin Turbo R introduced the color option Metallic Dark Green. This model was the fastest production A70. The Turbo-A was Toyota's evolution model for [Group A] Japanese Touring Car Championships (JTCC) all over the world which required a minimum homologation run of 500 units which were only sold in Japan and was produced between August and September 1988. Thus the term 88 Spec A. Some noted differences between the standard Supra 3.0 GT and the Turbo-A model are both cosmetic and mechanical. The engine came with a special head that had less valve shrouding, and clearance cut for higher lift cams. TRD sourced cams helped increase valve lift and the stock CT-26 turbo had a slightly larger inducer. The intercooler had extra rows of cooling tubes and the intercooler piping was larger in diameter. The turbo-A had a 65mm throttle body, instead of the standard 7M-GTE 60&mm size. The fuel management used a MAP system, instead of the standard Karmen Vortex AFM and is a popular and easy swap-out for stand-alone management systems. The front bumper and the 3-piece spoiler and taillights were used on all Japanese market and US market cars. European market vehicles starting in 1989 instead of the typical 86–88 set, were sold in a stealthy plain white, without decals or the 3-piece tailgate spoiler. The front nose however features an additional "Turbo A duct" to add airflow to the heat exchangers. Also unique was the side decal and rear badging ("3.0GT Turbo A") and a black paint job (paint code 202) on Japanese and US market cars. All Japanese Turbo-As came standard with grey leather interior featuring a Momo-sourced steering wheel and shift knob. European models have velour, once again rendering them incognito among the lesser 3.0GT models. Its engine bay features a  7M-GTEU. The car did not win as many races as hoped as it was bumped up a class due to engine size. Being a 3.0L, it was forced to run with more weight whereas the equally powerful, higher revving but slightly smaller capacity R32 Skyline GTR did not have the same weight restriction. It was soon outperformed by the Skyline GT-R R32 when it made its debut in 1990. For the Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC), Toyota would in 1991 switch to racing the Corolla Levins instead in the lower category until the series final year in 1993. However, in the less 'limited' racing, like Group B Rally Championships, National Drag racing, Hill climbs, Sprint Events and Clubmans series, the Supra Turbo-A did considerably better. All Turbo-A cars were fitted with a TRD-sourced torque-vectoring mechanical limited-slip differential with 50:50 left:right lockup on full throttle. TRD was also responsible for the thick rear-anti squat tram-rods which was integral to the multi-link rear suspension setup to control rear squat under hard acceleration and launching. With this version Toyota took a big leap in the direction of a more serious high-performance car. Again using subframe, suspension,and drivetrain assemblies from the Z30 Soarer (Lexus SC300/400), test model pre-production started in December 1992 with 20 models, and official mass production began in April 1993. The new Supra was completely redesigned, with rounded body styling and featured two new engines: a naturally aspirated Toyota 2JZ-GE producing  at 5800 rpm and  at 4800 rpm of torque and a twin turbocharged Toyota 2JZ-GTE making  and  of torque for the Japanese version. The styling, while modern, does seem to borrow some elements from Toyota's first grand touring sports car, the Toyota 2000GT. For the export model (America/Europe) Toyota upgraded the Supra turbo's engine (smaller, steel wheeled turbochargers, bigger fuel injectors, etc.). This increased the power output to  at 5600 rpm and  at 4000 rpm.  (326&nbsp;hp / 325lbft for Europe) The turbocharged variant could achieve 0–60&nbsp;mph in as low as 4.6 seconds and 1/4 mile (402 m) in 13.1 seconds at . The turbo version was tested to reach over , but the cars are restricted to just  in Japan and  elsewhere. European versions of the car also had an air intake or scoop on the hood. Drag coefficient is 0.31 for the naturally aspirated models and 0.32 for the turbo models but unknown with the rear spoiler. The twin turbos operated in sequential mode, not parallel. Initially, all of the exhaust is routed to the first turbine for reduced lag. This resulted in boost and enhanced torque as early as 1800 rpm, where it already produced  of torque. At 3500 rpm, some of the exhaust is routed to the second turbine for a "pre-boost" mode, although none of the compressor output is used by the engine at this point. At 4000 rpm, the second turbo's output is used to augment the first turbo's output. Compared to the parallel mode, sequential mode turbos provide quicker low RPM response and increased high RPM boost. This high RPM boost was also aided with technology originally present in the 7M-GE in the form of the Acoustic Control Induction System (ACIS) which is a way of managing the air compression pulses within the intake piping as to increase power. For this generation, the Supra received a new 6-speed Getrag/Toyota V160 gearbox on the turbo models while the naturally aspirated models made do with a 5-speed manual W58, revised from the previous version. Each model was offered with a 4-speed automatic with manual shifting mode. All vehicles were equipped with 5-spoke aluminium alloy wheels, the naturally aspirated model had 16" rims and the turbo models were 17". The difference in wheel size was to accommodate the larger brakes equipped as standard onto the turbo model, but in Japan were optional extras. Both models had a space saver spare tire on a steel rim to save both space and weight.  Toyota took measures to reduce the weight of this new model. Aluminium was used for the hood, targa top (when fitted), front crossmember, oil and transmission pans, and the suspension upper A-arms. Other measures included hollow carpet fibers, magnesium-alloy steering wheel, plastic gas tank and lid, gas injected rear spoiler, and a single pipe exhaust. Despite having more features such as dual airbags, traction control, larger brakes, wheels, tires, and an additional turbo, the car was at least  lighter than its predecessor. The base model with a manual transmission had a curb weight of . The Sport Roof added  while the automatic transmission added . It had a 51:49 (front:rear) weight distribution. The turbo model weighed  for the manual, automatic added another . Weight distribution was 53% front/47% rear. The Supra was heavier than the spartan Mazda RX-7 and all aluminium bodied Acura/Honda NSX, but it was lighter than the Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4. For the 1996 model year in the US, the turbo model was only available with the automatic transmission owing to OBD-II certification requirements. The targa roof was also made standard on all turbo models. For 1997, manual transmission returned for the optional engine along with a redesign of the tail lights, headlights, front fascia, chromed wheels, and other minor changes such as the radio and steering wheel designs. All 1997 models included badges indicating "Limited Edition 15th Anniversary". All turbo models came standard with the rear spoiler. For 1998, updates were a 3-spoke steering wheel and redesigned radio. In Japan, the turbo engines were installed with VVT-i. The SZ-R model was also updated with the introduction of a six-speed Getrag V161 transmission, the same used for the twin-turbo RZ models. The stock A80 Supra chassis has also proven an effective platform for roadracing, with several top 20 and top 10 One Lap Of America finishes in the SSGT1 class. Despite its curb weight, in 1994 the A80 managed remarkable skidpad ratings of 0.95 lateral g's (200&nbsp;ft) and 0.98 lateral g's (300&nbsp;ft) Supra also featured a four-sensor four-channel track tuned ABS system with yaw control whereby each caliper is sensored and the brakes are controlled individually according to the speed, angle, and pitch of the approaching corner. This unique Formula One-inspired braking system allowed the Supra Turbo to record a  -0 braking distance of , the best braking performance of any production car tested in 1997 by Car and Driver magazine. This record was finally broken in 2004 by a Porsche Carrera GT, which does it in  . The US and UK market Supra featured bigger injectors, steel turbines and bigger inlet cam and had emissions in the range of 259 g/km  despite the addition of Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). The Japanese market Supra had  emissions in the range of 224 g/km. By the late 90s, sales of all sporty coupes were declining in North America, so the Supra was withdrawn from the Canadian market in 1996 and the US in 1998. The Turbo was not available in 1998 in California Air Resources Board (CARB) states. Production continued in Japan until August 2002, ceasing owing to restrictive emission standards.   Motor Trend has reported a possible Supra successor could be based on the Toyota FT-HS (Future Toyota-Hybrid Sport), which debuted at the 2007 North American International Auto Show. A Supra successor could be powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 hybrid system generating over 400&nbsp;hp. Toyota says it is not rushing the Supra successor but instead is waiting to see how the sales and interests of its GT86/FR-S goes. In 2010, Toyota applied for a trademark to the Supra name. The trademark must be used within three years for it to be valid. In December 2011, Autoguide reported a possible Supra replacement that would sit above the Toyota 86. Tetsuya Tada, the chief engineer of the Toyota 86/Scion FR-S told reporters in Germany "the president (Akio Toyoda) has asked me to make a successor to the Supra as soon as possible." In late 2013, AutoBlog reported a Supra successor concept was coming to the January 2014 North American International Auto Show. On January 13, Toyota unveiled its new FT-1 concept car. Little is known about this new concept car; other than that it has a front engine and rear wheel drive layout. Toyota did also state their new concept car draws inspiration from Toyota's past sports cars like the 2000GT, Supra, MR-2, and 2007 FT-HS concept car. Toyota did not state whether the FT-1 would use the Supra name, or if it was even bound for production. However, Toyota did say if the FT-1 is approved from production to expect a price tag of around . On February 10, 2014, Toyota submitted an application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to renew the Supra trademark.
