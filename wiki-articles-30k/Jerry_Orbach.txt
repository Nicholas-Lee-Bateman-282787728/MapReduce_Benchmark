   Jerome Bernard "Jerry" Orbach (October 20, 1935 – December 28, 2004) was an American actor and singer, described at his death as "one of the last bona fide leading men of the Broadway musical and global celebrity on television"Brantley, Ben; Severo, Richard. "Jerry Orbach, Stage and TV Actor, Is Dead at 69", The New York Times, December 30, 2004. Retrieved July 12, 2014 and a "versatile stage and film actor". Orbach's professional career began on the New York stage, both on and off-Broadway, where he created roles such as El Gallo in the original off-Broadway run of The Fantasticks (1960) and became the first performer to sing that show's standard "Try To Remember"; Billy Flynn in the original Chicago (1975-1977), and Julian Marsh in the original 42nd Street (1980-1985). Nominated for multiple Tony Awards, Orbach won for his performance as Chuck Baxter in Promises, Promises (1968-1972). Later in his career, Orbach played supporting roles in various films; such as Prince of the City (1981), Dirty Dancing (1987), Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) and Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1991). He also made frequent guest appearances on television; including a recurring role on Murder, She Wrote (1985-1991). However, he gained worldwide fame for his starring role as NYPD Detective Lennie Briscoe on the long-running NBC crime drama Law & Order (1992-2004).[ ] The Associated Press, 12/29/2004 Orbach was born on October 20, 1935, in the Bronx, the only child of Emily (née Olexy), a greeting card manufacturer and radio singer, and Leon Orbach, a restaurant manager and vaudeville performer.Jerry Orbach profile, filmreference.com; accessed January 16, 2014. His father was a Sephardic Jewish immigrant from Hamburg, Germany.Orbach had stated that his father was descended from Sephardic refugees from the Spanish Inquisition His mother, a native of Pennsylvania, was a Roman Catholic of Polish-Lithuanian descent, and Orbach was raised in her faith (a religious background later replicated in his character on Law & Order). Reprinted in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel on April 7, 1993 as "Orbach Gives `Law & Order` Seedy Side" and Bangor Daily News on March 6, 1993 as "Orbach likes new role as cynical cop."[ ] Throughout his childhood, the Orbach family moved frequently, living in Mount Vernon, New York; Wilkes-Barre, Nanticoke, and Scranton, Pennsylvania; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Waukegan, Illinois. Orbach attended Waukegan High School in Illinois and graduated in 1952 (having skipped two grades in elementary school due to his high IQ). He played on the football team and began learning acting in a speech class. The summer after graduating from high school, Orbach worked at the theatre of  Chevy Chase Country Club  of Wheeling, Illinois, and enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the fall. In 1953, Orbach returned to the Chicago area  and enrolled at Northwestern University. Orbach left Northwestern before his senior year and moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue acting and to study at the Actors Studio, where one of his instructors was the studio's founder, Lee Strasberg.  Orbach was an accomplished Broadway and off-Broadway actor. His first major role was El Gallo in the original 1960 cast of the decades-running hit The Fantasticks, and Orbach became the first to perform the show's signature song and pop standard "Try To Remember". He also starred in The Threepenny Opera, Carnival!, the musical version of the movie Lili (his Broadway debut), in a revival of Guys and Dolls (as Sky Masterson, receiving a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical), Promises, Promises (as Chuck Baxter, winning a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical), the original productions of Chicago (as Billy Flynn, receiving another Tony Award nomination), 42nd Street, and a revival of The Cradle Will Rock. Orbach made occasional film and TV appearances into the 1970s and appeared as a celebrity panelist on both What's My Line? and Super Password. In the 1980s, Orbach shifted to film and TV work full-time. Prominent roles included a superb performance as tough, effective, but "allegedly corrupt" NYPD narcotics detective Gus Levy in Sidney Lumet's Prince of the City; he was the 1981 runner-up for the NSFC Best Supporting Actor award. He also portrayed gangsters in both the action-thriller F/X and the Woody Allen drama Crimes and Misdemeanors (the latter of which also featured his future Law & Order co-star Sam Waterston). In 1985, Orbach became a regular guest star on Murder, She Wrote as private detective Harry McGraw, which led to him starring in the short-lived spin-off series The Law and Harry McGraw. In 1987, he was featured in the hit film Dirty Dancing as Dr. Jake Houseman, the father of Jennifer Grey's character "Baby". He also made further TV appearances on popular shows such as The Golden Girls (for which he received his first Emmy nomination), Who's the Boss?, and Frasier.  In 1991, Orbach starred in Disney's Academy Award-winning animated musical Beauty and the Beast, as the voice (both singing and speaking) of the French-accented candelabrum Lumière, which according to Orbach was played "halfway between Maurice Chevalier and Pepé Le Pew". At the 64th Academy Awards, Orbach performed a live-action stage rendition of the Oscar-nominated song, "Be Our Guest", that he sang in Beauty and the Beast. He later reprised his voice role of Lumière for the film's direct-to-video sequels, multiple episodes of ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', and the previously-deleted song ("[[Human Again (Beauty and the Beast)|Human Again]]") that was added to the ''Beauty and the Beast'' 2002 [[IMAX]] re-release.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=zOzpwaDTR2wC&pg=PA501&dq=Human+Again+%28Beauty+and+the+Beast%29+-%22lyrics%22#v=onepage&q=Human%20Again%20%28Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast%29%20-%22lyrics%22&f=false | title = Walt's People: Talking Disney with the Artists Who Knew Him | isbn = 9781450087476 | author1 = Ghez | first1 = Didier | date = 2010-05-01}}</ref><ref name="digitalmediafx">http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Beauty/beauty-beast-review.html</ref> In 1992, Orbach joined the main ensemble cast of ''[[Law & Order]]'' as the world-weary, wisecracking, streetwise NYPD homicide detective [[Lennie Briscoe]].

You saw the weariness of 25 years of crime-fighting in New York written on his face."<ref>Chosick, Amy and Gamerman, Ellen.[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703691804575254843296805922.html?mod=WSJ_business_LeftSecondHighlights "'Law & Order' School of Drama"]''The Wall Street Journal'', May 21, 2010</ref>  Author [[Kurt Vonnegut]] was a fan of Orbach, and during an Australian radio interview in 2005, he said, "People have asked me, you know, 'Who would you rather be, than yourself?'," and he replied "Jerry Orbach, without a question... I talked to him one time, and he's adorable."<ref>October 6, 2005. Kurt Vonnegut interviewed on ABC Radio National Audio by Phillip Adams. Available on the ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' Region 4 DVD, released by [[Umbrella Entertainment]] Pty Ltd in 2007</ref>  ''New York Times'' writers Ben Brantley and Richard Servero analyzed the breadth and scope of Orbach's career:  <blockquote>Whether singing "Try to Remember" as the dashing narrator of "The Fantasticks" in 1960 or trading barbs with fellow detectives and reluctant witnesses on television in recent years, Mr. Orbach exuded a wry, ragged masculinity that was all his own. As a star of musicals, he created a new kind of hero who was leagues away from suave, swaggering Adonises like [[John Raitt]], [[Howard Keel]], and [[Alfred Drake]]... And he flourished at a time when the Broadway musical hero was fast becoming an endangered species... His rough-edged individuality may account for his endurance on the Broadway stage in an era when other promising musical actors - including [[Larry Kert]], [[Robert Goulet]], and [[Robert Morse]] - proved unable to follow through on their breakthrough successes. Mr. Orbach may have been the last of a breed: no male star since has matched the breadth and continuity of his career in musicals... It wasn't until the 1990s, when he started appearing as Lennie Briscoe in "Law & Order," that Mr. Orbach became a familiar name throughout the country. The rough edge that distinguished him on Broadway eased his transition to character roles like Briscoe, the recovered alcoholic who seemed to greet the discovery of each episode's crime with a world-weary shrug.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brantley |first=Ben |last2=Servero |first2=Richard |date=December 29, 2004 |title= Jerry Orbach, Star of 'Law & Order,' Dies at 69|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/29/arts/29cnd-orba.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>  ''Dirty Dancing'' co-star [[Patrick Swayze]] memorialized Orbach after his death:  <blockquote>Jerry Orbach has been one of the most successful actors who ever lived to make that transition from musical theatre into real, organic, break-your-heart kinds of reality in his work as a film actor, but transition back and forth seamlessly... it was a very interesting time for me, when I was shooting ''Dirty Dancing'', I think probably the eyes I trusted if I was real, and it worked, and I had nailed it, [were] Jerry Orbach's eyes. I would go over to him and under my breath "What did you think?" and he goes "No, go there further, I think there's more you can get." He would say little things like "courage", and it gives me goosebumps to say that. I really, really respected that man. I watched his career from the time I was little. I think it was a great loss when he passed.<ref>{{cite video|work=[[American Film Institute]]|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQlzKrqe6g|title=Patrick Swayze Talks About Working With Jerry Orbach}}</ref></blockquote>  ==Filmography==  ===Stage=== {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !
