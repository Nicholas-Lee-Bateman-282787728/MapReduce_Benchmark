 The Rolls-Royce Merlin is a British liquid-cooled V-12 piston aero engine of 27-litres (1,650&nbsp;cu in) capacity. Rolls-Royce designed the engine and first ran it in 1933 as a private venture. Initially known as the PV-12, it was later called Merlin following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after birds of prey. After several modifications, the first production variants of the PV-12 were completed in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. More Merlins were made for the four-engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber than for any other aircraft; however, the engine is most closely associated with the Spitfire, starting with the Spitfire's maiden flight in 1936. A series of rapidly applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability. One of the most successful aircraft engines of the World War II era, some fifty marks of Merlin were built by Rolls-Royce in Derby, Crewe and Glasgow, as well as by Ford of Britain at their Trafford Park factory, near Manchester.Pugh 2000, pp. 192–198.Harvey-Bailey 1995, pp. 12, 16. The Packard V-1650 was a version of the Merlin built in the United States, and was the primary engine used in the North American P-51 Mustang. Production ceased in 1950 after 160,000 engines had been delivered, the later variants being used for airliners and military transport aircraft.Harvey-Bailey 1995, p. 90. In military use the Merlin was superseded by its larger-capacity stablemate, the Rolls-Royce Griffon. Merlin engines remain in Royal Air Force service today with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and power many restored aircraft in private ownership worldwide. In the early 1930s, Rolls-Royce started planning its future aero-engine development programme and realised there was a need for an engine larger than their 21-litre (1,296&nbsp;cu in) Kestrel which was being used with great success in a number of 1930s aircraft.Rubbra 1990, p. 64. Consequently, work was started on a new -class design known as the PV-12, with PV standing for Private Venture, 12-cylinder, as the company received no government funding for work on the project. The PV-12 was first run on 15 October 1933 and first flew in a Hawker Hart biplane (serial number K3036) on 21 February 1935.Lumsden 2003, p. 203. The engine was originally designed to use the evaporative cooling system then in vogue. This proved unreliable and when supplies of ethylene glycol from the U.S. became available, the engine was adapted to use a conventional liquid-cooling system. The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls-Royce where, as a Merlin testbed, it completed over 100 hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines.Mason 1991, p. 168. In 1935, the Air Ministry issued a specification, F10/35, for new fighter aircraft with a minimum airspeed of . Fortunately, two designs had been developed: the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane; the latter designed in response to another specification, F36/34.McKinstry 2007, p. 53. Both were designed around the PV-12 instead of the Kestrel, and were the only contemporary British fighters to have been so developed. Production contracts for both aircraft were placed in 1936, and development of the PV-12 was given top priority as well as government funding. Following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after birds of prey, Rolls-Royce named the engine the Merlin after a small, Northern Hemisphere falcon (Falco columbarius).Gunston 1989, p. 137. Two more Rolls-Royce engines developed just prior to the war were added to the company's range. The   Rolls-Royce Peregrine was an updated, supercharged development of their V-12 Kestrel design, while the  42-litre (2,560 cu in) Rolls-Royce Vulture used four Kestrel-sized cylinder blocks fitted to a single crankcase and driving a common crankshaft, forming an X-24 layout.Rubbra 1990, p. 139. This was to be used in larger aircraft such as the Avro Manchester.Lumsden 2003, pp.198–200. Although the Peregrine appeared to be a satisfactory design, it was never allowed to mature since Rolls-Royce's priority was refining the Merlin. As a result, the Peregrine saw use in only two aircraft: the Westland Whirlwind fighter and one of the Gloster F.9/37 prototypes. The Vulture was fitted to the Avro Manchester bomber, but proved unreliable in service and the planned fighter using it – the Hawker Tornado – was cancelled as a result.Lumsden 2003, p. 200. With the Merlin itself soon pushing into the  range, the Peregrine and Vulture were both cancelled in 1943, and by mid-1943 the Merlin was supplemented in service by the larger Griffon.Rubbra 1990, p. 118. The Griffon incorporated several design improvements and ultimately superseded the Merlin. Initially the new engine was plagued with problems, such as failure of the accessory gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set.Rubbra 1990, pp. 64–117. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.Rubbra 1990, pp. 82–92. The prototype and developmental engine types were the: The initial design using an evaporative cooling system. Two built, passed bench type testing in July 1934, generating 740 horsepower (552&nbsp;kW) at  equivalent. First flown 21 February 1935. Two built, ethylene glycol liquid cooling system introduced. "Ramp" cylinder heads (inlet valves were at a 45-degree angle to the cylinder). Passed Type Testing February 1935, generating 950 horsepower (708&nbsp;kW) at  equivalent. Development of Merlin B; Crankcase and cylinder blocks became three separate castings with bolt-on cylinder heads. First flight in Hawker Horsley 21 December 1935, 950 horsepower (708&nbsp;kW) at .Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 607. Similar to C with minor design changes. Passed 50-hour civil test in December 1935 generating a constant 955 horsepower (712&nbsp;kW) and a maximum rating of 1,045 horsepower (779&nbsp;kW). Failed military 100-hour test in March 1936. Powered the Supermarine Spitfire prototype.Lumsden 2003, p. 204. Similar to C and E. First flight in Horsley 16 July 1936.Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 610. This became the first production engine; and was designated as the Merlin I. The Merlin continued with the "ramp" head, but this was not a success and only 172 were made. The Fairey Battle was the first production aircraft to be powered by the Merlin I and first flew on 10 March 1936. Replaced "ramp" cylinder heads with parallel pattern heads (valves parallel to the cylinder) scaled up from the Kestrel engine. 400 Hour flight endurance tests carried out at RAE July 1937; Acceptance test 22 September 1937. It was first widely delivered as the 1,030-horsepower (770&nbsp;kW) Merlin II in 1938, and production was quickly stepped up. The Merlin II and III series were the first main production versions of the engine. The Merlin III was the first version to incorporate a "universal" propeller shaft, allowing either de Havilland or Rotol manufactured propellers to be used.Fozard 1991, p. 125. The first major version to incorporate changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX, which was designed to run on 100 octane fuel. This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures, which were achieved by increasing the boost from the centrifugal supercharger. The Merlin XX also utilised the two-speed superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, introduced with the Merlin X, was the use of a 70%–30% water-glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life and reliability, removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol, and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I, II and III series.Fozard 1991, pp. 127, 165. The process of improvement continued, with later versions running on higher octane ratings, delivering more power. Fundamental design changes were also made to all key components, again increasing the engine's life and reliability. By the end of the war the "little" engine was delivering over 1,600 horsepower (1,200&nbsp;kW) in common versions, and as much as 2,030 horsepower (1,540&nbsp;kW) in the Merlin 130/131 versions specifically designed for the de Havilland Hornet.Flight January 1946, p. 93. Ultimately, during tests conducted by Rolls-Royce at Derby, an RM.17.SM achieved 2,640 horsepower (1,969&nbsp;kW) at 36&nbsp;lb boost (103"Hg) on 150 octane fuel with water injection.Lovesey 1946, p. 223. With the end of the war, work on improving Merlin power output was halted and the development effort was concentrated on civil derivatives of the Merlin.Lovesey 1946, p. 224. From Jane's:Bridgman 1998, pp. 280–281. Most of the Merlin's technical improvements resulted from more efficient superchargers, designed by Stanley Hooker, and the introduction of aviation spirits with increased octane ratings. Numerous detail changes were made internally and externally to the engine to withstand increased power ratings and to incorporate advances in engineering practices.Lovesey 1946, pp. 224–226.  The Merlin consumed an enormous volume of air at full power (equivalent to the volume of a single-decker bus per minute), and with the exhaust gases exiting at 1,300&nbsp;mph (2,100&nbsp;km/h) it was realised that useful thrust could be gained simply by angling the gases backwards instead of venting sideways. During tests, 70 pounds-force (310 N; 32&nbsp;kgf) thrust at , or roughly 70 horsepower (52&nbsp;kW) was obtained which increased the level maximum speed of the Spitfire by  to .Price 1982, p. 51. The first versions of the ejector exhausts featured round outlets, while subsequent versions of the system used "fishtail" style outlets which marginally increased thrust and reduced exhaust glare for night flying. In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, K5054, was fitted with ejector type exhausts. Later marks of the Spitfire used a variation of this exhaust system fitted with forward-facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing-mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high altitudes, replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the engine coolant radiator. The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower.Tanner 1981, A.P.1565E, Vol.1, Section II. Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft. Central to the success of the Merlin was the supercharger. A.C. Lovesey, an engineer who was a key figure in the design of the Merlin, delivered a lecture on the development of the Merlin in 1946; in this extract he explained the importance of the supercharger:  As the Merlin evolved so too did the supercharger; the latter fitting into three broad categories:Lumsden 2003, p. 201. The Merlin supercharger was originally designed to allow the engine to generate maximum power at an altitude of about . In 1938 Stanley Hooker, an Oxford graduate in applied mathematics, explained "... I soon became very familiar with the construction of the Merlin supercharger and carburettor&nbsp;... Since the supercharger was at the rear of the engine it had come in for pretty severe design treatment, and the air intake duct to the impeller looked very squashed&nbsp;..." Tests conducted by Hooker showed the original intake design was inefficient, limiting the performance of the supercharger.Hooker 1984, p. 45. Hooker subsequently designed a new air intake duct with improved flow characteristics which increased maximum power at a higher altitude of over ; and also improved the design of both the impeller, and the diffuser which controlled the airflow to it. These modifications led to the development of the single-stage Merlin XX and 45 series.Hooker 1984, pp. 46–50, 52, 235–247. A significant advance in supercharger design was the incorporation in 1938 of a two-speed drive (designed by the French company Farman) to the impeller of the Merlin X.Lumsden 2003, p. 206. The later Merlin XX incorporated the two-speed drive as well as several improvements that enabled the production rate of Merlins to be increased.Smith February 1942 p. b. The low-ratio gear, which operated from takeoff to an altitude of , drove the impeller at 21,597 rpm and developed 1,240 horsepower (925&nbsp;kW) at that height; while the high gear's (25,148 rpm) power rating was 1,175 horsepower (876&nbsp;kW) at . These figures were achieved at 2,850 rpm engine speed using +9 pounds per square inch (1.66&nbsp;atm)(48") boost.Smith February 1942 p. d. In 1940, after receiving a request in March of that year from the Ministry of Aircraft Production for a high-rated () Merlin for use as an alternative engine to the turbocharged Hercules VIII used in the prototype high-altitude Vickers Wellington V bomber, Rolls-Royce started experiments on the design of a two-stage supercharger and an engine fitted with this was bench-tested in April 1941, eventually becoming the Merlin 60.King 1954, p. 578. The basic design used a modified Vulture supercharger for the first stage while a Merlin 46 supercharger was used for the second.Lovesey 1946, p. 220. A liquid-cooled intercooler on top of the supercharger casing was used to prevent the compressed air/fuel mixture from becoming too hot. Also considered was an exhaust-driven turbocharger but, although a lower fuel consumption was an advantage the added weight and the need to add extra ducting for the exhaust flow and waste-gates, meant that this option was rejected in favour of the two-stage supercharger.Lovesey 1946, p. 219.  Fitted with the two-stage two-speed supercharger, the Merlin 60 series gained 300 horsepower (224&nbsp;kW) at  over the Merlin 45 series, at which altitude a Spitfire IX was nearly  faster than a Spitfire V.Price 1982, pp. 142, 167. The two-stage Merlin family was extended in 1943 with the Merlin 66 which had its supercharger geared for increased power ratings at low altitudes, and the Merlin 70 series that were designed to deliver increased power at high altitudes.Price 1982, pp. 153–154, 170. While the design of the two-stage supercharger forged ahead, Rolls-Royce also continued to develop the single-stage supercharger, resulting in 1942 in the development of a smaller "cropped" impeller for the Merlin 45M and 55M; both of these engines developed greater power at low altitudes.Lumsden 2003, p. 210. In squadron service the LF.V variant of the Spitfire fitted with these engines became known as the "clipped, clapped, and cropped Spitty" to indicate the shortened wingspan, the less-than-perfect condition of the used airframes, and the cropped supercharger impeller.Price 1982, p. 135.  The use of carburettors was calculated to give a higher specific power output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems.Hooker 1984, p. 62. However, the Merlin's float controlled carburettor meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary Bf 109E, which had direct fuel injection, could "bunt" into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been forced out of the carburettor's float chamber by the effects of negative g-force (g). RAF fighter pilots soon learned to "half-roll" their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents.McKinstry 2007, p. 205. "Miss Shilling's orifice", a restrictor in the fuel supply line to restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in the float chamber to contain fuel under negative G, went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet from the bottom of the S.U. carburettor to exactly halfway up the side, which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g.Smallwood 1996, p. 135. Further improvements were introduced throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw the introduction of a Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at 5 pounds per square inch (34&nbsp;kPa; 0.34 bar) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger, and was fitted to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was fitted to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.Lumsden 2003, p. 212.  At the start of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then standard 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750&nbsp;kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cu&nbsp;in) displacement: the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 pounds per square inch (141&nbsp;kPa; 1.44&nbsp;atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943&nbsp;kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400&nbsp;m), 1,285 horsepower (958&nbsp;kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800&nbsp;m) and 1,320 horsepower (984&nbsp;kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857&nbsp;kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700&nbsp;m) and 1,160 horsepower (865&nbsp;kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100&nbsp;m).Flight 1938, p. 528. From late 1939, 100 octane fuel became available from the U.S., West Indies, Persia, and, in smaller quantities, domestically,Payton-Smith 1971, pp. 259–260. consequently, "...in the first half of 1940 the RAF transferred all Hurricane and Spitfire squadrons to 100 octane fuel."Lloyd, p.139 Small modifications were made to Merlin II and III series engines, allowing an increased (emergency) boost pressure of +12 pounds per square inch (183&nbsp;kPa; 1.85&nbsp;atm). At this power setting these engines were able to produce 1,310 horsepower (977&nbsp;kW) at  while running at 3,000 revolutions per minute.Gunston, p. 144. The increased boost was available for a maximum of five minutes and was considered a "definite overload condition on the engine"; if the pilot resorted to emergency boost he had to report this on landing, when it was noted in the engine log book, while the engineering officer was required to examine the engine and reset the throttle gate.Air Ministry 1940. Later versions of the Merlin ran only on 100 octane fuel and the five-minute combat limitation was raised to +18 pounds per square inch (224&nbsp;kPa; 2.3&nbsp;atm).Air Ministry 1943, p. 25. In late 1943 trials were run of a new "100/150" grade (150 octane) fuel, recognised by its bright-green colour and "awful smell".McKinstry 2007, p. 356. Initial tests were conducted using  of tetraethyllead (T.E.L.) for every one imperial gallon of 100 octane fuel (or 1.43&nbsp;cc/L or 0.18&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;fl&nbsp;oz/U.S.&nbsp;gal), but this mixture resulted in a build-up of lead in the combustion chambers, causing excessive fouling of the spark plugs. Better results were achieved by adding 2.5% mono methyl aniline (M.M.A.) to 100 octane fuel.Lovesey 1946, pp. 222–223. The new fuel allowed the five-minute boost rating of the Merlin 66 to be raised to +25 pounds per square inch (272&nbsp;kPa; 2.7&nbsp;atm).Price 1982. p. 170. With this boost rating the Merlin 66 generated 2,000&nbsp;hp (1,491&nbsp;Kw) at sea-level and 1,860&nbsp;hp (1,387&nbsp;Kw) at .Wilkinson 1946, p. 195. Starting in March 1944, the Merlin 66-powered Spitfire IXs of two Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) squadrons were cleared to use the new fuel for operational trials, and it was put to good use in the summer of 1944 when it enabled Spitfire L.F. Mk. IXs to intercept V-1 flying bombs coming in at low altitudes. 100/150 grade fuel was also used by Mosquito night fighters of the ADGB to intercept V-1s.Simons 2011, pp. 126–127. In early February 1945, Spitfires of the 2 TAF also began using 100/150 grade fuel.Berger and Street 1994. p. 199. Production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin was driven by the forethought and determination of Ernest Hives, who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack of urgency encountered in his frequent correspondence with Air Ministry and local authority officials. Hives was an advocate of shadow factories, and, sensing the imminent outbreak of war, pressed ahead with plans to produce the Merlin in sufficient numbers for the rapidly expanding Royal Air Force. Despite the importance of uninterrupted production, several factories were affected by industrial action.McKinstry 2007, pp. 327–329. By the end of its production run in 1950, almost 150,000 Merlin engines had been built; over 112,000 in Britain and more than 37,000 under licence in the U.S.  The existing Rolls-Royce facilities at Osmaston, Derby were not suitable for large-scale engine production although the floor space had been increased by some 25% between 1935 and 1939; nevertheless, Hives planned to build the first two- or three hundred engines there until engineering teething troubles had been resolved. Having a workforce that consisted mainly of design engineers and highly skilled men, the Derby factory carried out the majority of development work on the Merlin, with flight testing carried out at nearby RAF Hucknall. Total Merlin production at Derby was 32,377.Gunston 2006, p. 190. The original factory closed in March 2008, but Rolls-Royce plc still maintains a large presence in Derby.Derby factory closure news.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved: 24 August 2009 To meet the increasing demand for Merlin engines, Rolls-Royce started building work on a new factory at Crewe in May 1938, with engines leaving the factory in 1939. The Crewe factory had convenient road and rail links to their existing facilities at Derby. Production at Crewe was originally planned to use unskilled labour and sub-contractors with which Hives felt there would be no particular difficulty, but the number of required sub-contracted parts such as crankshafts, camshafts and cylinder liners eventually fell short and the factory was expanded to manufacture these parts "in house".Pugh 2000, p. 193. Initially the local authority promised to build 1,000 new houses to accommodate the workforce by the end of 1938, but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100. Hives was incensed by this complacency and threatened to move the whole operation, but timely intervention by the Air Ministry improved the situation. In 1940 a strike took place when women replaced men on capstan lathes, the workers' union insisting this was a skilled labour job; however, the men returned to work after 10 days.Pugh 2000, pp. 196–197. Total Merlin production at Crewe was 26,065. The factory was used postwar for the production of Bentley motor cars, and in 1998 Volkswagen AG bought both the marque and the factory. Today it is known as Bentley Crewe.Crewe factory history jackbarclayparts.co.uk. Retrieved: 24 August 2009  Hives further recommended that a factory be built near Glasgow to take advantage of the abundant local work force and the supply of steel and forgings from Scottish manufacturers. This government-funded and -operated factory was built at Hillington starting in June 1939 with workers moving into the premises in October, one month after the outbreak of war, the factory becoming fully occupied by September 1940. A housing crisis also occurred at Glasgow where Hives again asked the Air Ministry to step in.Pugh 2000, p. 197. Having 16,000 employees, the Glasgow factory was one of the largest industrial operations in Scotland. Unlike the Derby and Crewe plants which relied significantly on external subcontractors, it produced almost all the Merlin's components itself.Lloyd and Pugh 2004, p. 61. Engines began to leave the production line in November 1940, and by June 1941 monthly output had reached 200, increasing to more than 400 per month by March 1942.Lloyd and Pugh 2004, p. 69. In total 23,675 engines were produced. Worker absenteeism became a problem after some months due to the physical and mental effects of wartime conditions such as the frequent occupation of air-raid shelters. It was agreed to cut the punishing working hours slightly to 82 hours a week, with one half-Sunday per month awarded as holiday.Pugh 2000, p. 198. Record production is reported to have been 100 engines in one day.End of era for Rolls-Royce plant. news.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved: 25 August 2009 Immediately after the war the site repaired and overhauled Merlin and Griffon engines, and continued to manufacture spare parts. Finally, following the production of the Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet and others, the factory was closed in 2005.Hillington factory history rolls-royce.com. Retrieved: 24 August 2009 The Ford Motor Company was asked to produce Merlins at Trafford Park, Stretford, near Manchester, and building work on a new factory was started in May 1940 on a  site. Built with two distinct sections to minimise potential bomb damage, it was completed in May 1941 and bombed in the same month. At first, the factory had difficulty in attracting suitable labour, and large numbers of women, youths and untrained men had to be taken on. Despite this, the first Merlin engine came off the production line one month later and it was building the engine at a rate of 200 per week by 1943,Nicholls 1996, p. 103. at which point the joint factories were producing 18,000 Merlins per year. In his autobiography Not much of an Engineer,  Sir Stanley Hooker states: "...&nbsp;once the great Ford factory at Manchester started production, Merlins came out like shelling peas&nbsp;...".Hooker 1984, pp. 58–59. Some 17,316 people worked at the Trafford Park plant, including 7,260 women and two resident doctors and nurses. Merlin production started to run down in August 1945, and finally ceased on 23 March 1946.Nicholls 1996, p. 105. Total Merlin production at Trafford Park was 30,428. As the Merlin was considered to be so important to the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order.Time Magazine (8 July 1940)&nbsp;– Business: Ford's Rolls-Royces. time.com. Retrieved: 26 August 2009 Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.Lumsden 2003, p. 202. Total Merlin production by Packard was 55,523. Six development engines were also made by Continental Motors, Inc.  This is a list of representative Merlin variants, describing some of the mechanical changes made during development of the Merlin. Engines of the same power output were typically assigned different model numbers based on supercharger or propeller gear ratios, differences in cooling system or carburettors, engine block construction, or arrangement of engine controls.Bridgman 1998, p. 283. Power ratings quoted are usually maximum "military" power. All but the Merlin 131 and 134 engines were "right-hand tractor", i.e. the propeller rotated clockwise when viewed from the rear. In addition to the mark numbers, Merlin engines were allocated experimental numbers by the Ministry of Supply (MoS) – e.g.: RM 8SM for the Merlin 61 and some variants – while under development; these numbers are noted where possible.Morgan and Shacklady 2000, p. 608. Merlin engines used in Spitfires, apart from the Merlin 61, used a propeller reduction ratio of .477:1. Merlins used in bombers and other fighters used a ratio of .42:1.Harvey-Bailey, 1995, p. 62.

"Universal Power Plant" (UPP) standardised annular radiator installation development of that used on Lancaster VI and Avro Lincoln. The Merlin 620–621 series was designed to operate in the severe climatic conditions encountered on Canadian and long-range North Atlantic air routes. Used in Avro Tudor, Avro York, and the Canadair North Star.Flight July 1946, p. 99. In chronological order, the first operational aircraft powered by the Merlin to enter service were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane, and Supermarine Spitfire.Lumsden 2003, p. 205. Although the engine is most closely associated with the Spitfire, the four-engined Avro Lancaster was the most numerous application, followed by the twin-engined de Havilland Mosquito.Lumsden 2003, pp. 208–209. List from Lumsden 2003Lumsden 2003, pp. 203–215.  At the end of World War II, new versions of the Merlin (the 600- and 700-series) were designed and produced for use in commercial airliners such as the Avro Tudor, military transport aircraft such as the Avro York, and the Canadair North Star which performed in both roles. These engines were basically military specification with some minor changes to suit the different operating environment.Lumsden 2003, pp. 214–215. A Spanish-built version of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-2, the 1954 Hispano Aviación HA-1112-M1L Buchon, was built in Hispano's factory in Seville with the Rolls-Royce Merlin 500/45 engine of &nbsp;– a fitting powerplant for the last-produced version of the famous Messerschmitt fighter, as the Bf 109 V1 prototype aircraft had been powered by the Rolls-Royce Kestrel V-12 engine in 1935.Lumsden 2003, p. 214. The CASA 2.111 was another Spanish-built version of a German aircraft, the Heinkel He 111, that was adapted to use the Merlin after the supply of Junkers Jumo 211F-2 engines ran out at the end of the war.Wilson, Randy. It's a Heinkel: the Luftwaffe's workhorse Heinkel 111 bomber rwebs.net, The Dispatch. Volume 12, Number 4, Winter 1996. Retrieved: 6 September 2009 A similar situation existed with the Fiat G.59 when available stocks of the Italian licence-built version of the Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine ran short.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 211. A non-supercharged version of the Merlin using a larger proportion of steel and iron components was produced for use in tanks. This engine, the Rolls-Royce Meteor, in turn led to the smaller Rolls-Royce Meteorite.Pugh 2000, p. 254. In 1943, further Meteor development was handed over to Rover, in exchange for Rover's gas turbine interests.Harvey-bailey 1995, p.83. In 1938, Rolls-Royce started work on modifying some Merlins which were later to be used in British MTBs, MGBs, and RAF Air-Sea Rescue Launches. For these the superchargers were modified single-stage units and the engine was re-engineered for use in a marine environment. Some 70 engines were converted before priority was given to producing aero engines.Harvey-Bailey 1995, pp. 83-84. Experiments were carried out by the Irish Army involving replacing the Bedford engine of a Churchill tank with a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine salvaged from an Irish Air Corps Seafire aircraft. The experiment was not a success, although the reasons are not recorded.Martin 2002, p. 58. One of the most successful of the World War II era aircraft engines, the Merlin continues to be used in many restored World War II vintage aircraft all over the world. The Royal Air Force Battle of Britain Memorial Flight is a notable current operator of the Merlin. In England the Shuttleworth Collection owns and operates a Merlin-powered Hawker Sea Hurricane IB and a Supermarine Spitfire VC&nbsp;– the Hurricane can be seen flying at home displays throughout the summer months, while the Spitfire is currently undergoing a major restoration.Shuttleworth Collection&nbsp;– Hawker Sea Hurricane IB shuttleworth.org.

Retrieved: 14 August 2009   Many aerospace museums possess examples of the Merlin that are on public display:     Twelve cylinders consisting of high-carbon steel liners set in two, two-piece cylinder blocks of cast "R.R.50" aluminium alloy having separate heads and skirts. Wet liners, ie. coolant in direct contact with external face of liners. Cylinder heads fitted with cast-iron inlet valve guides, phosphor bronze exhaust valve guides, and renewable "Silchrome" steel-alloy valve seats. Two diametrically opposed spark plugs protrude into each combustion chamber. Machined from "R.R.59" alloy forgings. Fully floating hollow gudgeon pins of hardened nickel-chrome steel. Three compression and one oil-control ring above the gudgeon pin, and one oil-control ring below. H-section machined nickel-steel forgings, each pair consisting of a plain and a forked rod. The forked rod carries a nickel-steel bearing block which accommodates steel-backed lead-bronze-alloy bearing shells. The "small-end" of each rod houses a floating phosphor bronze bush. One-piece, machined from a nitrogen-hardened nickel-chrome molybdenum steel forging. Statically and dynamically balanced. Seven main bearings and six throws. Two aluminium-alloy castings joined together on the horizontal centreline. The upper portion bears the wheelcase, supercharger and accessories; and carries the cylinder blocks, crankshaft main bearings (split mild-steel shells lined with lead bronze alloy), and part of the housing for the airscrew reduction gear. The lower half forms an oil sump and carries the oil pumps and filters. Aluminium casting fitted to rear of crankcase. Houses drives to the camshafts, magnetos, coolant and oil pumps, supercharger, hand and electric starters, and the electric generator. Two inlet and two exhaust poppet valves of "K.E.965" steel per cylinder. Both the inlet and exhaust valves have hardened "stellited" ends; while the exhaust valves also have sodium-cooled stems, and heads protected with a "Brightray" (nickel-chromium) coating. Each valve is kept closed by a pair of concentric coil-springs. A single, seven-bearing camshaft, located on the top of each cylinder head operates 24 individual steel rockers; 12 pivoting from a rocker shaft on the inner, intake side of the head to actuate the exhaust valves, the others pivoting from a shaft on the exhaust side of the head to actuate the inlet valves.
