   Margaret Munnerlyn Mitchell (November 8, 1900 – August 16, 1949) was an American author and journalist. One novel by Mitchell was published during her lifetime, the American Civil War-era novel, Gone with the Wind, for which she won the National Book Award for Most Distinguished Novel of 1936 "5 Honors Awarded on the Year's Books: ...", The New York Times, Feb 26, 1937, page 23. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007). and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937. In more recent years, a collection of Mitchell's girlhood writings and a novella she wrote as a teenager, Lost Laysen, have been published. A collection of articles written by Mitchell for The Atlanta Journal was republished in book form. Margaret Mitchell was a Southerner and a lifelong resident and native of Atlanta, Georgia. She was born in 1900 into a wealthy and politically prominent family. Her father, Eugene Muse Mitchell, was an attorney, and her mother, Mary Isabel "May Belle" (or "Maybelle") Stephens, was a suffragist. She had two brothers, Russell Stephens Mitchell, who died in infancy in 1894, and Alexander Stephens Mitchell, born in 1896. Mitchell's family on her father's side were descendants of Thomas Mitchell, originally of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, who settled in Wilkes County, Georgia in 1777, and served in the American Revolutionary War. Her grandfather, Russell Crawford Mitchell, of Atlanta, enlisted in the Confederate States Army on June 24, 1861 and served in Hood's Texas Brigade. He was severely wounded at the Battle of Sharpsburg, demoted for 'inefficiency,' and detailed as a nurse in Atlanta. After the Civil War, he made a large fortune supplying lumber for the rapid rebuilding of Atlanta. Russell Mitchell had thirteen children from two wives; the eldest was Eugene, who graduated from the University of Georgia Law School.Candler, Allen D., and Clement A. Evans. Cyclopedia of Georgia.

ISBN 0-226-96087-0 The Apache and the Tango were scandalous dances for their elements of eroticism, the latter popularized in a 1921 silent film, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, that made its lead actor, Rudolph Valentino, a sex symbol for his ability to Tango.Groppa, Carlos G.

She found herself engaged to five men, but maintained that she neither lied to or misled any of them.Mitchell, M., et al, A Dynamo Going to Waste: Letters to Allen Edee, 1919–1921, p. 116-118. A local gossip columnist, who wrote under the name Polly Peachtree, described Mitchell's love life in a 1922 column: ...she has in her brief life, perhaps, had more men really, truly 'dead in love' with her, more honest-to-goodness suitors than almost any other girl in Atlanta. In April 1922, Mitchell was seeing two men almost daily; one was Berrien “Red” Upshaw, whom she is thought to have met in 1917 at a dance hosted by the parents of one of her friends, and the other, Upshaw's roommate and friend, John R. Marsh, a copy editor from Kentucky who worked for the Associated Press.Bartley, N.V., The Evolution of Southern Culture, p. 95-96.Walker, M. Margaret Mitchell and John Marsh: the love story behind Gone With the Wind. p. 37 & 80. Upshaw was an Atlanta boy, a few months younger than Mitchell, whose family moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in 1916.Mitchell, M., et al., Lost Laysen, p. 16.  In 1919 he was appointed to the United States Naval Academy, but resigned for academic deficiencies on January 5, 1920. He was readmitted in May, then 19 years old, and spent two months at sea before resigning a second time on September 1, 1920.Washington Government Printing Office (1921), Annual Register of the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Md, p. 57, 188, 193 & 204. Unsuccessful in his educational pursuits and with no job, in 1922 Upshaw earned money bootlegging alcohol out of the Georgia mountains.Bartley, N.V., The Evolution of Southern Culture, p. 95. Although her family disapproved, Peggy and Red married on September 2, 1922, and the best man at their wedding was John Marsh, who would become her second husband. The couple resided at the Mitchell home with her father. By December the marriage to Upshaw had dissolved and he left. Mitchell suffered physical and emotional abuse, the result of Upshaw's alcoholism and violent temper. Upshaw agreed to an uncontested divorce after John Marsh gave him a loan and Mitchell agreed not to press assault charges against him.Mitchell, M., et al, A Dynamo Going to Waste: Letters to Allen Edee, 1919–1921, p. 133. Upshaw and Mitchell were divorced on October 16, 1924.Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. xx. On July 4, 1925, 24-year-old Margaret Mitchell and 29-year-old John Marsh were married in the Unitarian-Universalist Church.Walker, M., Margaret Mitchell and John Marsh: the love story behind Gone With the Wind, p. 125. The Marshes made their home at the Crescent Apartments in Atlanta, taking occupancy of Apt. 1, which they affectionately named "The Dump" (now the Margaret Mitchell House & Museum).Brown, E.F., et al., Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind: a bestseller's odyssey from Atlanta to Hollywood, p. 8.  While still legally married to Upshaw and needing income for herself,Edwards, A., Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell, p. 91. Mitchell got a job writing feature articles for The Atlanta Journal Sunday Magazine. She received almost no encouragement from her family or "society" to pursue a career in journalism, and had no prior newspaper experience.Wolfe, M.R., Daughters of Canaan: a saga of southern women, p. 149. Medora Field Perkerson, who hired Mitchell said: There had been some skepticism on the Atlanta Journal Magazine staff when Peggy came to work as a reporter. Debutantes slept late in those days and didn't go in for jobs. Her first story, Atlanta Girl Sees Italian Revolution,Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. 3-5. by Margaret Mitchell Upshaw, appeared on December 31, 1922.Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. xi. She wrote on a wide range of topics, from fashions to Confederate generals and King Tut. In an article that appeared on July 1, 1923, Valentino Declares He Isn't a Sheik,Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. 152-154. she interviewed celebrity actor Rudolph Valentino, referring to him as "Sheik" from his film role. Less thrilled by his looks than his "chief charm", his "low, husky voice with a soft, sibilant accent",Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. 153. she described his face as "swarthy": His face was swarthy, so brown that his white teeth flashed in startling contrast to his skin; his eyes—tired, bored, but courteous.Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. 152. Mitchell was quite thrilled when Valentino took her in his arms and carried her inside from the rooftop of the Georgian Terrace Hotel.Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. 154. Many of her stories were vividly descriptive. In an article titled, Bridesmaid of Eighty-Seven Recalls Mittie Roosevelt's Wedding,Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. 144-151. she wrote of a white-columned mansion in which lived the last surviving bridesmaid at Theodore Roosevelt's mother's wedding: The tall white columns glimpsed through the dark green of cedar foliage, the wide veranda encircling the house, the stately silence engendered by the century-old oaks evoke memories of Thomas Nelson Page's On Virginia. The atmosphere of dignity, ease, and courtesy that was the soul of the Old South breathes from this old mansion...Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. 144. In another article, Georgia's Empress and Women Soldiers,Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. 238-245. she wrote short sketches of four notable Georgia women. One was the first woman to serve in the United States Senate, Rebecca Latimer Felton, a suffragist who held white supremacist views. The other women were:  Nancy Hart, Lucy Mathilda Kenny (also known as Private Bill Thompson of the Confederate States Army) and Mary Musgrove. The article generated mail and controversy from her readers.Bartley, N.V., The Evolution of Southern Culture, p. 96.Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. xiii. Mitchell received criticism for depicting "strong women who did not fit the accepted standards of femininity."Felder, Deborah G. A bookshelf of Our Own: works that changed women's lives. New York, NY: Citadel Press, 2006. p. 108. ISBN 978-0-8065-2742-0 Mitchell's journalism career, which began in 1922, came to an end less than four years later; her last article appeared on May 9, 1926. Several months after marrying John Marsh, Mitchell quit due to an ankle injury that would not heal properly and chose to become a full-time wife.Jones, A. G., Tomorrow is Another Day: the woman writer in the South, 1859–1936, p. 314. During the time Mitchell worked for the Atlanta Journal, she wrote 129 feature articles, 85 news stories, and several book reviews.Mitchell, M., et al., Margaret Mitchell: reporter, p. xv. Mitchell began collecting erotica from book shops in New York City while in her twenties.Pyron, D. A., Southern Daughter: the life of Margaret Mitchell, p. 200.  She and her friends were flamboyant in 1925. The newlywed Marshes and their social group were interested in "all forms of sexual expression".Walker, M., Margaret Mitchell and John Marsh: the love story behind Gone With the Wind, p. 134.  Mitchell discussed her interest in "dirty" book shops and sexually explicit prose in letters to a friend, Harvey Smith. Smith noted her favorite reads were Fanny Hill, The Perfumed Garden and Aphrodite.Young, E., Disarming the Nation: women's writing and the American Civil War, p. 245. Mitchell developed an appreciation for the works of Southern writer James Branch Cabell, and his 1919 classic, Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice.  She read books about sexology, and took particular interest in the case studies of Havelock Ellis, a British physician who studied human sexuality.Pierpont, C. R., "A Critic at Large: A Study in Scarlett", p. 102.  During this period in which Mitchell was reading pornography and sexology, she was also writing Gone with the Wind.Young, E., Disarming the Nation: women's writing and the American Civil War, p. 249–250. Mitchell wrote a romance novella, Lost Laysen, when she was fifteen years old (1916). She gave Lost Laysen, which she had written in two notebooks, to a boyfriend, Henry Love Angel. He died in 1945 and the novella remained undiscovered among some letters she had written to him until 1994.Mitchell, M., et al., Lost Laysen, p. 7-8. The novella was published in 1996, eighty years after it was written, and became a New York Times Best Seller.BEST SELLERS: June 2, 1996. Retrieved August 27, 2012. In Lost Laysen, Mitchell explores the dynamics of three male characters and their relationship to the only female character, Courtenay Ross, a strong-willed American missionary to the South Pacific island of Laysen. The narrator of the tale is Billy Duncan, "a rough, hardened soldier of fortune",Mitchell, M., et al., Lost Laysen, p. 97. who is frequently involved in fights that leave him near death. Courtenay quickly observes Duncan's hard-muscled body as he works shirtless aboard a ship called Caliban. Courtenay's suitor is Douglas Steele, an athletic man who apparently believes Courtenay is helpless without him. He follows Courtenay to Laysen to protect her from perceived foreign savages. The third male character is the rich, powerful yet villainous Juan Mardo. He leers at Courtenay and makes rude comments of a sexual nature, in Japanese nonetheless. Mardo provokes Duncan and Steele, and each feels he must defend Courtenay's honor. Ultimately Courtenay defends her own honor rather than submit to shame. In a gender reversal, the woman writer (Mitchell) narrates Lost Laysen through a heroic male character, Billy Duncan.Young, E., Disarming the Nation: women's writing and the American Civil War, p. 241. Mitchell's half-breedMitchell, M., et al., Lost Laysen, p. 92. antagonist, Juan Mardo, lurks in the shadows of the story and has no dialogue. The reader learns of Mardo's evil intentions through Duncan: They were saying that Juan Mardo had his eye on you—and intended to have you—any way he could get you!Mitchell, M., et al., Lost Laysen, p. 99. Mardo's desires are similar to those of Rhett Butler in his ardent pursuit of Scarlett O'Hara in Mitchell's epic novel, Gone with the Wind. Rhett tells Scarlett: I always intended having you, one way or another.Mitchell, M., Gone with the Wind, Part 4, chapter 47. The "other way" is rape. In Lost Laysen the male seducer is replaced with the male rapist. In Mitchell's teenage years, she is known to have written a 400-page novel about girls in a boarding school, The Big Four.Mitchell, M., et al., Before Scarlett: girlhood writings of Margaret Mitchell, p. xxii. The novel is thought to be lost; Mitchell destroyed some of her manuscripts herself and others were destroyed after her death. In the 1920s Mitchell completed a novelette, 'Ropa Carmagin, about a Southern white girl who loves a biracial man. Mitchell submitted the manuscript to Macmillan Publishers in 1935 along with her manuscript for Gone with the Wind. The novelette was rejected; Macmillan thought the story was too short for book form.Brown, Ellen F., and John Wiley.

ISBN 978-1-58979-567-9  In May 1926, after Mitchell had left her job at the Atlanta Journal and was recovering at home from her ankle injury, she wrote a society column for the Sunday Magazine, "Elizabeth Bennet's Gossip", which she continued to write until August.  Meanwhile, her husband was growing weary of lugging armloads of books home from the library to keep his wife's mind occupied while she hobbled around the house; he emphatically suggested that she write her own book instead: For God's sake, Peggy, can't you write a book instead of reading thousands of them?Oliphant, Sgt.

For the next three years Mitchell worked exclusively on writing a Civil War-era novel whose heroine was named Pansy O'Hara (prior to publication Pansy was changed to Scarlett). She used parts of the manuscript to prop up a wobbly couch.Williamson, Joel. William Faulkner and Southern History. New York:  Oxford University Press, 1993. p. 244-245. ISBN 0-19-507404-1   During World War II, Margaret Mitchell was a volunteer for the American Red Cross and she raised money for the war effort by selling war bonds.Brown, E.F., et al., Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind: a bestseller's odyssey from Atlanta to Hollywood, p. 225.  She was active in Home Defense, sewed hospital gowns and put patches on trousers.  Her personal attention, however, was devoted to writing letters to men in uniform—soldiers, sailors and marines, sending them humor, encouragement, and her sympathy.Pyron, D. A., Southern Daughter: the life of Margaret Mitchell, p. 518. The USS Atlanta (CL-51) was an anti-aircraft ship of the United States Navy sponsored by Margaret Mitchell and used in the naval Battle of Midway and the Eastern Solomons. The ship was struck and sunk in night surface action on November 13, 1942 during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.USS Atlanta (CL-51), 1941-1942. Retrieved January 22, 2013. Mitchell sponsored a second cruiser named after the city of Atlanta, USS Atlanta (CL-104). On February 6, 1944, she christened  Atlanta in Camden, New Jersey. Atlanta was operating off the coast of Honshū when the Japanese surrendered on August 15, 1945.

Margaret Mitchell was struck by a speeding automobile as she crossed Peachtree Street at 13th Street in Atlanta with her husband, John Marsh, while on her way to see the movie A Canterbury Tale on the evening of August 11, 1949. She died at Grady Hospital five days later without fully regaining consciousness. The driver, Hugh Gravitt, was an off-duty taxi driver who was driving his personal vehicle when he struck Mitchell. After the accident, Gravitt was arrested for drunken driving and released on a $5,450 bond until Mitchell's death.Obituary: Miss Mitchell, 49, Dead of Injuries, (August 17, 1949) New York Times. Retrieved May 14, 2011. Gravitt was originally charged with drunken driving, speeding, and driving on the wrong side of the road. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in November 1949 and sentenced to 18 months in jail. He served almost 11 months. Gravitt died in 1994 at the age of 73.Brown, E.F., et al., Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind: a bestseller's odyssey from Atlanta to Hollywood, p. 270. Perhaps the most enduring legacy of Gone with the Wind is that people worldwide would  incorrectly think it was the true story of the Old South and how it was changed by the American Civil War and  Reconstruction. The film version of the novel "amplified this effect".Williamson, J., William Faulkner and Southern History, p. 245. Scholars of the period  have written in recent years about the negative effects the novel has had on race relations by its resurrection of  Lost Cause mythology.Kennett, Lee.
