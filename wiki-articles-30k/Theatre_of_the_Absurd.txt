 The Theatre of the Absurd ( ) is a designation for particular plays of absurdist fiction written by a number of primarily European playwrights in the late 1950s, as well as one for the style of theatre which has evolved from their work. Their work expressed what happens when human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down, in fact alerting their audiences to pursue the opposite.  Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.The Hutchinson Encyclopedia, Millennium Edition, Helicon 1999. Critic Martin Esslin coined the term in his 1960 essay "Theatre of the Absurd." He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way Albert Camus uses the term in his 1942 essay, "The Myth of Sisyphus". The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man’s reaction to a world apparently without meaning, and/or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. Though the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to Vaudeville, mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the "well-made play". Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, Jean Genet, Harold Pinter, Luigi Pirandello, Tom Stoppard, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Miguel Mihura, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Fernando Arrabal, Václav Havel, Edward Albee and Badal Sarkar. The term was coined by the critic Martin Esslin, who made it the title of a book on the subject first published in 1961 and in two later revised editions; the third and final edition appeared in 2004 (in paperback with a new foreword by the author). In the first edition of The Theatre of the Absurd, Esslin saw the work of these playwrights as giving artistic meaning to Albert Camus's philosophy that life is inherently without meaning, as illustrated in his work The Myth of Sisyphus. In the first (1961) edition, Esslin presented the four defining playwrights of the movement as Samuel Beckett, Arthur Adamov, Eugène Ionesco, and Jean Genet, and in subsequent editions he added a fifth playwright, Harold Pinter—although each of these writers has unique preoccupations and characteristics that go beyond the term "absurd."Martin Esslin, The Theatre of the Absurd (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1961).

Though the label "Theatre of the Absurd" covers a wide variety of playwrights with differing styles, they do have some common stylistic precursors (Esslin [1961]). The mode of most "absurdist" plays is tragicomedy.Esslin, pg. 323–324J. L. Styan. Modern Drama in Theory and Practice.

Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player. Grove Press, 1958. ISBN 0-8021-5024-1. pg. 18–19.  Esslin cites William Shakespeare as an influence on this aspect of the "Absurd drama."Esslin, pg. 321–323 Shakespeare's influence is acknowledged directly in the titles of Ionesco's Macbett and Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. Friedrich Dürrenmatt says in his essay "Problems of the Theatre", "Comedy alone is suitable for us … But the tragic is still possible even if pure tragedy is not.  We can achieve the tragic out of comedy.  We can bring it forth as a frightening moment, as an abyss that opens suddenly; indeed, many of Shakespeare's tragedies are already really comedies out of which the tragic arises."Friedrich Dürrenmatt. "Problems of the Theatre". The Marriage of Mr. Mississippi. Grove Press, 1964. ISBN 978-0-394-17198-2. pg. 30–31. Though layered with a significant amount of tragedy, the Theatre of the Absurd echoes other great forms of comedic performance, according to Esslin, from Commedia dell'arte to Vaudeville.Styan, pg. 126 Similarly, Esslin cites early film comedians and music hall artists such as Charlie Chaplin, The Keystone Cops and Buster Keaton as direct influences (Keaton even starred in Beckett's Film in 1965).Esslin, pg. 325 As an experimental form of theatre, many Theatre of the Absurd playwrights employ techniques borrowed from earlier innovators. Writers and techniques frequently mentioned in relation to the Theatre of the Absurd include the 19th-century nonsense poets, such as Lewis Carroll or Edward Lear;Esslin, pg. 330–331 Polish playwright Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz;Esslin, pg. 382–385 the Russians Daniil Kharms,Neil Cornwell.

One commonly cited precursor is Luigi Pirandello, especially Six Characters in Search of an Author.Annette J. Saddik. Ed. "Experimental Innovations After the Second World War". Contemporary American Drama.Edinburgh University Press, 2007. ISBN 0-7486-2494-5.pg. 28 Pirandello was a highly regarded theatrical experimentalist who wanted to bring down the fourth wall presupposed by the realism of playwrights such as Henrik Ibsen. According to W. B. Worthen, Six Characters and other Pirandello plays use "Metatheatre—roleplaying, plays-within-plays, and a flexible sense of the limits of stage and illusion—to examine a highly-theatricalized vision of identity".Worthen, pg. 702 Another influential playwright was Guillaume Apollinaire whose The Breasts of Tiresias was the first work to be called "surreal".Allan Lewis.

The Alfred Jarry Theatre, founded by Antonin Artaud and Roger Vitrac, housed several Absurdist plays, including ones by Ionesco and Adamov.Esslin, pg. 373.Cornwell, pg.170 Artaud's "The Theatre of Cruelty" (presented in The Theatre and Its Double) was a particularly important philosophical treatise. Artaud claimed theatre's reliance on literature was inadequate and that the true power of theatre was in its visceral impact.Antonin Artaud The Theatre and Its Double.  Tr. Mary Caroline Richards.  New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958., pg. 15–133.Styan, Modern pg. 128Saddik, pg. 24–27.

ISBN 0-521-82908-9. pg. 10 The Theatre of the Absurd is commonly associated with Existentialism, and Existentialism was an influential philosophy in Paris during the rise of the Theatre of the Absurd; however, to call it Existentialist theatre is problematic for many reasons. It gained this association partly because it was named (by Esslin) after the concept of "absurdism" advocated by Albert Camus, a philosopher commonly called Existentialist though he frequently resisted that label. Absurdism is most accurately called Existentialist in the way Franz Kafka's work is labeled Existentialist: it embodies an aspect of the philosophy though the writer may not be a committed follower.Wesley Barnes. The Philosophy and Literature of Existentialism. Barron's Educational Series, 1968. ISBN 0-7641-9154-3. pg. 31–32.  As Tom Stoppard said in an interview, "I must say I didn't know what the word 'existential' meant until it was applied to Rosencrantz.  And even now existentialism is not a philosophy I find either attractive or plausible.  But it's certainly true that the play can be interpreted in existential terms, as well as in other terms."Roger Hudson, Catherine Itzin, and Simon Trussler. "Ambushes for the Audience: Toward a High Comedy of Ideas". Tom Stoppard in conversation. Ed. Paul Delaney. University of Michigan Press, 1994. ISBN 0-472-06561-0. pg. 58. Many of the Absurdists were contemporaries with Jean-Paul Sartre, the philosophical spokesman for Existentialism in Paris, but few Absurdists actually committed to Sartre's own Existentialist philosophy, as expressed in Being and Nothingness, and many of the Absurdists had a complicated relationship with him.  Sartre praised Genet's plays, stating that for Genet "Good is only an illusion. Evil is a Nothingness which arises upon the ruins of Good".Jean-Paul Sartre. "Introduction to The Maids; and Deathwatch" The Maids; and Deathwatch. Grove Press, 1962. ISBN 0-8021-5056-X. pg. 11. Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly.Eugène Ionesco. Present Past, Past Present. Da Capo Press, 1998. ISBN 0-306-80835-8. pg. 63. Ionesco accused Sartre of supporting Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote Rhinoceros as a criticism of blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; at the end of the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinocerosEugène Ionesco. Fragments of a Journal. Tr. Jean Stewart. London: Faber and Faber, 1968. pg. 78.Rosette C. Lamont. Ionesco's imperatives: the politics of culture. University of Michigan Press, 1993. ISBN 0-472-10310-5. pg. 145.  Sartre criticized Rhinoceros by questioning: "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there"."Beyond Bourgeois Theatre" 6Lewis, pg. 275.  Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the (blue, white and red) Absurd and Existentialism: The Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution.Lamont, pg. 67. In a 1966 interview, Claude Bonnefoy, comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical (blue) sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".Claude Bonnefoy. Conversations with Eugène Ionesco. Trans. Jan Dawson. Holt, Rinehard and Winston, 1971. pg. 122–123. In comparison to Sartre's concepts of the function of literature, Samuel Beckett's primary focus was on the failure of man to overcome "absurdity"; as James Knowlson says in Damned to Fame, Beckett's work focuses "on poverty, failure, exile and loss — as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er'&nbsp;."Knowlson, pg. 319  Beckett's own relationship with Sartre was complicated by a mistake made in the publication of one of his stories in Sartre's journal Les Temps Modernes.Knowlson, pg. 325. Beckett said, though he liked Nausea, he generally found the writing style of Sartre and Heidegger to be "too philosophical" and he considered himself "not a philosopher".Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin. Samuel Beckett: the last modernist. Da Capo Press, 1999. ISBN 0-306-80898-6. pg. 231. The "Absurd" or "New Theater" movement was originally a Paris-based (and a Rive Gauche) avant-garde phenomenon tied to extremely small theaters in the Quartier Latin.

Created in the pattern of ancient Greek tragedies, the drama contains only two characters, and carries both poetry and prose in it, and hence fulfills all the requirements necessary for a perfect Absurd drama. Plays within this group are absurd in that they focus not on logical acts, realistic occurrences, or traditional character development; they, instead, focus on human beings trapped in an incomprehensible world subject to any occurrence, no matter how illogical.Styan, Dark 218Saddik, pg. 29Norrish, pg. 2–8.  The theme of incomprehensibility is coupled with the inadequacy of language to form meaningful human connections. According to Martin Esslin, Absurdism is "the inevitable devaluation of ideals, purity, and purpose"Esslin, pg. 24  Absurdist drama asks its viewer to "draw his own conclusions, make his own errors".Esslin, pg. 20 Though Theatre of the Absurd may be seen as nonsense, they have something to say and can be understood".Esslin, pg. 21 Esslin makes a distinction between the dictionary definition of absurd ("out of harmony" in the musical sense) and drama's understanding of the Absurd: "Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose... Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless".Ionesco in Esslin, pg. 23 The characters in Absurdist drama are lost and floating in an incomprehensible universe and they abandon rational devices and discursive thought because these approaches are inadequate.Watt and Richardson 1154 Many characters appear as automatons stuck in routines speaking only in cliché (Ionesco called the Old Man and Old Woman in The Chairs "uber-marrionettes").Lamont, pg. 72http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?id=85&issue=3 Characters are frequently stereotypical, archetypal, or flat character types as in Commedia dell'arte.Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin.

ISBN 0-521-40843-1. 58.Esslin, pg. 402 The more complex characters are in crisis because the world around them is incomprehensible.  Many of Pinter's plays, for example, feature characters trapped in an enclosed space menaced by some force the character can't understand. Pinter's first play was The Room – in which the main character, Rose, is menaced by Riley who invades her safe space though the actual source of menace remains a mysteryKatherine H. Burkman.

Ohio State University Press, 1971 ISBN 0-8142-0146-6, ISBN 978-0-8142-0146-6. pg. 70–73. – and this theme of characters in a safe space menaced by an outside force is repeated in many of his later works (perhaps most famously in The Birthday Party). In Friedrich Dürrenmatt's The Visit the main character, Alfred, is menaced by Claire Zachanassian; Claire, richest woman in the world with a decaying body and multiple husbands throughout the play, has guaranteed a payout for anyone in the town willing to kill Alfred.Roger Alan Crockett. Understanding Friedrich Dürrenmatt.Univ of South Carolina Press, 1998. ISBN 1-57003-213-0, ISBN 978-1-57003-213-4. pg.81 Characters in Absurdist drama may also face the chaos of a world that science and logic have abandoned. Ionesco's recurring character Berenger, for example, faces a killer without motivation in The Killer, and Berenger's logical arguments fail to convince the killer that killing is wrong.Leonard Cabell Pronko. Avant-garde: the experimental theater in France. University of California Press, 1966. pg. 96–102. In Rhinocéros, Berenger remains the only human on Earth who hasn’t turned into a rhinoceros and must decide whether or not to conform.Harold Bloom. Bloom's Major Dramatists: Eugène Ionesco. 2003. Infobase Publishing. p106-110.Robert B. Heilman. The Ghost on the Ramparts. University of Georgia Press, 2008 ISBN 0-8203-3265-8, ISBN 978-0-8203-3265-9. pg. 170–171. Characters may find themselves trapped in a routine or, in a metafictional conceit, trapped in a story; the titular characters in Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, for example, find themselves in a story (Hamlet) in which the outcome has already been written.Bradby, Modern pg. 59Victor L. Cahn. Beyond Absurdity: The Plays of Tom Stoppard. London: Associated University Presses, 1979. pg. 36–39. Cahn asserts that though Stoppard begain writing in the Absurdist mode, in his increasing focus on order, optimism, and the redemptive power of art, Stoppard has moved "beyond" Absurdism, as the title implies. The plots of many Absurdist plays feature characters in interdependent pairs, commonly either two males or a male and a female. Some Beckett scholars call this the "pseudocouple".Ackerley, pg. 334, 465, 508Alan Astro. Understanding Samuel Beckett. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990 ISBN 0-87249-686-4, ISBN 978-0-87249-686-6. pg. 116. The two characters may be roughly equal or have a begrudging interdependence (like Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot or the two main characters in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead); one character may be clearly dominant and may torture the passive character (like Pozzo and Lucky in Waiting for Godot or Hamm and Clov in Endgame); the relationship of the characters may shift dramatically throughout the play (as in Ionesco's The LessonHinden, pg. 401. or in many of Albee's plays, The Zoo StoryLeslie Kane. The language of silence: on the unspoken and the unspeakable in modern drama. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1984. ISBN 0-8386-3187-8. pg. 159–160Lisa M. Siefker Bailey, Bruce J. Mann. Edward Albee: A Casebook. 2003. Routledge. pg. 33–44. for example). Despite its reputation for nonsense language, much of the dialogue in Absurdist plays is naturalistic.  The moments when characters resort to nonsense language or clichés—when words appear to have lost their denotative function, thus creating misunderstanding among the characters—make the Theatre of the Absurd distinctive.Esslin, pg. 26 Language frequently gains a certain phonetic, rhythmical, almost musical quality, opening up a wide range of often comedic playfulness.Edward Albee, Philip C. Kolin. Conversations with Edward Albee. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1988. ISBN 0-87805-342-5. pg. 189.  Jean Tardieu, for example, in the series of short pieces Theatre de Chambre arranged the language as one arranges music.Leonard Cabell Pronko. Avant-Garde. University of California Press, 2003. pg.155–156 Distinctively Absurdist language will range from meaningless clichés to Vaudeville-style word play to meaningless nonsense.Jeanette R. Malkin. Verbal Violence in Contemporary Drama: From Handke to Shepard. Cambridge University Press, 1992. ISBN 0-521-38335-8. pg. 40.  The Bald Soprano, for example, was inspired by a language book in which characters would exchange empty clichés that never ultimately amounted to true communication or true connection.Styan, Dark pg. 221Erich Segal. The Death of Comedy. Harvard University Press, 2001. ISBN 0-674-01247-X pg. 422.  Likewise, the characters in The Bald Soprano—like many other Absurdist characters—go through routine dialogue full of clichés without actually communicating anything substantive or making a human connection.Saddik, pg. 30Guido Almansi, Simon Henderson. Harold Pinter. Routledge, 1983. ISBN 0-416-31710-3. pg. 37. In other cases, the dialogue is purposefully elliptical; the language of Absurdist Theater becomes secondary to the poetry of the concrete and objectified images of the stage.Kane, pg. 17, 19  Many of Beckett's plays devalue language for the sake of the striking tableau.Saddik, pg. 32  Harold Pinter—famous for his "Pinter pause"—presents more subtly elliptical dialogue; often the primary things characters should address are replaced by ellipsis or dashes.  The following exchange between Aston and Davies in The Caretaker is typical of Pinter: ASTON. More or less exactly what you... DAVIES.  That's it … that's what I'm getting at is … I mean, what sort of jobs … (Pause.) ASTON. Well, there's things like the stairs … and the … the bells … DAVIES. But it'd be a matter … wouldn't it … it'd be a matter of a broom … isn't it?Harold Pinter. The Caretaker. DPS, 1991.ISBN 0822201844, pg. 32 Much of the dialogue in Absurdist drama (especially in Beckett's and Albee's plays, for example) reflects this kind of evasiveness and inability to make a connection.  When language that is apparently nonsensical appears, it also demonstrates this disconnection.  It can be used for comic effect, as in Lucky's long speech in Godot when Pozzo says Lucky is demonstrating a talent for "thinking" as other characters comically attempt to stop him: LUCKY.  Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard quaquaquaqua outside time without extension who from the heights of divine apathia divine athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some exceptions for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the divine Miranda with those who for reasons unknown but time will tell are plunged in torment...David Bradby. Beckett, Waiting for Godot. Camberidge University Press, 2001. ISBN 0-521-59510-X, pg. 81. Nonsense may also be used abusively, as in Pinter's The Birthday Party when Goldberg and McCann torture Stanley with apparently nonsensical questions and non-sequiturs: GOLDBERG.  What do you use for pajamas? STANLEY.  Nothing. GOLDBERG.  You verminate the sheet of your birth. MCCANN.  What about the Albigensenist heresy? GOLDBERG.  Who watered the wicket in Melbourne? MCCANN.  What about the blessed Oliver Plunkett? GOLDBERG.  Speak up Webber.  Why did the chicken cross the road?Harold Pinter. The Birthday Party and The Room: Two Plays. Grove Press, 1994. ISBN 0-8021-5114-0. pg. 51. As in the above examples, nonsense in Absurdist theatre may be also used to demonstrate the limits of language while questioning or parodying the determinism of science and the knowability of truth.Raymond Williams. "The Birthday Party: Harold Pinter". Modern Critical Views: Harold Pinter. New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1987. ISBN 0-87754-706-8. pg. 22–23.Marc Silverstein.

In Ionesco's The Lesson, a professor tries to force a pupil to understand his nonsensical philology lesson: PROFESSOR.  … In Spanish: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic; in Latin: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic.  Do you detect the difference?  Translate this into … Romanian PUPIL.  The … how do you say "roses" in Romanian? PROFESSOR.  But "roses", what else? … "roses" is a translation in Oriental of the French word "roses", in Spanish "roses", do you get it? In Sardanapali, "roses"...Eugène Ionesco.

Beckett's theaters: interpretations for performance. Bucknell University Press, 1984. ISBN 0-8387-5064-8. pg. 198.  Often there is a menacing outside force that remains a mystery; in The Birthday Party, for example, Goldberg and McCann confront Stanley, torture him with absurd questions, and drag him off at the end, but it is never revealed why.Kane, pg. 132, 134 In later Pinter plays, such as The CaretakerKatherine H. Burkman. The dramatic world of Harold Pinter: its basis in ritual. Ohio State University Press, 1971. ISBN 0-8142-0146-6, ISBN 978-0-8142-0146-6. pg. 76–89 and The Homecoming,Marc Silverstein.

Bucknell University Press, 1993.ISBN 0-8387-5236-5, ISBN 978-0-8387-5236-4. pg. 76–94. the menace is no longer entering from the outside but exists within the confined space. Other Absurdists use this kind of plot, as in Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance: Harry and Edna take refuge at the home of their friends Agnes and Tobias because they suddenly become frightened.Stephen James Bottoms. The Cambridge Companion to Edward Albee. Cambridge University Press, 2005. ISBN 0-521-83455-4. pg. 221.  They have difficulty explaining what has frightened them: HARRY: There was nothing … but we were very scared. EDNA: We … were … terrified. HARRY: We were scared.  It was like being lost: very young again, with the dark, and lost.  There was no … thing … to be … frightened of, but … EDNA: WE WERE FRIGHTENED … AND THERE WAS NOTHING.Edward Albee. A delicate balance: a play in three acts. Samuel French, Inc., 1994. ISBN 0-573-60792-3. pg. 31. Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and unresolved mysteries are central features in many Absurdist plots:Les Essif. Empty figure on an empty stage: the theatre of Samuel Beckett and his generation. Indiana University Press, 2001. ISBN 0-253-33847-6. pg. 1–9 for example, in The Chairs an old couple welcomes a large number of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible so all we see is empty chairs, a representation of their absence.Alice Rayner. Ghosts: death's double and the phenomena of theatre. U of Minnesota Press, 2006. ISBN 0-8166-4544-2. pg. 120.  Likewise, the action of Godot is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait.  In many of Beckett's later plays, most features are stripped away and what's left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman walking slowly back and forth in Footfalls,Morris Beja, S. E. Gontarski, Pierre A. G. Astier. Samuel Beckett—humanistic perspectives.Ohio State University Press, 1983. ISBN 0-8142-0334-5. pg. 8 for example, or in Breath only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.Alan Astro. Understanding Samuel Beckett. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990. ISBN 0-87249-686-4. pg. 177.Ruby Cohn. A Beckett Canon. University of Michigan Press, 2001. ISBN 978-0-472-11190-9 pg. 298, 337. The plot may also revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis, a supernatural change, or a shift in the laws of physics.  For example, in Ionesco's Amédée, or How to Get Rid of It, a couple must deal with a corpse that is steadily growing larger and larger; Ionesco never fully reveals the identity of the corpse, how this person died, or why it's continually growing, but the corpse ultimately – and, again, without explanation – floats away.Lamont, pg. 101Justin Wintle. The Makers of Modern Culture. Routledge, 2002. ISBN 0-415-26583-5. pg. 243. In Jean Tardieu's "The Keyhole" a lover watches a woman through a keyhole as she removes her clothes and then her flesh.Pronko, pg. 157. Like Pirandello, many Absurdists use meta-theatrical techniques to explore role fulfillment, fate, and the theatricality of theatre.  This is true for many of Genet's plays: for example, in The Maids, two maids pretend to be their mistress; in The Balcony brothel patrons take on elevated positions in role-playing games, but the line between theatre and reality starts to blur.  Another complex example of this is Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead: it's a play about two minor characters in Hamlet; these characters, in turn, have various encounters with the players who perform The Mousetrap, the play-within-the-play in Hamlet.June Schlueter. Metafictional Characters in Modern Drama. Columbia University Press, 1979. ISBN 0-231-04752-5. pg. 53.
