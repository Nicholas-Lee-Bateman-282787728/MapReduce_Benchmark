   Gettysburg College is a private, four-year liberal arts college founded in 1832, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States, adjacent to the famous battlefield. The  campus is located at 300 North Washington Street in the Northwest corner of the town.  Known as the Bullets, the school hosts 24 NCAA Division III men's and women's teams, with a large number of club, intramural, and recreational programs.http://www.gettysburg.edu/facts_figures/glance/ Gettysburg College has about 2,700 students, with roughly equal numbers of men and women. Gettysburg students come from 43 states and 35 countries. In 2012, U.S. News & World Report ranked it 46th among Best Liberal Arts Colleges. In 2015, the Princeton Review ranked Gettysburg College as the 11th in its list of the Best Schools for Internships, only 1 out of 4 liberal arts schools in the top 25.http://www.gettysburg.edu/facts_figures/  It's also consistently rated as one of the most beautiful campuses in the United States, due to its close proximity to the Gettysburg Battlefield National Park.http://www.thebestcolleges.org/most-beautiful-campuses/http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/features/most-beautiful-college-campuses/  The college is the home of The Gettysburg Review, a literary magazine. Gettysburg College was founded in 1832, as a sister institution for the Lutheran Theological Seminary. Both owe their inception to Thaddeus Stevens, a Radical Republican and abolitionist from Gettysburg. The college's original name was Pennsylvania College; it was founded by Samuel Simon Schmucker. In 1839, seven years after Gettysburg College was first founded, Drs. George McClellan (founder of Jefferson Medical College), Samuel George Morton, and others, founded a medical school, Pennsylvania Medical College, which was located in Philadelphia. The school had money troubles within four years, forcing all founding members to leave their posts. After a failed agreement to combine with the Philadelphia College of Medicine in 1858 (closed in 1859, with the faculty begin rolled into Pennsylvania Medical College), the college was forced to close the medical school in 1861. Students from the seceding southern states had withdrawn to return home, leaving it without adequate revenue. In June 1863, southern Pennsylvania was invaded by Confederate forces during the Gettysburg Campaign. Many local militia forces were formed around the area between Chambersburg and Philadelphia to face the oncoming foe. Among these units was Gettysburg's 26th Pennsylvania Emergency Militia Regiment (PEMR). Composed mostly of students from the College and Seminary, the 26th PEMR was mustered into service on June 22, 1863. Four days later, the students saw combat just north of town, skirmishing with advanced units of Confederate division commander Jubal A. Early. Casualties were light on both sides, but about 100 of the militiamen were captured and paroled. During the Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania Hall, or Old Dorm, was used as both a signal corps station and field hospital. Due to the geographic position it held, it was used by both Confederate and Union troops during the battle for signal work and surgery. On November 19, 1863, College President Henry Louis Baugher gave the benediction at the ceremony opening the National Soldiers’ Cemetery at Gettysburg; speaking after Abraham Lincoln. Classes were canceled at the college as students and faculty to hear the now famous Address, establishing the now annual tradition of the "First Year Walk." Henry Baugher was the president of Gettysburg College from 1850 until his death in 1868. Early in his military career, Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie, lived in a house in Gettysburg that was across the street from the college (the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity House until 1955 on N. Washington Street). Both were fond of the town, so they decided to retire to a working farm adjacent to the battlefield after he left the army. It was there that President Eisenhower recuperated from his 1955 heart attack. While living in Gettysburg, Eisenhower became involved with Gettysburg College. He served on the Gettysburg College Board of Trustees, and he was given an office, which he used when writing his memoirs. Eisenhower’s old office is now named Eisenhower House and is occupied by Gettysburg College’s office of admissions. Eisenhower’s grandson, David, and his granddaughter Susan continue a certain level of family involvement with the institution. Today the Eisenhower Institute, a nationally recognized center for leadership and public policy based in Gettysburg and Washington, D.C., is formally recognized as a distinctive program of the college.  The college is located on a  campus adjacent to the Gettysburg National Military Park. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, is 36 miles (60&nbsp;km) from Harrisburg,  from Baltimore,  from Washington, D.C.,  from Philadelphia, and  from New York City, and  from Boston. The college's main campus is roughly divided in half by Pennsylvania Hall (administration). The northern half contains Eddie Plank Gym, Masters Hall (physics and astronomy), Musselman Library, the College Union Building, the College Dining Center, Briedenbaugh Hall (English and Asian Studies), and several first-year residence halls and fraternities. A section of this part of campus known as "Stine Lake" is not actually a lake but rather a quad located outside of the library. Prior to Musselman Library being built in the late 1970s, and due to Gettysburg's wet climate and drainage issues, the quad and library site would be prone to accumulating water, creating a large, muddy "lake" of sorts.  Today, however, Stine Lake does not flood, but the name has stuck, to the confusion of first-year students. Additionally, the College Dining Center is known to students and faculty as "Servo," after a now defunct 1980s food service company, Servonation. The southern half of the main campus includes McKnight Hall (languages), Glatfelter Hall (computer science, management, political science, mathematics, and others), Schmucker Hall (art and music), Kline Theater, and several fraternities. Over the last half-century, the campus has expanded considerably to include land to the east of North Washington Street and to the west of the traditional campus. Since approximately 96% of students live on campus, most of this additional land is dedicated to housing. It also includes the college chapel, the admissions building, a large gymnasium and field house complex, and several athletics fields. The college has also purchased or leased a large number of buildings for student housing, including residences on Washington Street, Carlisle Street, Middle Street, Stratton Street, and others. In 1925, Henry Scharf  built the Majestic Theater as an expansion to the historic Gettysburg Hotel, located in the center of town.  Originally, the building featured a main room that seated 1,200 patrons.  In the 1950s, performances in the Theater were attended by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife, often with world leaders or visitors.  When he was spending the night in his Gettysburg residence, President Eisenhower used the theater's ballroom as an official White House Press Room for news conferences.  The theater was also the location for the world premiere of the civil war epic Gettysburg (1993 film), produced by Ted Turner.http://www.gettysburgmajestic.org/behind_the_scenes/  In November 2005, the theater underwent a $20 million renovation process, with the main room being restored to its former glory and the addition of two new nightly cinemas.  The theater is the location for the college's Sunderman Conservatory of Music performances, as well as musical theater performances and outside guests.  Many traditions and orientation events also occur in the building, which seats 816 individuals in a multi-level main room.http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/conservatory/students/facilities/majestic/ Musselman Library provides access to books, journals, videos, sound recordings, rare books, and manuscripts, many in online format. The online catalog, MUSCAT, is freely available and provides a description of the books, DVDs, and CDs in the collection. The journal locator provides a list of online and print journals in the collection. A list of the online databases is available on the library website. Exhibits are displayed throughout the library and are updated on a regular basis.http://www.gettysburg.edu/library/news/exhibits/current-exhibits.dot The library maintains Gettysburg College's institutional repository, The Cupola: Scholarship at Gettysburg College, a collection of scholarly and creative works produced by faculty, students, and other members of the Gettysburg College community. Special Collections and College Archives, located on the fourth floor of the Library, collects primary sources including rare books, manuscripts, maps, art works, sound recordings, photographs, and other materials which support the curriculum. Special Collections is also home to the College Archives, which preserves records that document College activities, policies, and programs. Rotating exhibits are on display in the Reading Room. Selected items and collections have been digitized and are available via GettDigital. The building was designed by architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen, who intended the building to complement Glatfelter Hall (1889). Jacobsen referred to the architectural style as "abstract Romanesque". The building project commenced thanks to a large gift from the Emma G. Musselman Foundation. Construction began in 1979 and the building opened on April 22, 1981. Books and other materials were transferred from Schmucker Memorial Library to Musselman Library via a human chain of students, faculty and others. In 1986, Jacobsen won both the Award for Excellence in Institutional Masonry Design and the Grand Award for Excellence in Masonry Design for his design of Musselman Library. Gettysburg College is a well respected institution for the musically inclined.  The college is home to the Sunderman Conservatory of Music, which has performed regionally and internationally.http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/conservatory/ensembles/events/asiatour2014/  Schmucker Hall houses four main classrooms, a 225-seat recital hall, a 10 station technology/piano lab, and 16 practice rooms.  Two practice rooms are dedicated organ practice rooms, with a ratio of 6 students for 1 practice room.http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/conservatory/students/facilities/schmucker/  A recording studio is also found within the building's walls.  Choral assemblies usually perform in Christ Chapel, the campus' nondenominational structure that houses a variety of different ceremonies and seats 1,100 individuals. Glatfelter Hall is one of the most iconic buildings on campus.  Built in 1889 as the New Recitation Building, the deep red brick and gray stone building was redicated in 1912 to honor Philip H. Glatfelter, a trustee and generous benefactor of the college.  The building was built in the Romanesque Revival style, with a soaring tower 143 feet high. Currently, the building features four stories and a basement, with a grandiose main staircase traversing all but the top floor.  The building houses the Anthropology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Political Science, and Sociology departments, along with campus management resources.  It is completely handicap accessible, with an elevator traversing all floors. The topmost section of the building contains offices, seminar areas, and a small student library, as well as the entrance to the belltower.  Atop the tower, Glatfelter Hall's bell can be heard across campus, ringing to mark the hour. Renovations: The Science Center is part of a complex of two buildings.  The Science Center itself is the most modern academic building on campus, built in 2002.  An 85,000 sq ft. building,http://www.ba-inc.com/portfolio/gettysburg-college-science-center-mccreary-hall/ the science center was designed to have first-rate scientific equipment, facilities, and resources, and has been continually renovated to include the most up to date material.http://www.pkal.org/facilities/index.cfm?show=project&P_ID=304  It includes: The main building is home to the Chemistry, Environmental Studies, and Health Sciences departments. McCreary Hall is the other building in the complex, and is older but was renovated during the construction of the Science Center and in 2012.  It is home to the Biology and Psychology departments, with the latest equipment including a vast deionized pure water system, infant research lab, space for cognitive neuroscience, and many animal facilities. Masters Hall is home to the physics department, and houses several specialized labs, the largest classroom on campus (Mara Auditorium), a machine shop, and a Physics student lounge.  In addition, the building also includes an indoor planetarium, Hatter Planetarium which gives students glimpses of what the night sky will look like each month.http://public.gettysburg.edu/~iclarke/hatter/  It also has private shows for classes and performances on different, special topics.  Some of the equipment available for student use and regularly used for professor's research includes: In addition, the building houses astronomy classes and uses the campus' observatory, which is located just past the quarry.  The Observatory is used for undergraduate astronomical research and includes a 16-inch f/11 Ealing Cassegrain reflector, computer controlled.http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/physics/facilities/observatory.dot  It also houses a classroom and six Meade telescopes.  Since its construction in 1996, the observatory has been a huge benefit to astronomy students and has even made several star discoveries in the early 2000s.http://public.gettysburg.edu/~marschal/clea/obshome.html Brua Hall is the home of the college's theater department.  Kline Theatre is the building's main attraction, seating 234 people with a thrust stage and an advanced sound and lighting system, including computer lighting memory control.https://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/theatre/facilities/  The stage is home to many performances throughout the year, and is very often used by the theater department in addition to the student run theatre club, the Owl and Nightingale Society.  Brua Hall also has a 48-seat blackbox, which with flexible playing space is constantly converted to fit the needs of the performance.  The blackbox, Stevens Laboratory Theatre, is used for thesis productions from seniors as well as one-act plays written by students.  The building has a fully equipped scene shop facility, stuido and classrom space, dressing rooms, an Actors' Lounge and reception area known as Arms Green Room, and other storage and workroom areas. Large-scale productions are generally performed in the Majestic Theater. Economics and Africana studies are housed in a former house that was fully renovated in 2013, as well as in rooms in Glatfelter Hall. Breidenbaugh Hall and Weidensall Hall are two adjacent buildings that house the English, Asian Studies, Civil War Era Studies, Classics, Education, Globalization Studies, History, Interdisciplinary Studies, Philosophy, and Religion departments.  Weidensall Hall was originally built as a YMCA building, complete with a swimming pool, but was massively renovated in 1987.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK84LlQeAd4  Both buildings feature a revived colonial design, with large columns supporting spacious porches. Full network capabilities in all campus buildings and each residence hall room. Students have access to more than 1,300 computers and a complex system of workstations and laboratories. Wireless connectivity is available across 97% of the campus (the other 3% being the practice fields) and in all of the residence halls. The school provides a large network of technological assistance, known as G-Tech, which is student staffed and IT supported.  It offers free technical services including help with personal computers, removing adware or viruses, connecting to the college network, building computers, accessing school servers, and general troubleshooting assistance.  The college's network infrastructure has been consistently updated over the past decade to keep up with student demand and modernity.  In addition, the technology department has deals for students and faculty to receive discounted personal computers and programs.http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/it/prospectivestudents/ The campus welcomed Google in July, 2012 to open the 225 acre campus to Google Streetview.http://www.gettysburg.edu/visiting_gettysburg/virtual_tour/  Prospective students are able to walk through every inch of campus to see the facilities and fields. Gettysburg College’s Department of Public Safety (DPS) is the primary agency responsible for the enforcement of college policies, security, and emergency response on the campus. The department operates out of 51 W. Stevens St. on the college campus and is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Operated under the supervision of a director (as of 2015, Bill Lafferty), DPS is organized into two divisions, Patrol & Investigative Operations and Life & Fire Safety, each under the management of an Associate Director (as of 2015, Ivan Taylor and David Taylor respectively).  The Patrol & Investigative Operations division provides services including any and all emergency response on campus, building security, patrol, community policing, courtesy vehicle jump-starts, crime prevention initiatives, investigations, traffic and parking enforcement, a lost & found program, security escorts, and special event coverage. Patrols are carried out on foot, on a bicycle, or in a vehicle. DPS is not a sworn agency, and thus officers of the department receive their authority as a designated college official, and operate by enforcing college policies as dictated by the college’s code of conduct. As of 2015, DPS officers do not carry firearms, although some do carry tasers and most are equipped with pepper/OC spray.  The department also operates an emergency (717-337-6911) and non-emergency (717-337-6912) telephone line from their office on campus. The Life & Fire Safety division of DPS monitors and maintains all fire systems at the college, as well as the college’s emergency mass notification system (EMNS). DPS has a healthy and working relationship with local law enforcement agencies including the Gettysburg Borough Police Department, Cumberland Township Police Department, and the Gettysburg Barracks for the Pennsylvania State Police. Law enforcement is requested as necessary by DPS and the Gettysburg Police Department often requests the presence of DPS officers on off-campus properties for assistance if there is a tie to the college. Emergency medical services (EMS) are provided by Adams Regional EMS’s MICU 54-1 and Biglerville Fire Department’s MICU 6-1, when needed. The college falls under Gettysburg’s Volunteer Fire Department’s first-due response area. According DPS’s website, the college employs 20 full-time officers and between 10-15 part-time officers. The structure of the agency includes one major, three lieutenants, one sergeant, and two corporals.  As an independent institution, the college operates under a charter granted in 1832 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The College is governed by a 39-member board of trustees comprising leaders from a range of professions and walks of life. Thirty of the College’s trustees are graduates of Gettysburg. On the student level, adjudication of academic disputes takes place through an Honor Commission, which holds hearings in which students are given a chance to have their say on charges brought against them. The Academic Honor Code has been in effect since 1957, and recently has been updated to fit better with today's technology. In addition to these majors and minors, the college offers several programs.  Students may petition to design their own, individual major.  Students design a curriculum of their own and choose a faculty advisor.  During the senior year, the student takes a 400-level individualized study capstone which is the culmination of their program.http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/ids/programs/individual-major/    An engineering program is offered as a five-year, Dual Degree program in conjunction with Columbia University in New York City, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Engineering students may choose any of these schools to travel to, taking three courses of liberal arts, mathematics, and physics at Gettysburg College, and two years of advanced engineering and physics classes at their chosen University.  Upon completion of the program, students are awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree from Gettysburg College and a Bachelor of Science degree in an engineering discipline from one of the affiliated institutions. A Nursing program, Optometry program, Pre-Healthy program, Interdisciplinary Studies program, and Pre-Law program are all offered as well, in addition to a Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program.

Every year, the media groups on campus work together to host a journalism and media conference entitled Speak Up, Write Out, bringing in members of the world, national, and local media to speak in panels open to students of Gettysburg and other nearby colleges. thumbnail Nearly 2,700 students, approximately one-half men and one-half women and representing 40 states and 35 foreign countries, attend the college.  Almost 60% of graduates will study at least one semester abroad. Some 75% of the student body is from outside Pennsylvania. The Class of 2019 had below a 30% acceptance rate, and often competes with comparable schools Dickinson and Franklin & Marshall for applicants. The college employs 225 full-time faculty, with 100% of the permanent faculty holding a doctorate or highest earned degree in their fields. The student/faculty ratio is 10:1, with an average class size of 18 students. The college hosts one of only 19 chapters of Phi Beta Kappa in Pennsylvania. The college works towards consistent involvement in LGBT involvement and discussion.  Several support groups are available for questioning or struggling students, and the LGBTQA Advocacy and Education office is committed to the creation of an inclusive community where all students are empowered to succeed, regardless of sexuality, gender identity, or gender expression.  The office provides various educational and social programming that works towards the improvement of the campus climate, as well as one-on-one advising and institutional advocacy.  A student run LGBTQA club known as ALLies club originally facilitated LGBTQA discussion and involvement on campus until it was disbanded in late Spring of 2015. The college is currently supporting the foundation of a greater number of smaller, more focused LGBTQA social and advocacy groups. "Q House" is a housing option provided on campus for students who identify as LGBTQA and offers a "safe space" housing option for emergent housing needs as determined by the college's Office of Residential Life. The college boasts a wide variety of different events on campus, with an estimated 3,200 cultural events occurring during a four-year period. There more than 120 clubs and organizations on campus, focusing on community service, art and music, theater and media, academics, student government, career fields, outdoor adventure, and other areas of interests.  These clubs and organizations provide students with over 1,000 leadership opportunities each year, in addition to regular trips to surrounding metropolitan areas.    Students come from a variety of different spiritual backgrounds, with resources for Jewish, Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, Atheist, and Hindu students.  An Interfaith council is regularly held to promote discuss and communication between the different religious groups on campus.  The college provides nondenominational worship in the campus chapel and Glatfelter Lodge, in addition to providing various resources for religious holidays.http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/college_life/religious-spiritual-life/ Gettysburg college has a variety of different traditions during the four year undergraduate experience. On November 19, 1863, students marched through town to the National Cemetery to hear President Abraham Lincoln deliver his now famous Gettysburg Address.  Since then, first year students have annually marched along the same 1 mile path to be welcomed into town and hear the same words spoken over a century ago.  Faculty, students, and townspeople cheer the arriving first years along their walk as the entire town shuts down to participate.http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/college_history/traditions/all.dot Upon completion of the first semester, first year students walk from the college union building to Pennsylvania Hall along paths illuminated by upperclassmen holding candles.  The tradition is designed to welcome first year students into alumni status, and involves the passing of a Class Book to the college president and the singing of the college's Alma Mater. In a twist of events, every Thanksgiving the dining center opens for a Thanksgiving dinner extravaganza.  Students organize themselves and their friends into groups of 8-14 people and receive unlimited turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, pumpkin pie, and more, all served by professors and administrators.  It is common practice for the president of the college to serve a table as well. Every spring, the weekend before finals the college hosts a well known musician on a constructed main stage in Stine Lake.  Other musicians perform in the Attic, the campus' night club.  The end of the term is celebrated with concerts, free food, merriment and play. Twenty-four sports programs, for both men and women, participate in NCAA Division III. Gettysburg has earned the distinction of having the best win/loss record in the Centennial Conference for the past 12 years. The Gettysburg College women's lacrosse team won the Division III National Championship in 2011.   Head football coach Barry Streeter is the winningest coach in school history as well as the longest-tenured coach in the Centennial Conference, having helmed the program since 1979.  He is currently tied for 24th on the All-Time Division III wins list. Twenty-five percent of Gettysburg's students participate in intercollegiate programs, which include twelve sports for men and twelve sports for women. Although the mascot for Gettysburg College is the Bullet, there is no official Bullet mascot at sporting events. The college also offers an extensive array of club, intramural, and recreational programs. The College broke ground on the new $25 million athletic center, named the John F. Jaeger Center for Athletics, Recreation and Fitness, on May 30, 2008. The 55,000 foot Center is an upgrade from the former athletic facility, known as the Bream/Wright/Hauser Complex. Bream/Wright/Hauser still exists next to the additions. The Center opened in stages. A dedication ceremony on April 30, 2010 marked its completion. The Center was officially named for the 1965 alumnus John F. Jaeger on May 4, 2012. The Center features: The Center was created in order to provide more opportunities for the high percentage of students who like to maintain their fitness regimens and engage in intramural, club sports programs, and exercise classes. About 25 percent of the student body participates in varsity sports, while over 75 percent are active in intramural sports. More space was needed, and the Center is important to improve life on campus. John Jaeger, a 1965 Gettysburg College graduate, donated $1.2 million to encourage others to fund the project. Another important donor, Robert Ortenzio, provided the largest single gift by a living person in the history of the College, by giving $2 million.
