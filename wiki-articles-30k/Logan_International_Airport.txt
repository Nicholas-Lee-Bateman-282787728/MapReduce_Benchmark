     Logan International Airport (officially General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport)  is an international airport located in the East Boston neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, (and partly in the town of Winthrop, Massachusetts). It covers , has six runways, and employs an estimated 16,000 people. Logan is the largest airport in New England and 18th busiest airport in the United States, with 33.5 million total passengers in 2015. The airport serves as a focus city for JetBlue, who carries out the largest operations from Logan International Airport, as well as a hub for Delta Air Lines.  The regional airline Cape Air and commuter airline PenAir all carry out hub operations from Boston. Delta Air Lines and American Airlines also carry out many operations from the airport. All of the major U.S. air carriers offer flights from Boston to all or the majority of their primary and secondary hubs. It is also a destination of many major European airlines. Logan Airport has previously served as a hub for American Eagle, Braniff International Airways, and Northeast Airlines, as well as a focus city for AirTran Airways, American Airlines, Continental Airlines,  Continental Connection, Pan American World Airways, Trans World Airlines, and US Airways. The airport has frequent service to destinations throughout North America (including the United States, Canada and Mexico), Latin America, the Caribbean, the Mid-Atlantic region (including Bermuda and the Azores), and Middle East, Europe and Asia. Recently, Logan has seen rapid growth in international traffic, with new routes added by airlines such as Aeromexico, Air Berlin, Cathay Pacific, Copa Airlines, El Al, Emirates, Eurowings, Hainan Airlines, Japan Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines, Turkish Airlines, WestJet Encore, and WOW Air as well as increased traffic on previously existing routes to Europe, Asia and the Middle East.  Logan Airport opened on September 8, 1923, and was used mainly by the Massachusetts Air Guard and the Army Air Corps. It was then called Jeffery Field. The first scheduled commercial passenger flights were on Colonial Air Transport between Boston and New York City in 1927. On January 1, 1936, the airport's weather station became the official point for Boston's weather observations and records by the National Weather Service. Until around 1950 the airline terminal was at 42.367N 71.0275W; on the 1946 topo map the airfield extended less than 5,000&nbsp;ft east from there (the east end of the field was at 42.361N 71.012W NAD83). During the 1940s the airport added  of landfill in Boston Harbor, taken from the former Governors, Noddle's and Apple Islands. In 1943 the state renamed the airport after Lt. General Edward Lawrence Logan, a Spanish–American War officer from South Boston. In 1952, Logan Airport became the first in the United States with an indirect rapid transit connection, with the opening of the Airport station on the Blue Line. The March 1947 diagram shows  runway 4 (future 4L) in use, with runways 9 and 33 under construction; a different runway 33 ran  northwestward from the present intersection of 4R and 9, and runway 25 ran  southwest from the present intersection of 4L and 33. The December 1950 diagram shows a layout similar to the current one:  runway 4L, 10,000-ft 4R, 7,000-ft 9 and 7,650-ft 33. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 49 weekday departures on American, 31 Eastern, 25 Northeast, 8 United, 7 TWA domestic, 6 National, 6 Mohawk, 2 TCA and one Provincetown-Boston. In addition TWA had nine departures a week to or from the Atlantic, Pan Am had 18, Air France 8, BOAC 4 and LAI 4. The jumbo jet era began at Logan in summer 1970 when Pan Am started daily Boeing 747s to London Heathrow Airport. Currently, the Boeing 747-400 is scheduled on flights to Boston by British Airways and Lufthansa; Lufthansa also operates the Boeing 747-8i on one of its daily nonstop flights to Frankfurt. When Terminal E opened in 1974 it was the second largest international arrivals facility in the United States. Between 1974 and 2015, the number of international travelers at Logan has tripled. International long-haul travel has been the fastest growing market sector at the airport. Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) undertook the "Logan Modernization Project" from 1994 to 2006: a new parking garage, a new hotel, moving walkways, terminal expansions and improvements, and two-tiered roadways to separate arrival and departure traffic. Massport's relationship with nearby communities has been strained since the mid-1960s, when the agency took control of a parcel of residential land and popular fishing area near the northwest side of the airfield. This project was undertaken to extend Runway 15R/33L, which later became Logan's longest runway.Nelkin, p. 80–82. Residents of the neighborhood, known as Wood Island, were bought out of their homes and forced to relocate. Public opposition came to a head when residents lay down in the streets to block bulldozers and supply trucks from reaching the construction zone. Runway 14/32 opened on November 23, 2006, Logan's first major runway addition in more than forty years. It was proposed in 1973 but was delayed in the courts. According to Massport records, the very first aircraft to use the new airstrip was a Continental Express ERJ-145 regional jet landing on Runway 32, on the morning of December 2, 2006. In April 2007 the FAA approved construction of a center field taxiway long-sought by Massport. The  taxiway is between, and parallel to, Runways 4R/22L and 4L/22R. News of the project angered neighboring residents. In 2009 the taxiway opened ahead of schedule and under budget. To ensure the taxiway is not mistaken for a runway, "TAXI" is written in large yellow letters at each end.  A scene from the 2006 film The Departed was filmed at Logan, inside the connector bridge between Terminal E and the Central Parking Garage. Terminal C and several United Airlines and Northwest Airlines aircraft can be seen in the background. Parts of the Delta Air Lines 2007 "Anthem" commercial were filmed in Terminal A as well as the connector bridge between Terminal A and Central Parking. In October 2009 US Airways announced it would close its Boston crew base in May 2010. The airline cited an "operations realignment" as the reason. Over 400 employees were transferred or terminated. After starting service to Logan in 2004, JetBlue Airways was a major operator at Logan Airport by 2008 and its largest carrier by 2011, with flights to cities throughout North America and the Caribbean. The airline has plans to expand to 150+ flights by the end of 2015. The Airbus A380 first landed at Logan International Airport for compatibility checks on February 8, 2010. Logan has gained many major international airlines since 2012, especially to Asia and the Middle East. This expansion has resulted in a relatively large increase in passengers, which has soared to over 30 million annually since 2013. Japan Airlines introduced nonstop service from Boston to Tokyo–Narita on April 22, 2012. The Boston-Tokyo route is served by a Boeing 787, making Logan the first airport in the western hemisphere to receive regular 787 service. In July 2013, Copa Airlines began nonstop service from Boston to Panama City aboard a Boeing 737-800. Toward the end of 2013, both Emirates, and Turkish Airlines announced services from Dubai and Istanbul, respectively. Turkish Airlines currently uses the Airbus A340 and Airbus A330 interchangeably on their Istanbul-Boston route. Emirates currently uses a Boeing 777-300ER on their Dubai-Boston route. Initially, the route was operated with a Boeing 777-200LR; Emirates intends to upgauge the service to an Airbus A380 upon completion of Logan's international terminal expansion. In April 2015, Emirates announced a second daily flight to Boston, also aboard a Boeing 777-300ER, that begain in October 2015. Hainan Airlines provides Boston's first ever nonstop service to Beijing; this service uses a Boeing 787 and began on June 20, 2014. Cathay Pacific announced in August 2014 that they will commence nonstop service from Boston to Hong Kong using a Boeing 777-300ER starting in May 2015. The Hong Kong service is the farthest nonstop flight from Logan and the seventeenth-longest nonstop flight in the world. Low-cost Iceland-based airline WOW Air commenced service from Boston to Reykjavik International Airport in March 2015 using an Airbus A321. In November 2014, El Al announced the addition of nonstop service from Boston to their hub in Tel Aviv, that begain in June 2015. The airline has also announced that they will use a Boeing 767-300 on the route. The following month, Aeroméxico announced nonstop service to Mexico City that began in June 2015 using a Boeing 737-700. In February 2015, Hainan Airlines announced an expansion of its service to Boston, adding thrice-weekly nonstop flights to Shanghai Pudong International Airport using two Boeing 787-8s. Service on this route will commence on June 20, 2015. Hainan's existing nonstop service to Beijing was increased from four times weekly to daily on May 1, 2015. In May 2015, Qatar Airways announced commencement of daily service from Boston to the airline's hub in Doha aboard an Airbus A350 XWB, that begain in the following March; introduction of this service makes Logan the second airport in the United States to receive scheduled A350 service. Also in May 2015, Thomas Cook Airlines announced commencement of twice-weekly service from Boston to the airline's hub in Manchester, UK aboard an Airbus A330; this service is scheduled to begin in May 2016. In June 2015, Norwegian Air Shuttle announced seasonal services from Boston to French Caribbean islands of Martinique (Fort de France) and Guadeloupe (Pointe-à-Pitre) aboard Boeing 737s. Also in June 2015, TAP Portugal announced intentions to begin nonstop flights from the airline's Lisbon, Portugal hub to Boston. Facilitated by the airline's new majority shareholder, jetBlue Airways founder David Neeleman, these plans have yet to be rendered official, but operations are expected to commence in 2016. In July 2015, Norwegian Long Haul, a subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, announced intentions to begin four-times-weekly nonstop flights from London's Gatwick Airport beginning in March 2016. The airline intends to utilize a Boeing 787 on the route. Later in the month, WestJet Encore announced new service with 3 daily flights to Toronto's Pearson Airport and a daily flight to Halifax, which will commence in early 2016. In August 2015, Norwegian Long Haul announced an expansion of its future Boston service, including a weekly nonstop service to Copenhagen and a twice-weekly nonstop service to Oslo, both utilizing a Boeing 787. The Oslo flights begin in April 2016, while the Copenhagen flights begin in May 2016. In September 2015, Norwegian Air shuttle announced further expansion of its Boston service: a new nonstop service to Cork utilizing the Boeing 737-800 and will later operate Boeing 737 MAX aircraft is scheduled to commence in May 2016. The Cork service will be the Irish city's first scheduled transatlantic service. Also in September 2015, Eurowings announced new nonstop service between Cologne and Boston utilizing an Airbus A330. In October 2015, Scandinavian Airlines announced new service to Copenhagen. This route will start on March 29, 2016. These flights will be operated daily by PrivatAir, utilitzing the Boeing 737-700 BBJ in a configuration with 20 business class seats and 66 economy class Seats. This will be the second route that will begin in 2016 with service to Copenhagen. In November 2015, Air Berlin announced new service to Düsseldorf, Germany. This route will begin on May 7, 2016 and will be operated by Airbus A330 aircraft. Located partly in East Boston and partly in the town of Winthrop, on Boston Harbor, Logan International Airport covers an area of  which contains six runways: ILS is available for runways 4R, 15R, 22L, 27, and 33L, with runways 4R and 33L are certified for CAT III Instrument Landing operations. The other runways with ILS are certified for CAT I Instrument Landing operations. EMAS pads are located at the starting thresholds of runways 22R and 33L.FAA Airport Diagram. The distinctive central control tower, nearly a dozen stories high, is a local landmark with its pair of segmented elliptical pylons and a six-story platform trussed between them. Logan Airport has two cargo facilities: North Cargo is adjacent to Terminal E and South Cargo adjacent to Terminals A and B. North Cargo is also the location of several maintenance hangars, including those operated by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and JetBlue. Runway 14/32, which officially opened to air traffic on November 23, 2006, is unidirectional. Runway 32 is used for landings and 14 is used for takeoffs. Massport is barred by a court order from using the runway for overland landings or takeoffs, except in emergencies.  There was fierce opposition towards the construction of 14/32 among communities adjacent to the northwest side of the airport, such as Chelsea and East Boston, as authorities acknowledged that these areas would likely see an increase in noise levels. Residents of Winthrop and Revere also joined in opposition, even though Massport had promised that the new traffic patterns allowed by 14/32 would reduce overflights of those areas. Since the opening of the new runway, there has been disagreement about when, and how often, the new runway should be operational. Residents have demanded a minimum of  northwest winds, slightly higher than the  threshold favored by Massport. The new runway reduces the need for the existing Runway 15L/33R, which, at only  is among the shortest hard-surface runways at major airports in the United States. In 1988, Massport had proposed an  extension to this airstrip (a project which would have required additional filling-in of land along a clam bed), but was thwarted by a court injunction. Boston's Hyatt Harborside Hotel, which sits only a few hundred yards from the runway threshold, was built primarily to prevent Massport from ever extending the length of 14/32 or using it for takeoffs or landings over the city. Massachusetts state legislators carefully chose the location of the hotel—directly in the runway centerline—prior to its construction in 1992. The airport is served by several Fixed Base Operators (FBO), which handle fueling, ground handling, aircraft cleaning, cargo service and aircraft maintenance. They include Swissport USA and Ground Service International. General aviation, which is adjacent to the North Cargo area, is handled by Signature Flight Support. Police services are provided by the Massachusetts State Police Troop F. Fire protection is the responsibility of the Massport Fire Rescue. Even though the airport is within city limits, by Massachusetts state law municipal police such as the Boston Police Department do not have jurisdiction on Massport property. A 250-foot zone security zone, established in 2002, surrounds the waters around the airport which are marked by 29 buoys indicating the restricted area. The area is patrolled by the Massachusetts State Police, the Boston Police Department, the Massachusetts Environmental Police, the United States Coast Guard and the Boston and Winthrop Harbormasters. Anyone who enters the zone for non-emergency purposes is subject to prosecution and is entered into a State Police database that tracks offenders. Logan International Airport has 102 gate positions total, divided among four terminals, A, B, C and E. All terminals are connected by pre-security shuttle buses and by the SL1 branch of the MBTA Silver Line BRT, as well as between Terminals A, B and E via pre-security moving walkways. Moving walkways also connect the terminals to a central parking garage designed for consolidated service between all 4 terminals and the garage itself. Massport ultimately plans to connect all terminals and gates post-security, thereby allowing for seamless connections between flights from different terminals. The concession program at the airport is developed, leased and managed by AirMall USA (formerly BAA USA) in Terminals B and E and Westfield Concession Management Inc. in Terminals A and C.   Terminal A, which replaced a 1970s-era building designed by Minoru Yamasaki once occupied by the now-defunct Eastern Air Lines, opened to passengers on March 16, 2005. The terminal, designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, is divided into a main terminal (housing gates A1–A11) and a satellite building (housing gates A13–A22). The main terminal and the satellite building are connected through an underground walkway. Terminal A was originally intended to be entirely occupied by Delta, however, Delta returned 11 of the gates to Massport due to financial reasons. The airline has since reacquired a few of those gates, now operating out of 16 of the terminal's 21 gates. Terminal A features two Delta Sky Clubs. One is located on the third floor of the satellite building, and a newer one opened at the site of the old Continental Airlines Presidents Club in the main terminal building. The building is the first airport terminal in the United States to be LEED certified for environmentally friendly design by the U.S. Green Building Council. Among the building's features are heat-reflecting roof and windows, low-flow faucets and waterless urinals, self-dimming lights and storm water filtration. Southwest Airlines moved to the terminal from terminal E in April 2015 utilizing gates A18 to A22 in the satellite portion of the terminal.  Terminal B, which was designed by John Carl Warnecke & Associates and Desmond & Lord, Inc., opened in 1974. Pier B was completed for US Airways in 1974 and Pier A for American Airlines in 1975. The terminal remained largely unchanged until US Airways expanded its operations at Logan Airport in 1979 and improvements designed by HNTB were constructed in 1980. From 1980 until 2000, numerous small projects including passenger seating area improvements, concessions expansions and passenger lounges were completed at both piers. American's facilities were renovated in 1995 and redesigned by Gresham, Smith & Partners, and US Airways' facilities were renovated in 1998 and 2000, and redesigned by URS Corporation with Turner Construction serving as the construction manager. Until 2014, Terminal B was split into north and south buildings, with a parking garage located between the two buildings. The gates of the south building (primarily occupied by American Airlines and housing an Admirals Club) are divided into three groups: B1–B3, B4–B14 and B15–B19. Gates B1–B3 are the exclusive use of Air Canada. There is a single security lane for these three gates resulting in short wait times. However, to reach other gates in Terminal B including connections to Air Canada's Star Alliance partner United, it is necessary to leave the secure area and re-enter. Post-security, there is only a grab-and-go restaurant and there is no lounge access. As passengers arriving from Canada are pre-cleared by US Customs and Border Protection, passengers do not need to pass through Terminal E's international arrival facility. Gates B4–14 and B15–B19 are connected by a walkway post-security. The gates of the north building (primarily occupied by American Airlines and United Airlines, both of which operate airline lounges in the terminal) are divided into two groups: B20–B36 and B37–B38. Gates B20–29 are used by United Airlines while Gates B30–B36 serve American Airlines. Gates B37 and B38 are home to Virgin America. Between 2012 and 2014, Terminal B underwent a $160 million renovation, which was completed in April 2014. The renovation created a post-security walkway connecting Terminal B North to Terminal B South. The renovation also included 24 new ticket counter spots, eight new departure lounges, new concession space, and a new baggage carousel. United Airlines, formerly located in Terminals A and C, began operating all flights out of Terminal B starting in April 2014.  Terminal C opened in 1967 and was designed by Perry, Shaw, Hepburn and Dean. It was renovated in 1987, 2002 and 2005. It has three groups of gates: C11–C21, C25–C36 and C40–C42. The two Terminal C security checkpoints providing access to Gates C11 through C21 on the left and Gates C25 to C36 on the right were replaced by a common checkpoint on July 20, 2011. Continuing the renovations of Terminal C, Massport has plans to build a post-security connector between gates C11–C36 and C40–C42 which will make all gates accessible through one common security checkpoint. Massport also has plans to build a post-security connector between Terminal C and Terminal E allowing for seamless connections between the two terminals which is part of Massport's plan to ultimately connect all terminals post-security. The Terminal D gates (the three gates at the north end of Terminal C) were renumbered and labeled as part of Terminal E (E1C, E1D & E1E) on February 28, 2006. The three gates were later re-numbered as part of Terminal E and were used by Southwest Airlines until their move to Terminal A. Following the completion of the post-security connector between Terminal C and Terminal E, the gates will be renumbered C8, C9 and C10. The airport's USO Lounge is located in the baggage claim area of Terminal C, lower level. It offers most typical amenities as other markets as major as Greater Boston. Military ID is mandatory. The terminal is also home to the airport's chapel, Our Lady of the Airways, which is considered the first airport chapel in the United States. The chapel was originally Catholic, but is now non-denominational. The chapel has existed in two incarnations. The chapel opened in 1951. The terminal serves JetBlue Airways and its partners Cape Air and Emirates; it also serves Alaska Airlines and Sun Country. Terminal E, also known as the John A. Volpe International Terminal named after the former Governor of Massachusetts and U.S. Secretary of Transportation, serves as the international terminal for Logan Airport. The terminal was completed in 1974 and designed by Kubitz & Papi, Inc. and Desmond & Lord, Inc. Massport completed the "Terminal E Modernization" project in August 1997 which improved the passenger facilities. The International Gateway Project, designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and DMJM Aviation, added 410,000 square feet to the terminal in 2003 and the entire project was completed in 2008. All gates within the terminal are designated as common-use, meaning the gates may be assigned mostly depending on an operational need. All ticket counters and gates in Terminal E are shared among the international carriers. The terminal houses several airline lounges: Aer Lingus' Gold Circle Lounge, Air France's Air France Lounge, British Airways' First Lounge and Terraces Lounge, Lufthansa's Senator Lounge and Business Lounge and Virgin Atlantic's Clubhouse Lounge. The third level of Terminal E is used for departures, the second for passport control, and the ground level for arrivals and customs. The Federal Inspection Station located in Terminal E is capable of processing over 2,000 passengers per hour. Terminal E is currently undergoing a $100 million renovation which started in 2014, it will include a post-security connector between Terminals E and C, improved immigration and passport control kiosks, and gates capable of serving the Airbus A380. The Terminal E expansion will be completed in 2017. Upon completion, there will be a connector created between Terminals E and C, more check-in counters, expanded US Customs facilities, expanded seating areas at gates, more airline lounge space, and three pre-existing gates that will be expanded in order to accommodate A380 and 747-8 aircraft. Airlines currently pursuing larger aircraft operations at Logan Airport for future flights consist of: Lufthansa (747-8), British Airways (A380) and Emirates (A380). Emirates used to fly its departures out of Terminal E, but due to space issues, decided to move to Terminal C, alongside its partner, JetBlue Airways. However, Emirates does use Terminal E for passenger arrivals due to lack of preclearance. Note: All international arrivals (except pre-cleared flights from Canada and the Caribbean) are handled at Terminal E.         Notes For the 12-month period ending January 31, 2010, the airport had 337,229 aircraft operations, an average of 924 per day: 62% scheduled commercial, 33% air taxi and 5% general aviation. As of 2010, Logan is the 19th busiest airport in the United States with about 13.5 million boardings a year (not counting arrivals). In 2010, Logan was the world's 28th busiest airport in terms of aircraft movements. The airport is also the 12th busiest airport in the U.S. based on international traffic. In 2010, it handled 3,681,739 international passengers. In 2012, it handled 4,350,597 international passengers, a 9.8% increase from 2011. Logan Airport stimulates the New England regional economy by approximately $7.6&nbsp;billion per year, generating $559.4&nbsp;million in state and local tax receipts, as of 2006. In 2011, Logan Airport served an all-time high of 28,800,000 passengers, a 5% increase from 2010. In 2010 Logan Airport handled about 27,428,962 passengers, about 3,681,739 of whom were international passengers. JetBlue carried 29.08% of all passengers for the 12-month period ending August 31, 2014; other leading carriers include American Airlines (24.64%), United Airlines (12.90%) and Delta Air Lines (10.77%). These figures do not include Delta Connection which has significant operations at Logan Airport. Logan Airport also handled over  of cargo and mail. , Logan ranks 14th among major U.S. airports for on-time domestic departures with 80% of domestic flights departing on time. The airport ranks 25th in on-time domestic arrivals with 76% of domestic flights arriving on time. Logan has flights to the Azores because they link Azores American communities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.Nicas, Jack and Susan Carey. "The World's Oddest Air Routes." The Wall Street Journal. October 16, 2012. Retrieved on October 22, 2012. Logan Airport is a medium-sized airport in terms of cargo, handling 684,875 tons of freight in 2012, making it 10th busiest airport in the U.S in terms of cargo. It handles many U.S-based cargo airlines, including ABX Air, DHL, FedEx Express and UPS Airlines. It also has cargo offices for many international cargo carriers, including British Airways World Cargo, Cathay Pacific Cargo, China Airlines Cargo, EVA Air Cargo, LAN Cargo and Saudia Cargo. It has two cargo complexes: The North Cargo Terminal, located near Terminal E, and South Cargo, located near Terminal A. Boston Logan International Airport has the accolade of "Easiest Airport to Get To" in a 2007 article on aviation.com because of the variety of options to/from the airport. These options include cars, taxis, the MBTA Blue and Silver lines, regional bus services, shared ride vans, ferries, limousines and a service offered by few U.S. Airports, Logan Express. Logan is  northeast of downtown Boston, a short distance compared with airports in other cities.  By public roads, the airport is accessible via Exit 26 of the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90), near its eastern terminus, which provides easy access from the west via the Ted Williams Tunnel. East of Exit 26, I-90 transitions to Route 1A to Lynn and New Hampshire. From the south, travellers on Interstate 93 can connect to the Masspike east, through the Ted Williams Tunnel and take exit 26 to reach the airport. From the north, I-93 traffic to the airport uses the Callahan Tunnel, Route 1A North. From the North Shore, access is via Route 1A South. Additionally, road traffic from most of downtown Boston, Back Bay and Fenway/Boston University should use the Callahan Tunnel. The westbound twin tunnel to the Callahan Tunnel is known as the Sumner Tunnel. Eastbound travel through the tunnels is free, but there is a US$3.50 toll for westbound travel, and a $5.25 toll for taxis, which passengers are responsible for.  Massport's Airport Shuttle provides free service between all terminals to Airport station on the Blue Line and the newly opened Rental Car Center as well as additional service to the water transportation dock located on Harborside Drive. Massport's Logan Express bus service serves the areas of Braintree, Framingham, Peabody and the Anderson Regional Transportation Center in Woburn for an adult fare of $12.00 one-way and $22.00 round-trip per passenger. Massport's Logan Express also serves Back Bay station for $5 per passenger or free for riders with a current valid MBTA pass. Logan Express operates on the lower level curb of all terminals. The SL1 branch of the MBTA's Silver Line bus rapid transit service connects all Logan terminals with South Station, a major MBTA Commuter Rail, Amtrak, Red Line subway and intercity bus transportation hub in the downtown Boston financial district. Service on the Silver Line from all Logan Airport terminals to South Station is free. Airport station on the MBTA's Blue Line subway, despite its name, is not in the airport terminal itself; free shuttle buses 22, 33, 55 and 66, provided by Massport, bring passengers from the train station to the terminal buildings. The Blue Line connects with the Orange Line at State, which provides service to North Station, the other major rail transportation hub for Boston. A transfer to the Green Line, which also runs to North Station, was available at Government Center station, but Government Center closed in November 2014 for major reconstruction and will not reopen until 2016; direct transfers between the Blue and Green lines are thus unavailable for the duration of Government Center's closure. The MBTA also operates a water shuttle connecting Logan with downtown Boston, Hingham and Hull. On-demand service from the airport to various locations on the downtown waterfront is provided by a fleet of water taxis.      Limousine pickup is also very common at the airport. Limousine drivers are not allowed to leave their vehicles at the designated pickup areas and pickup locations vary depending on the terminal. For Terminal A, the pickup location is on the arrival level, outside baggage claim, in a small parking lot across the road. For Terminal B, limousine drivers wait for their passengers inside the Terminal B Parking Garage on the lower level. At Terminal C, pickup is on the departure level at the second and third islands from the building. At Terminal E, pickup is also on the arrival level in a small parking lot across the outermost curb. For Public Safety, soliciting passengers anywhere on Logan Airport property by any ground transportation provider is punishable by a $500-dollar fine for each offense. Taxi operations are coordinated at each terminal by Massport. Massport's regulations prohibit taxis from picking up fares at any location other than the designated taxi stands located at curbside on the lower levels of Terminals A, C and E. For both sides of Terminal B, shuttle van services, limos and taxis all wait for passengers inside the Terminal B Parking Garage on the lower level. Signage inside B terminals directs passengers to the various modes of ground transportation. A large Taxi Pool near the South Cargo complex serves as the staging area for up to 400 taxis, which are typically paged to terminal taxi stands in groups of five or ten after waiting for up to ninety minutes or more. Metered-rates from Logan Airport to most Boston hotels range from approximately $23.00 to $35.00. The airport fee for all taxi trips leaving Logan is $2.25 and is entered into the taximeter by the driver. In addition, the full $5.25 Harbor Tunnel Toll is entered into the meter for taxi trips leaving the airport via either the Sumner Tunnel or the Ted Williams Tunnel. The combined fee/toll amount ($7.50) is displayed on the right side of the taxi meter and is automatically added to the metered fare (shown on the left side of the taxi meter) when the taxi has reached the passenger's destination and the meter is stopped. Taxi trips within a 20-mile radius of Boston City Hall (Meter Zone) are charged by running the taximeter. Taxi drivers will quote fare amounts from the Official Boston Police Department Flat-Rate Handbook to destinations outside the 20-mile radius. Additionally, the city of Boston allows its taxis to collect half ($2.75) the Harbor Tunnel Toll on trips to Logan Airport. No airport fee is collected on taxi trips to the airport. As of April 2009, all Boston taxicabs accept fare payment by credit or debit card. The passenger is walked through a series of steps displayed on a touch-screen in the rear passenger compartment of the taxi. Upon request, a meter-generated receipt will be issued.  Logan International Airport offers a 30-minute cell phone waiting lot area at the intersection of Hotel Drive and Service Road, which is complimentary and five minutes from all terminals by car. This convenience service exists to reduce congestion and pollution problems. A  $310 million rental car center opened on September 24, 2013 consolidating all rental car companies into one shared building. Advantage, Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, National and Thrifty rental car companies operate out of the new facility which has 3,200 parking spaces across four levels. Access to the new facility is done through a new unified bus system consisting of 28 fuel efficient clean hybrid buses operated by Massport which provides service between all the terminals and the rental car center. Both Hilton and Hyatt operate hotels on airport grounds near Terminal A, with the latter property overlooking downtown Boston and Boston Harbor.  Currently, major air cargo companies such as British Airways World Cargo, Lufthansa Cargo, Cathay Pacific Cargo, Martinair Cargo, China Airlines Cargo, EVA Air Cargo and many more cargo carriers have cargo offices on Airport property. Also, American Airlines, Delta and JetBlue have maintenance hangars at the airport, all located adjacent to the office building near Terminal E and the North Cargo Terminal. Delta TechOps is Delta Air Lines primary maintenance, repair and overhaul arm. Also located on the property is the Amelia Earhart General Aviation Terminal which is located near Runway 14/32 and next to the Massport Fire Rescue headquarters. The terminal was built in 1980 and dedicated to former Boston resident Earhart in 1984. Until 2006, American Eagle flights flew out of the terminal when all flights were consolidated in the former B22-29 gates in Pier A, the north building of Terminal B. Passengers had to take a shuttle bus from Terminal B to the Earhart Terminal. The terminal currently sits mostly unused. Terminal C is home to the airport's chapel, Our Lady of the Airways, which is considered the first airport chapel in the United States. The chapel was originally Catholic, but is now non-denominational. The chapel has existed in two incarnations. The chapel opened in 1951. To address Logan Airport's overcrowding, Massport has designated two out-of-state airports as the second and third airports of Boston: Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in Manchester, New Hampshire, located approximately  north-northwest of Logan, which converts to an average drive time of 48 minutes via I-93; and T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island, located  south-southwest of Logan, averaging a 1-hour, 8-minute drive to Logan via I-95, or a 75-minute ride on commuter rail from South Station. Massport does not operate these facilities. Worcester Regional Airport in Worcester, which is also operated by Massport, also serves as an alternative to Logan. Currently, JetBlue Airways is the only commercial airline providing service to Worcester.

On November 15, 1961, A Vickers Viscount N6592C of Northeast Airlines was written off when it collided with a Douglas DC-6 N8228H of National Airlines after landing at Logan International Airport. The DC-6 had started to take-off without receiving clearance to do so. On July 31, 1973, Delta Air Lines Flight 723, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, crashed into the seawall, causing the deaths of all 83 passengers and 6 crew members on board. One of the passengers initially survived the accident but later died in a hospital. On November 3, 1973, Pan Am Flight 160, a Boeing 707-321C cargo aircraft, crashed on approach to Boston-Logan. Smoke in the cockpit caused the pilots to lose control. Three people died in the accident. On January 23, 1982, World Airways Flight 30 from Newark to Boston made a non-precision instrument approach to runway 15R and touched down  past the displaced threshold on an icy runway. When the crew sensed that the DC-10-30-CF couldn't be stopped on the remaining runway, they steered the DC-10 off the side of the runway to avoid the approach light pier, and slid into the shallow water of Boston Harbor. The nose section separated as the DC-10 came to rest  past the runway end,  left of the extended centerline. Two passengers (a father and son) were never found and are presumed to have been swept out to sea. On October 2, 1954, a Massachusetts Air National Guard F94 Starfire experienced engine failure and crashed near Logan Airport. Its pilot, First Lieutenant James O. Conway sacrificed his life by veering the plane into an embankment on Bayswater Street in East Boston. A memorial was placed nearby. On July 2, 1976, an unoccupied Eastern Airlines L-188 Electra parked at Boston Logan Airport was destroyed by a bomb planted in the landing gear compartment. No one was injured. On April 3, 1979, a portion of the south wing of Terminal E at Logan Airport was evacuated when an incendiary device triggered a blaze in a third-floor men's room. The two aircraft hijacked in the September 11, 2001 attacks that were flown into the World Trade Center - American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 - originated at Logan. American flags now fly over gates B32 and C19, the respective gates that the two planes pushed back from. On January 7, 2013, ground crew workers noticed smoke coming out from the battery compartment in a parked Japan Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner at the gate. This fire was caused by overcharged lithium-ion batteries, eventually leading to the grounding of the worldwide Boeing 787 fleet and subsequent redesign of the battery systems.
