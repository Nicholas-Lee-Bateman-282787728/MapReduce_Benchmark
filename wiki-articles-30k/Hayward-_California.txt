    Hayward (; formerly, Haywards, Haywards Station, and Haywood) is a city located in Alameda County, California in the East Bay subregion of the San Francisco Bay Area. With a 2014 population of 149,392, Hayward is the sixth largest city in the Bay Area and the third largest in Alameda County. Hayward was ranked as the 37th most populous municipality in California. It is included in the San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont Metropolitan Statistical Area by the US Census. It is located primarily between Castro Valley and Union City, and lies at the eastern terminus of the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge. The city was devastated early in its history by the namesake 1868 Hayward earthquake. From the early 20th century until the beginning of the 1980s, Hayward's economy was dominated by its now defunct food canning and salt production industries. Human habitation of the greater East Bay, including Hayward, dates from at least 4000 B.C.. The most recent pre-European inhabitants of the Hayward area were the Native American Ohlone people.Stanger, Frank M., ed. 1968. La Peninsula Vol. XIV No. 4, March 1968. In the 19th century, the land that is now Hayward became part of Rancho San Lorenzo, a Spanish land grant to Guillermo Castro in 1841. The site of his home was on the former El Camino Viejo, or Castro Street (now Mission Boulevard) between C and D Streets, but the structure was severely damaged in the 1868 Hayward earthquake, with the Hayward Fault running directly under its location. Most of the city's structures were destroyed in the earthquake, the last major earthquake on the fault. In 1930, that site was chosen for the construction of the City Hall, which served the city until 1969. William Dutton Hayward arrived during the gold rush and "squatted", started building a house, next to the creek at the site of the old Polamares School.  Guillermo Castro's Vaqueros came by one day and told Hayward to get off of Castro's property.  William did leave, but went to Guillermo Castro directly and asked to buy a piece of his land.  Castro sold him the area of what was east of Castro Street, now Mission Blvd and north side of A Street.  William Hayward built a grand hotel on the property. He and his wife ran the hotel, which eventually burned to the ground around 1916. Hayward was originally known as "Hayward's", then as "Haywood", later as "Haywards", and eventually as "Hayward". There is some disagreement as to how it was named. Most historians believe it was named for William Dutton Hayward, who opened a hotel there in 1852.Gudde, Erwin G., "California Place Names" (4th Ed. 1998) The U.S. Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System states the city was named after Alvinza Hayward, a millionaire from the California Gold Rush.For example, see Kirkbride, Wayne, "Golden Dreams and the Success that Followed," Sierra Mountain Times,  Retrieved on 2009-04-27; and GeoQuery: Places: USGS Geographic Name Information Server; TerraFly GeoQuery website, Retrieved on April 27, 2009GNIS Detail – Hayward. Geonames.usgs.gov. Retrieved on December 25, 2010. Regardless of which Hayward the area was named for, the name was changed to "Haywood" when the post office was first established in 1860. Castro emigrated to Chile with most of his family in 1864, after he lost his land in a card game. His name survives in the community of Castro Valley, located in the valley next to Hayward, which Castro used to pasture his cattle. The ranch was split up and sold to various locals, William Hayward among them. William Hayward's fortunes took a turn for the grander when he constructed a resort hotel, which eventually grew to a hundred rooms. The surrounding area came to be called "Hayward's" after the hotel. William Hayward eventually became the road commissioner for Alameda County. He used his authority to influence the construction of roads in his own favor. He was also an Alameda County supervisor. In 1876, a town was chartered by the State of California under the name of "Haywards". The name of the post office was then able to change because of the loss of the apostrophe before the "s". This change occurred in 1880. It remained "Haywards" until 1910 when the "s" was officially dropped. William Hayward died in 1891.  Hayward grew steadily throughout the late 19th century, with an economy based on agriculture and tourism. Important crops were tomatoes, potatoes, peaches, cherries, and apricots. Chicken and pigeon raising also played important roles in the economy. A rail line between Oakland and San Jose, the South Pacific Coast Railroad, was established, but was destroyed in 1868 earthquake.http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/pages/Hayward1868.pdf  the Hayward shore of the Bay was developed into extensive salt evaporation ponds, and was one of the most productive areas in the world, with Leslie Salt one of the largest companies.[ ] The first Hayward-San Mateo Bridge opened in 1919, connecting the city to the San Francisco Peninsula.[ ] During the 1930s, the Harry Rowell Rodeo Ranch, now within the bounds of Castro Valley, drew rodeo cowboys from across the continent, and western movie actors such as Slim Pickens and others from Hollywood.  Prior to World War II, Hayward had a high concentration of Japanese Americans, who were subject to the Japanese-American internment during the war. The war brought an economic and population boom to the area, as factories opened to manufacture war material. Many of the workers stayed after the end of the war. Two suburban tract housing pioneers, Oliver Rousseau and David D. Bohannon, were prominent builders of postwar housing in the area. The city's downtown area was slated for redevelopment in 2012 and 2013, with landscaping, new businesses opening up, and older ones getting facade upgrades.[ ] In May 2015, the city's former shoreline landfill was declared a site for conversion to a solar farm, set to generate enough electricity to power 1,200 homes. It will be one of 186 sites in the Regional Renewable Energy Procurement Project.[ ] Mount Eden was a former city that was incorporated into Hayward in the 1950s, at the same time as Schafer Park.GNIS listing for Schafer Park Russell City was a former unincorporated community. It existed from 1853 until 1964. It is now the location of an industrial park. The Russell City Energy Center, a 429 megawatt natural gas-fired power plant, built by Calpine, is located there, having gone online in 2013.Russell City Energy Center Amendment Proceeding.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of .  of it is land and  of it (28.90%) is water. The Hayward Fault Zone runs through much of Hayward, including the downtown area. The United States Geological Survey has stated that there is an "increasing likelihood" of a major earthquake on this fault zone, with potentially serious resulting damage.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BaArAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WPwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5217,4937165&dq=hayward+california&hl=en San Lorenzo Creek runs through the city.

The city received an "AA", and an "AA+" rating for its general obligations, from the Fitch Group in 2012. In July 2012, Hayward began working on an updated 25 year General Plan, with an estimated completion date of June 2014. The city last updated their General Plan in 2002.[ ] The Hayward Hall of Justice, a branch of the California Superior Court, is the largest full-service courthouse in Alameda County. Hayward has a large number of manufacturing companies, both corporate headquarters and plants. This includes some high-tech companies, with Hayward considered part of a northern extension of Silicon Valley. Manufacturing plants in Hayward include Annabelle Candy, Columbus Salame, the Gillig bus company, Impax Laboratories, the Shasta soft drink company, and a PepsiCo production and distribution center. Southland Mall is the largest shopping center in Hayward. The economy of Hayward in the first half of the twentieth century was based largely on the Hunt Brothers Cannery. The cannery was opened in Hayward in 1895 by brothers William and Joseph Hunt, who were fruit packers originally from Sebastopol, California. The Hunts initially packed local fruit, including cherries, peaches, and apricots, then added tomatoes, which became the mainstay of their business. At its height in the 1960s and 1970s, Hunt's operated three canneries in Hayward, at A, B, and C Streets; an adjacent can-making company; a pickling factory; and a glass manufacturing plant. From the 1890s until its closure in 1981, Hunt's employed a large percentage of the local population. The air around Hayward was permeated by the smell of tomatoes for three months of each year, during the canning season. The canneries closed in 1981, as there were no longer enough produce fields or fruit orchards near the cannery to make it economically viable. Much of the production was moved to the Sacramento Valley. The location of the former canneries is marked by a historic water tower with the Hayward logo.[ ]   A housing development now occupies much of the former cannery site. Much of the Bay coastal territory of Hayward was turned into salt ponds, with Oliver Salt and Leslie Salt operating there. Much of this land has in recent years been returned to salt marshes. A 1983 image of the ponds appears on a 2012 U.S. postage stamp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/news/ci_21657101/hayward-photo-by-berkeley-photographer-chosen-stamp |title=Hayward photo by Berkeley photographer chosen for stamp |publisher=Inside Bay Area |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=391165364285196&set=a.159673467434388.40233.156763624392039&type=1&theater |title=Timeline Photos |publisher=Facebook |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref> The [[Mervyns]] department store chain was headquartered in Hayward, until it declared bankruptcy in 2008.  ===Top employers===  According to the city's 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref name="hayward-ca.gov">[http://www.hayward-ca.gov/CITY-GOVERNMENT/DEPARTMENTS/FINANCE/documents/2013/FY2013_Hayward_CAFR.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.hayward-ca.gov/CITY-GOVERNMENT/DEPARTMENTS/FINANCE/documents/2014/FY2014_Hayward_CAFR.pdf]</ref> the top employers in the city, representing 6.5% of total city employment, were:  {| class="wikitable" |- ! # !
