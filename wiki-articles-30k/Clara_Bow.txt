   Clara Gordon Bow (; July 29, 1905 – September 27, 1965) was an American actress who rose to stardom in silent film during the 1920s and successfully made the transition to "talkies" after 1927. Her appearance as a plucky shopgirl in the film It brought her global fame and the nickname "The It Girl". Bow came to personify the Roaring Twenties and is described as its leading sex symbol. She appeared in 46 silent films and 11 talkies, including hits such as Mantrap (1926), It (1927), and Wings (1927). She was named first box-office draw in 1928 and 1929 and second box-office draw in 1927 and 1930.Basinger, Jeanine. A woman's view: how Hollywood spoke to women, 1930–1960, New York: Knopf, 1993Exhibitors Herald, December 31, 1927 Her presence in a motion picture was said to have ensured investors, by odds of almost two-to-one, a "safe return".Press-Telegram, December 10, 1962 At the apex of her stardom, she received more than 45,000 fan letters in a single month (January 1929).Stenn (1988) p. 159 After marrying actor Rex Bell in 1931, Bow retired from acting and became a rancher in Nevada. Her final film, Hoop-La, was released in 1933. In September 1965, Bow died of a heart attack at the age of 60. Bow was born in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn at 697 Bergen Street,Stenn (1988), p. 322 in a "bleak, sparsely furnished room above [a] dilapidated Baptist Church".Morella and Epstein (1976) p. 9 Her birth year, according to the US Censuses of 1910 and 1920, was 1905.In US census records, enumerated in 1910-04-15 and 1920-01-07, Bow's age is stated 4 and 14 years, respectively. The 1930 census indicates 1906Enumeration District 19–822, Bureau of the Census, Population Schedule, April 2, 1930, and on her gravestone of 1965, the inscription says 1907, but 1905 is the accepted year by a majority of sources. Bow was her parents' third child, but her two older sisters, born in 1903 and 1904, had died in infancy.Stenn (1988), p. 8 Her mother, Sarah Frances Bow (née Gordon, 1880–1923), was told by a doctor not to become pregnant again, for fear the next baby might die as well. Despite the warning, Sarah became pregnant with Clara in late 1904. In addition to the risky pregnancy, a heat wave besieged New York in July 1905, and temperatures peaked around . Years later, Clara said: "I don't suppose two people ever looked death in the face more clearly than my mother and I the morning I was born. We were both given up, but somehow we struggled back to life."Bow, Clara. St. Johns, Adela Rogers (ed.) "My life, by Clara Bow" Photoplay (February, March and April 1928). Bow's parents were descended from English-Irish and Scottish immigrants who had come to America the generation before.Stenn (1988) p. 6 Bow said that her father, Robert Walter Bow (1874–1959), "had a quick, keen mind&nbsp;... all the natural qualifications to make something of himself, but didn't...everything seemed to go wrong for him, poor darling". By the time Clara was four and a half, her father was out of work,Morella and Epstein (1976) p. 12 and between 1905 and 1923, the family lived at 14 different addresses, but seldom outside Prospect Heights, with Clara's father often absent.Morella and Epstein (1976) p. 17 "I do not think my mother ever loved my father", she said. "He knew it. And it made him very unhappy, for he worshiped her, always." When Bow was 16, her mother Sarah fell from a second-story window and suffered a severe head injury. She was later diagnosed with "psychosis due to epilepsy".Stenn (1988), p. 26 From her earliest years, Bow had learned how to care for her mother during the seizures, as well as how to deal with her psychotic and hostile episodes. She said her mother could be "mean" to her, but "didn't mean to&nbsp;... she couldn't help it". Still, Bow felt deprived of her childhood; "As a kid I took care of my mother, she didn't take care of me".Morella and Epstein (1976), p. 24 Sarah worsened gradually, and when she realized her daughter was set for a movie career, Bow's mother told her she "would be much better off dead". One night in February 1922, Bow awoke to a butcher knife held against her throat by her mother. Clara was able to fend off the attack, and locked her mother up. In the morning, Bow's mother had no recollection of the episode, and later she was committed to a sanatorium by Robert Bow. Clara spoke about the incident later: On January 5, 1923, Sarah died at the age of 43 from her epilepsy. When relatives gathered for the funeral, Bow accused them of being "hypocrites", and became so angry that she even tried to jump into the grave. Bow attended P.S. 111, P.S. 9, and P.S. 98.Stenn (1988), p. 8 As she grew up, she felt shy among other girls, who teased her for her worn-out clothes and "carrot-top" hair. She said about her childhood, "I never had any clothes. ... And lots of time didn't have anything to eat. We just lived, that's about all. Girls shunned me because I was so poorly dressed."quoted in Savage, Jon. Teenage: The Creation of Youth Culture New York: Viking, 2007. ISBN 978-0-670-03837-4, pp. 237–38. From first grade, Bow preferred the company of boys, stating, "I could lick any boy my size. My right arm was quite famous. My right arm was developed from pitching so much&nbsp;... Once I hopped a ride on behind a big fire engine. I got a lot of credit from the gang for that." A close friend, a younger boy who lived in her building, burned to death in her presence after an accident. In 1919, Bow enrolled in Bay Ridge High School for Girls. "I wore sweaters and old skirts...didn't want to be treated like a girl...there was one boy who had always been my pal... he kissed me... I wasn't sore. I didn't get indignant. I was horrified and hurt." Bow's interest in sports and her physical abilities led her to plan for a career as an athletics instructor. She won five medals "at the cinder tracks" and credited her cousin Homer Baker – the national half-mile champion (1913 and 1914) and 660-yard world-record holder – for being her trainer.Boston Daily Globe, March 23, 1924. The Bows and Bakers shared a house – still standing – at 33 Prospect Place in 1920.1920 United States Census, Kings, NYHomer Baker, 33 Prospect Place, Passport application, No. 20276, June 24, 1920, to compete in the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium. In the early 1920s, roughly 50 million Americans—half the population at that time—attended the movies every week.Kyvig, David E. Daily life in the US, 1920–1939. Greenwood Press Daily Life Through History Series, 2002. p. 79. As Bow grew into womanhood, her stature as a "boy" in her old gang became "impossible". As well, she did not have any girlfriends, and school was a "heartache" and home "miserable." On the silver screen, however, she found consolation; "For the first time in my life I knew there was beauty in the world. For the first time I saw distant lands, serene, lovely homes, romance, nobility, glamor". And further; "I always had a queer feeling about actors and actresses on the screen&nbsp;... I knew I would have done it differently. I couldn't analyze it, but I could always feel it.". "I'd go home and be a one girl circus, taking the parts of everyone I'd seen, living them before the glass."Shippey, Lee. Personal Glimpses of Famous Folks California: Sierra Madre Press, 1929 At 16, Bow says she "knew" she wanted to be a motion pictures actress, even if she was a "square, awkward, funny-faced kid." Against her mother's wishes but with her father's support, Bow competed in Brewster publications' magazine's annual nationwide acting contest, "Fame and Fortune", in fall 1921. In previous years, other contest winners had found work in the movies.Fort Wayne News April 29, 1921. In the contest's final screen test, Bow was up against an already scene-experienced woman who did "a beautiful piece of acting". A set member later stated that when Bow did the scene, she actually became her character and "lived it".Parsons, Louella. "Real life story of Clara Bow" (16 parts) The San Antonio Light,  In the January issues 1922 of Motion Picture Classics, the contest jury, Howard Chandler Christy, Neysa Mcmein, and Harrison Fisher, concluded: Bow won an evening gown and a silver trophy, and the publisher committed to help her "gain a role in films", but nothing happened. Bow's father told her to "haunt" Brewster's office (located in Brooklyn) until they came up with something. "To get rid of me, or maybe they really meant to (give me) all the time and were just busy", Bow was introduced to director Christy Cabanne, who cast her in Beyond the Rainbow, produced late 1921 in New York City and released February 19, 1922.Stenn (1988) p. 287 Bow did five scenes and impressed Cabanne with true theatrical tears, but was cut from the final print. "I was sick to my stomach," she recalled and thought her mother was right about the movie business. Bow, who dropped out of school (senior year) after she was notified about winning the contest, possibly in October 1921, got an ordinary office job.Morella and Epstein (1976), p. 39 However, movie ads and newspaper editorial comments from 1922 to 1923 suggest that Bow was not cut from Beyond the Rainbow. Her name is on the cast list among the other stars, usually tagged "Brewster magazine beauty contest winner" and sometimes even with a picture.See Beyond the Rainbow for an example. Encouraged by her father, Bow continued to visit studio agencies asking for parts. "But there was always something. I was too young, or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat." Eventually, director Elmer Clifton needed a tomboy for his movie Down to the Sea in Ships, saw Bow in Motion Picture Classic magazine, and sent for her. In an attempt to overcome her youthful looks, Bow put her hair up and arrived in a dress she "sneaked" from her mother. Clifton said she was too old, but broke into laughter as the stammering Bow made him believe she was the girl in the magazine. Clifton decided to bring Bow with him and offered her $35 a week. Bow held out for $50 and Clifton agreed, but he could not say whether she would "fit the part". Bow later learned that one of Brewsters' subeditors had urged Clifton to give her a chance.Bow, Clara. "How I broke into the movies" Cato (NY) Citizen, April 27, 1933. Down to the Sea in Ships was shot on location in New Bedford, Massachusetts, produced by independent "The Whaling Film Corporation", and documented the life, love, and work in the whale-hunter community. The production relied on a few less-known actors and local talents. It premiered at "Olympia", New Bedford, on September 25, and went on general distribution on March 4, 1923. Bow was billed 10th in the film, but shone through:   By mid-December 1923, primarily due to her merits in Down to the Sea in Ships, Bow was chosen the most successful of the 1924 WAMPAS Baby Stars.Los Angeles Times, December 17, 1923. Three months before Down to the Sea in Ships was released, Bow danced half nude, on a table, uncredited in Enemies of Women (1923).Morella and Epstein (1976), p. 45 In spring she got a part in The Daring Years (1923), where she befriended actress Mary Carr, who taught her how to use make-up. In the summer, she got a "tomboy" part in Grit, a story that dealt with juvenile crime and was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Bow met her first boyfriend, cameraman Arthur Jacobson, and she got to know director Frank Tuttle, with whom she worked in five later productions. Tuttle remembered: Grit was released on January 7, 1924. The Variety review said "...&nbsp;Clara Bow lingers in the eye, long after the picture has gone."Variety, February 29, 1924. While shooting Grit at Pyramid Studios, in Astoria, New York, Bow was approached by Jack Bachman of independent Hollywood studio Preferred Pictures. He wanted to contract her for a three-month trial, fare paid, and $50 a week. "It can't do any harm," he tried. "Why can't I stay in New York and make movies?" Bow asked her father, but he told her not to worry.Morella and Epstein (1976) p. 47 On July 21, 1923, she befriended Louella Parsons, who interviewed her for The New York Morning Telegraph. In 1931, when Bow came under tabloid scrutiny, Parsons defended her and stuck to her first opinion on Bow: The interview also revealed that Bow already was cast in Maytime and in great favor of Chinese cuisine.New York Morning Telegraph, July 22, 1923. On July 22, 1923, Bow left New York, her father, and her boyfriend behind for Hollywood. As chaperone for the journey and her subsequent southern California stay, the studio appointed writer/agent Maxine Alton, whom Bow later branded a liar. In late July, Bow entered studio chief B. P. Schulberg's office wearing a simple high-school uniform in which she "had won several gold medals on the cinder track".The Davenport Democrat and Leader, September 9, 1923 She was tested and a press release from early August says Bow had become a member of Preferred Picture's "permanent stock".Morning Avalanche, August 5, 1923. Alton and she rented an apartment at The Hillview near Hollywood Boulevard. Preferred Pictures was run by Schulberg, who had started as a publicity manager at Famous Players-Lasky, but in the aftermath of the power struggle around the formation of United Artists, ended up on the losing side and lost his job. As a result, he founded Preferred in 1919, at the age of 27.Schulberg (1981) p. 100 Maytime was Bow's first Hollywood picture, an adaptation of the popular operetta Maytime in which she essayed "Alice Tremaine". Before Maytime was finished, Schulberg announced that Bow was given the lead in the studio's biggest seasonal assessment, Poisoned Paradise, but first she was lent to First National Pictures to co-star in the adaptation of Gertrude Atherton's 1923 best seller Black Oxen, shot in October, and to co-star with Colleen Moore in Painted People, shot in November.Stenn (1988) pp. 39, 289 Director Frank Lloyd was casting for the part of high-society flapper Janet Oglethorpe, and more than 50 women, most with previous screen experience, auditioned. Bow reminisced: "He had not found exactly what he wanted and finally somebody suggested me to him. When I came into his office a big smile came over his face and he looked just tickled to death." Lloyd told the press, "Bow is the personification of the ideal aristocratic flapper, mischievous, pretty, aggressive, quick-tempered and deeply sentimental.Hamilton Evening Journal, March 4, 1924. It was released on January 4, 1924. The New York Times said, "The flapper, impersonated by a young actress, Clara Bow, had five speaking titles, and every one of them was so entirely in accord with the character and the mood of the scene that it drew a laugh from what, in film circles, is termed a "hard-boiled" audience",New York Times, December 2, 1923 while the  Los Angeles Times commented that "Clara Bow, the prize vulgarian of the lot...was amusing and spirited...but didn't belong in the picture".Los Angeles Times, January 13, 1924. and Variety said that "[...] the horrid little flapper is adorably played [...]".Variety, January 10, 1924. Colleen Moore made her flapper debut in a successful adaptation of the daring novel Flaming Youth, released November 12, 1923, six weeks before Black Oxen. Both films were produced by First National Pictures, and while Black Oxen was still being edited and Flaming Youth not yet released, Bow was requested to co-star with Moore as her kid sister in Painted People (The Swamp Angel).Morella and Epstein (1976), p. 59 Moore essayed the baseball-playing tomboy and Bow, according to Moore, said "I don't like my part, I wanna play yours."Stenn (1988) p. 40 Moore, a well-established star earning $1200 a week—Bow got $200—took offense and blocked the director from shooting close-ups of Bow. Moore was married to the film's producer and Bow's protests were futile. "I'll get that bitch", she told her boyfriend Jacobson, who had arrived from New York. Bow had sinus problems and decided to have them attended to that very evening. With Bow's face now in bandages, the studio had no choice but to recast her part.Jacobson (1991) p. 17 During 1924, Bow's "horrid" flapper raced against Moore's "whimsical".Los Angeles Times, May 18, 1924. In May, Moore renewed her efforts in The Perfect Flapper, produced by her husband. However, despite good reviews, she suddenly withdrew. "No more flappers&nbsp;... they have served their purpose&nbsp;... people are tired of soda-pop love affairs", she told the Los Angeles Times, which had commented a month earlier, "Clara Bow is the one outstanding type. She has almost immediately been elected for all the recent flapper parts".Los Angeles Times, April 13, 1924. In November 1933, looking back to this period of her career, Bow described the atmosphere in Hollywood as like a scene from a movie about the French Revolution, where "women are hollering and waving pitchforks twice as violently as any of the guys&nbsp;... the only ladies in sight are the ones getting their heads cut off."Kansas City Star, November 16, 1933. By New Year 1924, Bow defied the possessive Maxine Alton and brought her father to Hollywood. Bow remembered their reunion: "I didn't care a rap, for (Maxine Alton), or B. P. Schulberg, or my motion picture career, or Clara Bow, I just threw myself into his arms and kissed and kissed him, and we both cried like a couple of fool kids. Oh, it was wonderful." Bow felt Alton had misused her trust: "She wanted to keep a hold on me so she made me think I wasn't getting over and that nothing but her clever management kept me going." Bow and her father moved in at 1714 North Kingsley Drive in Hollywood, together with Jacobson, who by then also worked for Preferred. When Schulberg learned of this arrangement, he fired Jacobson for potentially getting "his big star" into a scandal. When Bow found out, "She tore up her contract and threw it in his face and told him he couldn't run her private life." Jacobson concluded, "[Clara] was the sweetest girl in the world, but you didn't cross her and you didn't do her wrong."Jacobson (1991), pp. 15–18 On September 7, 1924, The Los Angeles Times, in a significant article "A dangerous little devil is Clara, impish, appealing, but oh, how she can act!", her father is titled "business manager" and Jacobson referred to as her brother.Los Angeles Times, September 7, 1924. Bow appeared in eight releases in 1924. Loaned out to Universal, Bow top-starred, for the first time, in the prohibition, bootleg drama/comedy Wine, released on August 20, 1924. The picture exposes the widespread liquor traffic in the upper classes, and Bow portrays an innocent girl who develops into a wild "red-hot mama". Alma Whitaker of The Los Angeles Times observed on September 7, 1924: Bow remembered: "All this time I was 'running wild', I guess, in the sense of trying to have a good time&nbsp;... maybe this was a good thing, because I suppose a lot of that excitement, that joy of life, got onto the screen." In 1925, Bow appeared in 14 productions: six for her contract owner, Preferred Pictures, and eight as an "out-loan". Preferred Pictures loaned Bow to producers "for sums ranging from $1500 to $2000 a week"Toledo News-Bee, September 11, 1926 while paying Bow a salary of $200 to $750 a week. The studio, like any other independent studio or theater at that time, was under attack from "The Big Three", MPAA, which had formed a trust to block out Independents and enforce the monopolistic studio system.New York Times, October 29, 1925. On October 21, 1925, Schulberg filed Preferred Pictures for bankruptcy, with debts at $820,774 and assets $1,420.New York Times, October 22, 1925. Three days later, it was announced that Schulberg would join with Adolph Zukor to become associate producer of Paramount Pictures, "...catapulted into this position because he had Clara Bow under personal contract".Brooks, Louise Lulu in Hollywood Arrow Books, 1982. ISBN 0-09-949860-X. p. 21 Adolph Zukor, Paramount Picture CEO, wrote in his memoirs: "All the skill of directors and all the booming of press-agent drums will not make a star. Only the audiences can do it. We study audience reactions with great care."Zukor, Adolph and Kramer, Dale The Public is Never Wrong, New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1953 Adela Rogers St. Johns had a different take: in 1950, she wrote, "If ever a star was made by public demand, it was Clara Bow."St. Johns, Adela Rogers "The Hollywood story", The American Weekly (December 24, 1950) And Louise Brooks (from 1980): "(Bow) became a star without nobody's help&nbsp;..."Louise Brooks in Branlow, Kevin; Gill, David. "Hollywood&nbsp;– Star treatment&nbsp;– Clara Bow", Thames Television, 1980, UK. The Plastic Age was Bow's final effort for Preferred Pictures and her biggest hit up to that time. Bow starred as the good-bad college girl, Cynthia Day, against Donald Keith. It was shot on location at Pomona College in the summer of 1925, and released on December 15, but due to block booking, it was not shown in New York until July 21, 1926. Bow began to date her co-star Gilbert Roland, who became her first fiancé. In June 1925, Bow was credited for being the first to wear hand-painted legs in public, and was reported to have many followers at the Californian beaches.Southeast Missouri, June 24, 1925. Throughout the 1920s, Bow played with gender conventions and sexuality in her public image. Along with her tomboy and flapper roles, she starred in boxing films and posed for promotional photographs as a boxer. By appropriating traditionally androgynous or masculine traits, Bow presented herself as a confident, modern woman.Gammel, Irene. "Lacing up the Gloves: Women, Boxing and Modernity." Cultural and Social History 9.3 (2012), p. 375. "Rehearsals sap my pep," Bow explained in November 1929,Photoplay, November 1929, p. 108. and from the beginning of her career, she relied on immediate direction: "Tell me what I have to do and I'll do it."Jacobson (1991), p. 16 Bow was keen on poetry and music, but according to Rogers St. Johns, her attention span did not allow her to appreciate novels.Clara Bow, the playgirl of Hollywood, Liberty, spring 1975, 1929 retro special Bow's focal point was the scene, and her creativity made directors call in extra cameras to cover her spontaneous actions, rather than holding her down. Years after Bow left Hollywood, director Victor Fleming compared Bow to a Stradivarius violin: "Touch her, and she responded with genius." Director William Wellman was less poetic: "Movie stardom isn't acting ability—it's personality and temperament&nbsp;... I once directed Clara Bow (Wings). She was mad and crazy, but WHAT a personality!"."In Hollywood with Erskine Johnson", Lowell Sunday, April 27, 1952. And in 1981, Budd Schulberg described Bow as "an easy winner of the dumbbell award" who "couldn't act," and compared her to a puppy that his father B. P. Schulberg "trained to become Lassie."Schulberg (1981), pp. 157–58   In 1926, Bow appeared in eight releases: five for Paramount, including the film version of the musical Kid Boots with Eddie Cantor, and three loan-outs that had been filmed in 1925. In late 1925, Bow returned to New York to co-star in the IbsenesqueKoszarski, Richard. Hollywood on the Hudson, Rutgers University Press, 2008. p. 55 drama Dancing Mothers, as the good/bad "flapperish" upper-class daughter Kittens. Alice Joyce starred as her dancing mother, with Conway Tearle as "bad-boy" Naughton. The picture was released on March 1, 1926.Stenn (1988), p. 297 On April 12, 1926, Bow signed her first contract with Paramount: "...to retain your services as an actress for the period of six months from June 6th, 1926 to December 6th, 1926, at a salary of $750.00 per week...".April 12, 1926, Contract Copy, Famous Players-Lasky – Clara Bow agreement In Victor Fleming's comedy-triangle, Mantrap, Bow, as Alverna the manicurist, cures lonely hearts Joe Easter (Ernest Torrence), of the great northern, as well as pill-popping New York divorce attorney runaway Ralph Prescott (Percy Marmont). Bow commented: "(Alverna)...was bad in the book, but—darn it!—of course, they couldn't make her that way in the picture. So I played her as a flirt."The Los Angeles Times, July 15, 1926 The film was released on July 24, 1926.Stenn (1988), p. 299 On August 16, 1926, Bow's agreement with Paramount was renewed into a five-year deal: "Her salary will start at $1700 a week and advance yearly to $4000 a week for the last year." Bow added that she intended to leave the motion picture business at the expiration of the contract, i.e., in 1931. In 1927, Bow appeared in six Paramount releases: It, Children of Divorce, Rough House Rosie, Wings, Hula and Get Your Man. In the Cinderella story It, the poor shop-girl Betty Lou Spence (Bow) conquers the heart of her employer Cyrus Waltham (Antonio Moreno). The personal quality —"It"— provides the magic to make it happen. The film gave Bow her nickname, "The 'It' Girl." Dorothy Parker is often said to have referred to Bow when she wrote, "It, hell; she had Those."Clara Bow Peep, Snopes.com Parker in actuality was not referring to Bow or to Bow's character in the film It, but to a different character, Ava Cleveland, in the novel of the same name.The New Yorker, November 26, 1927. In 1927, Bow starred in Wings, a war picture rewritten to accommodate her, as she was Paramount's biggest star, but was not happy about her part: "(Wings is)..a man's picture and I'm just the whipped cream on top of the pie."Porter, Dawn. Howard Hughes: Hell's Angel, Blood Moon Productions, 2010. p. 147 The film went on to win the first Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1928, Bow appeared in four Paramount releases: Red Hair, Ladies of the Mob, The Fleet's In, and Three Weekends, all of which are lost. Adela Rogers St. Johns, a noted screenwriter who had done a number of pictures with Bow, wrote about her: [T]here seems to be no pattern, no purpose to her life. She swings from one emotion to another, but she gains nothing, stores up nothing for the future. She lives entirely in the present, not even for today, but in the moment. Clara is the total nonconformist. What she wants she gets, if she can. What she desires to do she does. She has a big heart, a remarkable brain, and the most utter contempt for the world in general. Time doesn't exist for her, except that she thinks it will stop tomorrow. She has real courage, because she lives boldly. Who are we, after all, to say she is wrong?  Bow's bohemian lifestyle and "dreadful" manners were considered reminders of the Hollywood elite's uneasy position in high society.Stenn (1988) pp. 116–17, 1988 Bow fumed: "They yell at me to be dignified. But what are the dignified people like? The people who are held up as examples for me? They are snobs. Frightful snobs&nbsp;... I'm a curiosity in Hollywood. I'm a big freak, because I'm myself!""Empty Hearted" by Lois Shirley, Photoplay, October, p. 29, 1929. MGM executive Paul Bern said Bow was "the greatest emotional actress on the screen", "sentimental, simple, childish and sweet," and considered her "hard-boiled attitude" a "defense mechanism".Thornley, Grace. Photoplay, June 1929, p. 36. With "talkies" The Wild Party, Dangerous Curves, and The Saturday Night Kid, Bow kept her position as the top box-office draw and queen of Hollywood.Stenn (1988) pp. 157–162 The quality of Bow's voice, her Brooklyn accent, was not an issue to Bow, her fans, or Paramount. However, Bow, like Charlie Chaplin, Louise Brooks, and most other silent film stars, did not embrace the novelty: "I hate talkies ... they're stiff and limiting. You lose a lot of your cuteness, because there's no chance for action, and action is the most important thing to me."Goldbeck, Elisabeth. "The Real Clara Bow", Motion Picture Classic, September 1930 A visibly nervous Bow had to do a number of retakes in The Wild Party because her eyes kept wandering up to the microphone overhead. "I can't buck progress .. I have to do the best I can," she said. In October 1929, Bow described her nerves as "all shot", saying that she had reached "the breaking point", and Photoplay cited reports of "rows of bottles of sedatives" by her bed.Shirley, Lois. "Empty hearted", Photoplay (October 1929), p. 29.   According to the 1930 census, Bow lived at 512 Bedford Drive, together with her secretary and hair-dresser, Daisy DeBoe (later DeVoe), in a house valued $25,000 with neighbors titled "Horse-keeper", "Physician", "Builder".  Bow stated she was 23 years old, i.e. born 1906, contradicting the censuses of 1910 and 1920. "Now they're having me sing. I sort of half-sing, half-talk, with hips-and-eye stuff. You know what I mean—like Maurice Chevalier. I used to sing at home and people would say, 'Pipe down! You're terrible!' But the studio thinks my voice is great." With Paramount on Parade, True to the Navy, Love Among the Millionaires, and Her Wedding Night, Bow was second at the box-office only to Joan Crawford in 1930. With No Limit and Kick In, Bow held the position as fifth at box-office in 1931, but the pressures of fame, public scandals, overwork, and a damaging court trial charging her secretary Daisy DeVoe with financial mismanagement, took their toll on Bow's fragile emotional health. As she slipped closer to a major breakdown, her manager, B.P. Schulberg, began referring to her as "Crisis-a-day-Clara".Stenn (1988) p. 231 In April, Bow was brought to a sanatorium, and at her request, Paramount released her from her final undertaking: City Streets. At 25, her career was essentially over. B.P. Schulberg tried to replace Bow with his girlfriend Sylvia Sidney, but Paramount went into receivership, lost its position as the biggest studio (to MGM), and fired Schulberg. David Selznick explained: Bow left Hollywood for Rex Bell's ranch in Nevada, her "desert paradise", in JuneNevada State Journal, June 17, 1931 and married him in then small-town Las Vegas in December.Morella and Epstein (1976), p. 259 In an interview on December 17, Bow detailed her way back to health: sleep, exercise, and food, and the day afterSan Antonio Light 311217 she returned to Hollywood "for the sole purpose of making enough money to be able to stay out of it."Morella and Epstein (1976) p. 265 Soon, every studio in Hollywood (except for Paramount) and even overseasNY agent George Frank to Filmjournalen 26/1931 wanted her services. Mary Pickford stated that Bow "was a very great actress" and wanted her to play her sister in Secrets, Howard Hughes offered her a three-picture deal, and MGM wanted her to star in Red Headed Woman. Bow agreed to the script, but eventually rejected the offer since Irving Thalberg required her to sign a long-term contract.The Evening Independent, February 18, 1932 On April 28, 1932, Bow signed a two-picture deal with Fox Film Corporation: Call Her Savage (1932) and Hoop-La (1933).  Both successful, Variety favored the latter. The October 1934, Family Circle Film Guide rated the film as "pretty good entertainment" and of Miss Bow said: "This is the most acceptable bit of talkie acting Miss Bow has done." However, they noted, "Miss Bow is presented in her dancing duds as often as possible, and her dancing duds wouldn't weigh two pounds soaking wet." Bow commented on her revealing costume in Hoop-La: "Rex accused me of enjoying showing myself off. Then I got a little sore. He knew darn well I was doing it because we could use a little money these days. Who can't?" Bow reflected on her career: Bow and actor Rex Bell (later a Lieutenant governor of Nevada) had two sons, Tony Beldam (born 1934, changed name to Rex Anthony Bell, Jr., died July 8, 2011) and George Beldam, Jr. (born 1938). Bow retired from acting in 1933. In September 1937, Bell and she opened The 'It' Cafe on Vine Street near Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. It was closed shortly thereafter.Stenn (1988), p. 250 Her last public exposure, albeit fleeting, came in 1947 on the radio show Truth or Consequences. Bow was the mystery voice in the show's "Mrs. Hush" contest. Bow eventually began showing symptoms of psychiatric illness. She became socially withdrawn, and although she refused to socialize with her husband, she also refused to let him leave the house alone. In 1944, while Bell was running for the U.S. House of Representatives, Bow tried to commit suicide. A note was found in which Bow stated she preferred death to a public life.Stenn (1988), p. 256 In 1949, she checked in to the Institute of Living to be treated for her chronic insomnia and diffuse abdominal pains. Shock treatment was tried and numerous psychological tests performed. Bow's IQ was measured "bright normal", while others claimed she was unable to reason, had poor judgment and displayed inappropriate or even bizarre behavior. Her pains were considered delusional and she was diagnosed with schizophrenia; however, she experienced neither auditory nor visual hallucinations. Analysts tied the onset of the illness, as well as her insomnia, to the "butcher knife episode" back in 1922, but Bow rejected psychological explanations and left the Institute.Stenn (19888) pp. 263, 266Morella and Epstein (1976), p. 276 Bow did not return to her family. After leaving the institution, Bow lived alone in a bungalow, which she rarely left, until her death. Bow spent her last years in Culver City, Los Angeles, under the constant care of a nurse, living off an estate worth about $500,000 at the time of her death. She died of a heart attack on September 27, 1965, at the age of 60. An autopsy revealed that she suffered from atherosclerosis, a disease of the heart that can begin in early adolescence.De Vane, Mattew S. Heart Smart, John Wiley and Sons, 2006. pp. 31–32 Bow's heart showed scarring from an earlier undetected heart attack.Stenn (1988) p. 281 She was interred in the Freedom Mausoleum, Sanctuary of Heritage at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Her pallbearers were Harry Richman, Richard Arlen, Jack Oakie, Maxie Rosenbloom, Jack Dempsey, and Buddy Rogers.Morella and Epstein (1976), p. 283 In 1999, film historian Leonard Maltin said, "You think of Greta Garbo, Lillian Gish, all these great names, great actresses, Clara Bow was more popular in terms of box-office dollars, in terms of consistently bringing audiences into the theaters, she was right on top."Leonard Maltin interviewed in Turner Classic Documentary "Discovering the It Girl", Timeline Films, 1999. In 1999, the American Film Institute left Bow outside its final "100 Years...100 Stars" list,American Film Institute"100 Years...100 Stars" although she was on the list of nominees.American Film Institute "100 Years...100 Stars Nominees" Film historian Kevin Brownlow did not mention Bow in his book on silent films, The Parade's Gone By (1968). Louise Brooks, who rated an entire chapter in the book, wrote to Brownlow, "You brush off Clara Bow for some old nothing like Brooks. Clara made three pictures that will never be surpassed: Dancing Mothers, Mantrap, and It."Letter from Louise Brooks to Kevin Brownlow, October 26, 1968. Brownlow made up for this omission by including an entire segment about Bow in his television documentary Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film (1980), for which he interviewed Brooks. During her lifetime, Bow was the subject of wild rumors regarding her sex life; most of them were untrue. A tabloid called The Coast Reporter published lurid allegations about her in 1931, accusing her of exhibitionism, incest, lesbianism, bestiality, drug addiction, alcoholism, and having contracted a venereal disease. The publisher of the tabloid then tried to blackmail Bow, offering to cease printing the stories for $25,000, which led to his arrest by federal agents and, later, an eight-year prison sentence.Stenn (1988) p. 238 Fictional portrayals Explanatory notes  Citations  Bibliography "Miss Bow will undoubtedly gain fame as a screen comedienne".Ogden Standard Examiner, December 17, 1922 (Pre-release) "She scored a tremendous hit in Down to the Sea in Ships..(and).. has reached the front rank of motion picture principal players".Pennsylvania Daily News, September 4, 1923 "With her beauty, her brains, her personality and her genuine acting ability it should not be many moons before she enjoys stardom in the fullest sense of the word.

For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Bow was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1994, she was honored with an image on a United States postage stamp designed by caricaturist Al Hirschfeld. Max Fleischer's cartoon character Betty Boop was modeled after Bow and entertainer Helen Kane (the "boop-boop-a-doop-girl"). Bow's mass of tangled red hair was one of her most famous features. When fans of the new star found out she put henna in her hair, sales of the dye tripled.TCM Film Guide, 31 An autographed picture of Bow is offered as a consolation prize of a beauty contest in the 1931 George Gershwin musical Of Thee I Sing. The lead character of Peppy Miller from the 2011 film The Artist was inspired principally by Clara Bow, and in playing the part, actress Bérénice Bejo invoked many of Bow's screen mannerisms.Lopez, Annemarie. "Berenice Bejo's silent movie role gets Oscar pundits talking" The Week (January 3, 2012) Bow is also mentioned in Prince's song "Condition of the Heart" from his 1985 Around the World in a Day album.

In the musical Bonnie and Clyde, Clara is referenced several times in the show as someone Bonnie Parker wants to be like, such as the entire song "Picture Show", and Clyde mentions her again in "This World Will Remember Us". In the 1972 film Cabaret, singer Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) strikes a pose that, she insists, is "early Clara Bow." In the TV show Bones, Temperance Brennan attributes her accent and behavior as her undercover persona "Roxanne" to how she imagined Clara Bow sounded during her childhood.
