     Kathmandu(; Nepali pronunciation: ) is the capital and largest municipality of Nepal. It also hosts the headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It is the only city of Nepal with the administrative status of Mahanagar (Metropolitan City), as compared to Upa-Mahanagar (Sub-Metropolitan City) or Nagar (City). Kathmandu is the core of Nepal's largest urban agglomeration located in the Kathmandu Valley consisting of Lalitpur, Kirtipur, Madhyapur Thimi, Bhaktapur and a number of smaller communities. Kathmandu is also known informally as "KTM" or the "tri-city". According to the 2011 census, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has a population of 975,453 and measures . The city stands at an elevation of approximately  in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley of central Nepal. It is surrounded by four major hills: Shivapuri, Phulchoki, Nagarjun, and Chandragiri. Kathmandu Valley is part of three districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur), has the highest population density in the country, and is home to about a twelfth of Nepal's population. Historically, the Kathmandu Valley and adjoining areas were known as Nepal Mandala. Until the 15th century, Bhaktapur was its capital when two other capitals, Kathmandu and Lalitpur, were established.Slusser, Mary (1982). Nepal Mandala: A Cultural Study of the Kathmandu Valley. Princeton University. ISBN 978-0-691-03128-6. Page vii. During the Rana and Shah eras, British historians called the valley itself "Nepal Proper". Today, Kathmandu is not only the capital of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, but also the headquarters of the Bagmati Zone and the Central Development Region of Nepal. Kathmandu is the gateway to tourism in Nepal. It is also the hub of the country's economy. It has the most advanced infrastructure of any urban area in Nepal, and its economy is focused on tourism, which accounted for 3.8% of Nepal's GDP in 1995/96. Tourism in Kathmandu declined thereafter during a period of political unrest, but since then has improved. In 2013, Kathmandu was ranked third among the top 10 travel destinations on the rise in the world by TripAdvisor, and ranked first in Asia.http://www.businessinsider.com/tripadvisor-says-these-are-the-hot-new-destinations-for-travelers-2013-12 The city has a rich history, spanning nearly 2000 years, as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. Most of Kathmandu's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism. There are people of other religious beliefs as well, giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture. Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city. English is understood by Kathmandu's educated residents. Historic areas of Kathmandu were devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April 2015.  The city of Kathmandu is named after Kasthamandap temple, that stood in Durbar Square. In Sanskrit, Kastha () means "wood" and Mandap () means "covered shelter". This temple, also known as Maru Satal (in ″Newar language″), was built in 1596 by King Laxmi Narsingh Malla. The two-storey structure was made entirely of wood, and used no iron nails nor supports. According to legend, all the timber used to build the pagoda was obtained from a single tree. The structure collapsed during the major earthquake on 25 April 2015. The colophons of ancient manuscripts, dated as late as the 20th century, refer to Kathmandu as Kasthamandap Mahanagar in Nepal Mandala.  Mahanagar means "great city". The city is called "Kasthamandap" in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day. Thus, Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap.  During medieval times, the city was sometimes called Kantipur (कान्तिपुर). This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur. "Kanti" is one of the names of the Goddess Lakshmi, and "pur" means place. Among the indigenous Newar people, Kathmandu is known as Yen Desa (येँ देश), and Patan and Bhaktapur are known as Yala Desa (यल देश) and Khwopa Desa (ख्वप देश). pp. 159, 162-163. "Yen" is the shorter form of Yambu (यम्बु), which originally referred to the northern half of Kathmandu.   Archaeological excavations in parts of Kathmandu have found evidence of ancient civilizations. The oldest of these findings is a statue, found in Maligaon, that was dated at 185 AD. The excavation of Dhando Chaitya uncovered a brick with an inscription in Brahmi script. Archaeologists believe it is two thousand years old. Stone inscriptions are an ubiquitous element at heritage sites and are key sources for the history of Nepal The earliest Western reference to Kathmandu appears in an account of Jesuit Fathers Johann Grueber and Albert d'Orville. In 1661, they passed through Nepal on their way from Tibet to India, and reported that they reached "Cadmendu, the capital of the Kingdom of Necbal". The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional myths and legends. According to Swayambhu Purana, present-day Kathmandu was once a huge and deep lake. The lake was cut drained by bodhisatwa Manjusri  with his sword and the water was evacuated out from there and he established a city called Manjupattan and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land.<ref name=prehistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=4&pr_id=4|title=History|accessdate=2009-12-12|publisher=Government of Nepal}}</ref><ref name=travel>{{cite web|url=http://www.newatravels.com/nepal/index.html|title=History:Ancient Nepal|accessdate=2009-12-18|publisher=New Travels and Tours Ltd}}</ref><ref name="nepalmandal.com">{{cite web|last=Apr |first=Wed |url=http://www.nepalmandal.com/content/7752.html |title=Article:झीसं पत्याः यानाच्वनागु अन्धविश्वास – Author:विपेन्द्र महर्जन Nepalmandal |publisher=Nepalmandal.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref>  Kotirudra Samhita of [[Shiva Purana]], Chapter 11, shloka 18 refers to the place as Nayapala city famous for its Pashupati Shivalinga. The name Nepal probably originates from this city Nayapala.  Very few historical records exist of the period before the medieval [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavis]] rulers. According to [[Gopalraj Vansawali]], a genealogy of Nepali monarchs, the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were [[Pala empire|Gopalas]], Mahispalas, Aabhirs, [[Kirati people|Kirants]], and Somavanshi.<ref name="nepalmandal.com"/><ref>Article:गोपालराज वंशावली Language: Nepalbhasa, Journal:नेपालभाषा केन्द्रीय विभागया जर्नल, Edition:1, Date: 1998, Page: 18-25, 44</ref> The Kirata dynasty was established by [[Yalamber]]. During the Kirata era, a settlement called [[Yambu (Nepal)|Yambu]] existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu. In some of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], Kathmandu is still called Yambu. Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu, near Manjupattan. During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler, Jitedasti, Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at [[Sankhu]].  ===Medieval history=== [[File:Nepaul valley map 1802.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Kathmandu, 1802]]  ====Licchavi era==== The Licchavis from the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]] migrated north and defeated the Kiratas, establishing the Licchavi dynasty. During this era, following the genocide of [[Shakya]]s in [[Lumbini]] by [[Virudhaka (raja)|Virudhaka]], the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery in Sankhu masquerading as Koliyas. From Sankhu, they migrated to Yambu and Yengal (Lanjagwal and Manjupattan) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu. This created the basis of [[Newar Buddhism]], which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based Buddhist tradition in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsbcproject.org/manuscripts/short-history |title=A Short History of Sanskrit Buddhist Manuscripts |publisher=Dsbcproject.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref> With their migration, Yambu was called Koligram and Yengal was called Dakshin Koligram<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/Page_Ward+No.+23_38 |title=Kathmandu Metropolitan City |publisher=Kathmandu.gov.np |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref> during most of the Licchavi era.<ref name="काष्ठमण्डप कि होममण्डप">{{cite web|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=37878&cat_id=22 |title=काष्ठमण्डप कि होममण्डप |publisher=Gorkhapatra.org.np |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>  Eventually, the Licchavi ruler [[Gunakamadeva]] merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram, founding the city of Kathmandu.<ref name="काष्ठमण्डप कि होममण्डप"/> The city was designed in the shape of ''Chandrahrasa'', the sword of Manjushri. The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by [[Ajima]]s. One of these barracks is still in use at [[Bhadrakali, Nepal|Bhadrakali]] (in front of [[Singha Durbar]]). The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet, leading to tremendous growth in architecture. Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha, Kailaskut Bhawan, and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travelers and monks who lived during this era. For example, the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] described Kailaskut Bhawan, the palace of the Licchavi king [[Amshuverma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/kantipur/news/news-detail.php?news_id=224549 |title=राष्ट्रपति अचानक ग्यालरीमा &#124; कला र शैली &#124; :: कान्तिपुर :: |publisher=Ekantipur.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref> The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well. The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era, both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas. Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia, creating religious art for their neighbors. For example, [[Araniko]] led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China. [[Bhrikuti]], the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch [[Songtsän Gampo]], was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet.  ====Malla era==== [[File:Kathmandu Darbar0659.JPG|right|thumb|Taleju Bhawani Temple, the temple of the Malla clan's deity.]] The Licchavi era was followed by the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla era]]. Rulers from [[Tirhut]], upon being attacked by [[Muslim]]s, fled north to the Kathmandu valley. They intermarried with Nepali royalty, and this led to the Malla era. The early years of the Malla era were turbulent, with raids and attacks from [[Khas]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] Muslims. There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu's population, including the king [[Abhaya Malla]]. These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era (such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan), and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city. Despite the initial hardships, Kathmandu rose to prominence again and, during most of the Malla era, dominated the trade between India and Tibet. Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade.  During the later part of the Malla era, Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities: Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur. These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal. These states competed with each other in the arts, architecture, aesthetics, and trade, resulting in tremendous development. The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings, squares, and temples, as well as the development of water spouts, the institutionalization of trusts (called [[guthi]]s), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas, and the performance of plays in city squares. Evidence of an influx of ideas from India, Tibet, China, Persia, and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king [[Pratap Malla]]. Books have been found from this era that describe their [[Tantra|tantric]] tradition (e.g. Tantrakhyan), medicine (e.g.&nbsp;Haramekhala), religion (e.g.&nbsp;Mooldevshashidev), law, morals, and history. Amarkosh, a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD, was also found. Architecturally notable buildings from this era include [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]], [[Patan Durbar Square]], [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square]], the former durbar of [[Kirtipur]], [[Nyatapola]], Kumbheshwar, the Krishna temple, and others.  ===Modern era=== [[File:Garden of Dream Nepal2.jpg|right|thumb|Garden of Dreams, a Western styled garden built during the modern era]]  ====Early Shah rule==== The [[Gorkha Kingdom]] ended the Malla confederation after the [[Battle of Kathmandu]] in 1768. This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu. The [[Battle of Kirtipur]] was the start of the [[History of Kathmandu#1769-1845|Gorkha conquest]] of the Kathmandu Valley. Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire, and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal. During the early part of this era, Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture. Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture, such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur, were built during this era. However, trade declined because of continual war with neighboring nations. [[Bhimsen Thapa]] supported France against Great Britain; this led to the development of modern military structures, such as modern barracks in Kathmandu. The nine-storey tower [[Dharahara]] was originally built during this era.  ====Rana rule==== Rana rule over Nepal started with the [[Kot Massacre]], which occurred near Hanuman Dhoka Durbar. During this massacre, most of Nepal's high-ranking officials were massacred by [[Jang Bahadur Rana]] and his supporters. Another massacre, the [[List of massacres in Nepal|Bhandarkhal Massacre]], was also conducted by Kunwar and his supporters in Kathmandu. During the Rana regime, Kathmandu's alliance shifted from anti-British to pro-British; this led to the construction of the first buildings in the style of Western European architecture. The most well-known of these buildings include [[Singha Durbar]], [[Garden of Dreams]], Shital Niwas, and the old Narayanhiti palace. The first modern commercial road in the Kathmandu Valley, the [[New Road of Kathmandu|New Road]], was also built during this era. Trichandra College (the first college of Nepal), Durbar School (the first modern school of Nepal), and Bir Hospital (the first hospital of Nepal) were built in Kathmandu during this era. Rana rule was marked by despotism, economic exploitation and religious persecution.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Angela|title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last= Lal |first=C.

The average elevation is {{convert|1400|m|ft|sigfig=2}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].<ref name="KTM intro"/> The city is directly bounded by several other municipalities of the Kathmandu valley: south of the Bagmati by [[Patan, Lalitpur|Lalitpur]] Sub-Metropolitan City (Patan) with which it today forms one urban area surrounded by a ring road, to the southwest by [[Kirtipur|Kirtipur Municipality]] and to the east by [[Madhyapur Thimi|Madyapur Thimi Municipality]]. To the north the urban area extends into several [[Village Development Committees]]. However, the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighboring municipalities, e. g. to Bhaktapur and just about covers the entire Kathmandu valley.  Kathmandu is dissected by eight rivers, the main river of the valley, the [[Bagmati River|Bagmati]] and its tributaries, of which the [[Bisnumati River|Bishnumati]], Dhobi Khola, Manohara Khola, Hanumant Khola, and Tukucha Khola are predominant.

The urban area of the Kathmandu valley is split among three different districts (collections of local government units within a [[Zones of Nepal|zone]]) which extend [http://www.citypopulation.de/php/nepal-kathmanduvalley.php very little beyond the valley fringe, except towards the southern ranges, which have comparatively small population].  They have the three highest population densities in the country.  Within the districts lie VDCs (villages), 3 municipalities ([[Bhaktapur]], [[Kirtipur]], [[Madhyapur Thimi]]), 1 sub-metropolitan city ([[Lalitpur, Nepal|Lalitpur]]), and 1 metropolitan city (Kathmandu).  Some district subdivisions remain legally ''villages'' yet are densely populated, [[Gonggabu]] VDC notably recorded a density over 20,000 people/km<sup>2</sup>. (2011 census).

The city is located in an ancient lake basin, with fertile soil and flat terrain. This geography helped form a society based on agriculture. This, combined with its location between India and China, helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading center over the centuries. Kathmandu's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the [[Silk Road]] which linked India and Tibet.

This industry started around 1950, as the country's political makeup changed and ended the country's isolation from the rest of the world. In 1956, air transportation was established and the Tribhuvan Highway, between Kathmandu and [[Raxaul]] (at India's border), was started. Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote this activity; some of these include the Tourism Development Board, the Department of Tourism and the Civil Aviation Department. Furthermore, Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations. Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity. The hotel industry, travel agencies, training of tourist guides, and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the remarkable growth of this industry in Nepal, and in Kathmandu in particular.<ref name="Shrestha p.86-89">Shrestha pp.86–89</ref>  Since then, tourism in Nepal has thrived; it is the country's most important industry.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city, with several hundred thousand visitors annually. Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu's religious sites such as [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]], [[Swayambhunath]], [[Boudhanath]] and [[Budhanilkantha]]. From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62, the number jumped to 491,504 in 1999/2000. Following the end of the Maoist insurgency, there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009. Since then, tourism has improved as the country turned into a Democratic Republic. In economic terms, the foreign exchange registered 3.8% of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining{{why|date=March 2013}}. The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country.<ref name="Shrestha p.86-89"/>  The neighbourhood of [[Thamel]] is Kathmandu's primary "traveller's ghetto", packed with guest houses, restaurants, shops, and bookstores, catering to tourists.

There are three preserved Durbar Squares in Kathmandu valley and one unpreserved in [[Kirtipur]]. The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is located in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms (Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kirtipur); the earliest is the Licchavi dynasty. The complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the Durbar Square. The outer quadrangle has the [[Kasthamandap]], [[Kumari (children)|Kumari Ghar]], and Shiva-Parvati Temple; the inner quadrangle has the [[Hanuman Dhoka|Hanuman Dhoka palace]]. The squares were severely damaged in the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]].  Hanuman Dhoka is a complex of structures with the Royal Palace of the Malla kings and of the Shah dynasty. It is spread over five acres. The eastern wing, with ten courtyards, is the oldest part, dating to the mid-16th century. It was expanded by King Pratap Malla in the 17th century with many temples. The royal family lived in this palace until 1886 when they moved to Narayanhiti Palace.

Kumari, or Kumari Devi, is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or ''devi'' in South Asian countries. In Nepal the selection process is very rigorous. Kumari is believed to be the bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju (the Nepali name for Durga) until she menstruates, after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury are also causes for her to revert to common status. The current Royal Kumari, Matina Shakya, age four, was installed in October 2008 by the Maoist government that replaced the monarchy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitnepal.com/nepal_information/kumari.php |title= Kumari Devi&nbsp;– The Living Goddess|publisher=Visitnepal.com|accessdate=2009-12-19}}</ref>  [[Kasthamandap]] is a three-storeyed temple enshrining an image of [[Gorakhnath]].

From the 3rd century BC, apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses, Buddhist monuments from the [[Ashoka]]n period (it is said that [[Emperor Ashoka|Ashoka]] visited Nepal in 250&nbsp;BC) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular. These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution: the Licchavi or classical period (500 to 900&nbsp;AD), the post-classical period (1000 to 1400&nbsp;AD), with strong influence of the Palla art form; the Malla period (1400 onwards) that exhibited explicitly [[tantra|tantric]] influences coupled with the art of [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan]] [[Demonology]].<ref name="Jha p.23">Jha p.23</ref>  A broad typology has been ascribed to the decorative designs and carvings created by the people of Nepal.

Narayanhity was a new palace, in front of the old palace built in 1915, and was built in 1970 in the form of a contemporary [[Pagoda]]. It was built on the occasion of the marriage of [[King Birendra|King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah]], then heir apparent to the throne.

[[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]] in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts. Art in Kathmandu is vibrant, demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art, derived from a great number of national, Asian, and global influences. Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas: the idealistic traditional painting known as [[Paubha]]s in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as [[Thangka]]s in Tibet, closely linked to the country's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting, including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for.<ref name="Museums"/> Internationally, the British-based charity, the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kathmanduarts.org/ |title=Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre |publisher=Kathmanduarts.org |accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref>  Kathmandu contains many notable art galleries.

Kathmandu also houses some international standard cinema theatres and multiplexes, such as QFX Cinemas, Cine De Chef, Fcube Cinemas, Q's Cinemas and Big Movies.  ====Music==== [[File:Gunla bajan performance.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Buddhist musical performance during [[Gunla]].]] Kathmandu is the centre of music and dance in Nepal, and these art forms are integral to understanding the city. Musical performances are organized in cultural venues. Music is a part of the traditional aspect of Kathmandu. [[Gunla]] is the traditional music festival according to [[Nepal Sambat]]. Newar music originated in Kathmandu. Furthermore, music from all over Nepal can be found in Kathmandu.  A number of [[hippie]]s visited Kathmandu during the 1970s and introduced [[Rock and Roll|rock and roll]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[jazz]] to the city. Kathmandu is noted internationally for its [[jazz]] festival, popularly known as [[Jazzmandu]]. It is the only jazz festival in the Himalayan region and was established in March 2002. The festival attracts musicians from countries worldwide, such as [[Australia]], [[Denmark]], [[United States]], [[Benin]], and [[India]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  The city has been referenced in numerous songs, including works by [[Cat Stevens]] ('Katmandu', ''[[Mona Bone Jakon]]'' (1970)), [[Bob Seger]] ('Katmandu', ''[[Beautiful Loser]]'' (1975)), [[Rush (band)|Rush]] ('[[A Passage to Bangkok]]', ''Pulling into Kathmandu''; ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'', 1976), [[Krematorij]] ('Kathmandu', ''Three Springs'' (2000)) and [[Fito Páez]] (''Tráfico por Katmandú''&nbsp;– "Traffic through Kathmandu").  ===Cuisine=== [[File:Dalbath.jpg|right|thumb|A typical Nepali meal [[Dal bhat]] in Kathmandu]]  The staple food of most people in Kathmandu is [[dal bhat]]. This consists of rice and lentil soup, generally served with vegetable curries, achar and sometimes Chutney. [[Momo (food)|Momo]], a type of Nepali version of Tibetan dumpling, has become prominent in Nepal with many street vendors selling it. It is one of the most popular fast foods in Kathmandu. Various Nepali variants of momo including buff (i.e. buffalo) momo, chicken momo, and vegetarian momo are famous in Kathmandu.    Most of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian. However, the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon, and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city. Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places. ''Buff'' (meat of water buffalo) is very common. There is a strong tradition of ''buff'' consumption in Kathmandu, especially among [[Newar]]s, which is not found in other parts of Nepal. Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago. Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal, pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes. A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo. The Muslims forbid eating ''buff'' as from [[Quran]] while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow's meat as the consider Cow to be a goddess and symbol of purity. The chief breakfast for locals and visitors is mostly ''Momo'' or ''Chowmein''.  Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955.<ref name="LP 2003, p.91">Lonely Planet (2003), pp. 91–92</ref> A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened, catering [[Nepali cuisine]], [[Tibetan cuisine]], [[Chinese cuisine]] and [[Indian cuisine]] in particular. Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals, expatriates, and tourists. The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American [[chop suey]], which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a [[fried egg]] commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine.<ref name="LP 2003, p.91"/> Continental cuisine can be found in selected places. International chain restaurants are rare, but some outlets of [[Pizza Hut]] and [[KFC]] have recently opened there.

Tea is widely served but is extremely weak by western standards. It is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk, sugar and spices. Alcohol is widely drunk, and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages. Drinking and driving is illegal, and authorities have a zero tolerance policy.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21559665|title=Nepal: A whiff of sobriety |publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=July 28, 2012|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref> [[Ailaa]] and [[thwon]] (alcohol made from rice) are the alcoholic beverages of Kathmandu, found in all the local [[Bhatti (Nepal)|bhattis]] (alcohol serving eateries).

Traditionally, these festivals were celebrated by Newars. In recent years, these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well. As the capital of the Republic of Nepal, various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu. With mass migration to the city, the cultures of Khas from the west, Kirats from the east, Bon/Tibetan from the north, and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously. The festivities such as the Ghode (horse) Jatra, [[Indra Jatra]], Dashain [[Durga Puja]] festivals, [[Shivratri]] and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm. Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporate Hindu traditions and ethics. These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings, as devout Hindus and protectors of Buddhist religion.  Cultural continuity has been maintained for centuries in the exclusive worship of goddesses and deities in Kathmandu and the rest of the country. These deities include the [[Ajima]], Taleju (or Tulja Bhavani), Digu taleju, and Kumari (the living goddess).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The artistic edifices have now become places of worship in the everyday life of the people, therefore a roster is maintained to observe annual festivals. There are 133 festivals held in the year.<ref name=heritage>{{cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=137&pr_id=167|title=Katmandu as a world Heritage Site|publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref>  Some of the traditional festivals observed in Kathmandu, apart from those previously mentioned, are Bada Dashain, Tihar, Chhath, Maghe Sankranti, Naga Panchami, Janai Poornima, Pancha Dan, Teej/Rishi Panchami, [[Pahan Charhe]], [[Jana Baha Dyah Jatra]] (White Machchhendranath Jatra), and Matatirtha Aunsi.<ref name=festival/>  ===Hinduism=== [[File:Dakshinkali0900.JPG|thumb|right|Dakshinkali temple]] Assumedly, together with the kingdom of Licchhavi (c. 400 to 750), Hinduism and the [[endogamy|endogam]] [[social stratification]] of the [[Caste]] was established in Kathmandu Valley. The [[Pashupatinath Temple]], [[Changu Narayan]] temple (the oldest), and the [[Kasthamandap]] are of particular importance to Hindus. Other notable Hindu temples in Kathmandu and the surrounding valley include [[Bajrayogini Temple]], [[Dakshinkali Temple]], [[Guhyeshwari Temple]], and the [[Sobha Bhagwati]] shrine.  The [[Bagmati]] River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists, and many Hindu temples are located on the banks of this river. The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks, and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side. According to the Nepali Hindu tradition, the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation. The chief mourner (usually the first son) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation. Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually.  ===Buddhism=== {{Main|Buddhism in Nepal}} Buddhism started in Kathmandu with the arrival of Buddhist monks during the time of Buddha (c. 563 - 483 BC<ref name=Cousins>L. S. Cousins (1996), "[http://indology.info/papers/cousins The dating of the historical Buddha]: a review article", ''[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]]'' '''(3)6(1)''': 57–63.</ref>). They started a forest monastery in [[Sankhu]]. This monastery was renovated by [[Shakya]]s after they fled genocide from [[Virudhaka (raja)|Virudhaka]] (rule: 491-461 BC).  During the Hindu Lichchavi era (c. 400 to 750), various monasteries and orders were created which successively led to the formation of [[Newar Buddhism]], which is still practiced in the primary [[liturgical language]] of Hinduism, [[Sanskrit]].  Legendary Princess [[Bhrikuti]] (7th-century) and artist [[Araniko]] (1245 - 1306 AD) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China. There are over 108 traditional monasteries (Bahals and Bahis) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism. Since the 1960s, the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area. Also, with the modernization of Newar Buddhism, various Theravada Bihars have been established.  ===Kirant Mundhum=== {{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}} Kirant Mundhum is one of the indigenous [[animism|animistic]] practices of Nepal. It is practiced by [[Kirat]] people. Some animistic aspects of Kirant beliefs, such as ancestor worship (worship of Ajima) are also found in Newars of Kirant origin. Ancient religious sites believed to be worshipped by ancient Kirats, such as Pashupatinath, Wanga Akash Bhairabh (Yalambar) and Ajima are now worshipped by people of all Dharmic religions in Kathmandu. Kirats who have migrated from other parts of Nepal to Kathmandu practice [[Mundhum]] in the city.  ===Others=== [[Sikhism]] is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole. An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct. [[Jainism in Nepal|Jainism]] is practiced by a small community. A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar, where Jains practice their faith. According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'is]] of Nepal, there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley. They have a National Office located in Shantinagar, Baneshwor. The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu. Islam is practised in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority, accounting for about 4.2% of the population of Nepal.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches. Christian missionary hospitals, welfare organizations, and schools are also operating. Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies, who had converted to Christianity while in service, on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion. They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu, in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://across.co.nz/NepalChurches.html|title=Churches in Nepal|publisher= Across.co.nz|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref><ref name =Christ>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35518.htm|title=US Department of State: Diplomacy in Action|accessdate=December 20, 2009|publisher=[[US Department of State]]}}</ref>  ==Education== [[File:TU building.jpg|thumb|left|Tribhuwan University, the oldest university of Nepal]] The oldest modern school in Nepal is [[Durbar School]], and the oldest college, [[Tri Chandra College]], are both located in Kathmandu city.
