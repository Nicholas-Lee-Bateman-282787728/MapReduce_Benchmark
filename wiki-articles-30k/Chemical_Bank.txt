   Chemical Bank was a bank with headquarters in New York City from 1824 until 1996.  The bank operated as the primary subsidiary of the Chemical Banking Corporation, a bank holding company established in 1988.  At the end of 1995, Chemical was the third largest bank in the U.S. with approximately $182.9 billion in assets.Chemical Banking Corp. SEC Form 10-K Annual Report for the Year Ended December 31, 1995 Beginning in 1920 but accelerating in the 1980s and 1990s, Chemical was a leading consolidator of the banking industry in the United States, acquiring Chase Manhattan Bank, Manufacturers Hanover, Texas Commerce Bank and Corn Exchange Bank among others.  Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase, the bank adopted the venerable Chase brand.  What had been Chemical Bank is now a foundational component of what today is JPMorgan Chase. Chemical Bank was headquartered in New York City with more than 39,000 employees globally as of the end of 1995. Chemical Bank was the principal operating subsidiary of the Chemical Banking Corporation, a bank holding company.  As of the end of 1995, prior to its merger with the Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical was the third largest bank in the United States in terms of total assets with $182.9 billion of assets.  The Chemical Banking Corporation was the fifth largest bank holding company in terms of total assets. Of Chemical's $182.9 billion of total assets, the bank held approximately $82.1 billion of loans, representing a balance between mortgage loans and other consumer loans as well as commercial loans in the U.S. and internationally.  Among Chemical's largest international exposure was to Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. The other assets on the bank's balance sheet included cash as well as various debt and equity securities. Chemical reported record net income of $1.8 billion for 1995.  Chemical's level of capital at the end of 1995 remained strong, with capital adequacy ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements. The Corporation's Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 8.5% and 12.1%, respectively. Chemical was one of the leading banks in the U.S., active both in corporate banking as well as retail banking.  Within retail banking, Chemical provided personal and commercial checking accounts, savings and time deposit accounts, personal loans, consumer financing and mortgage banking as well as trust and estate administration. Chemical's corporate banking business provided a wide variety business loans, leasing, real estate financing, money transfer and cash management among other services.  Chemical was among the leading bank lenders to small and medium-sized businesses.  Chemical also had a significant presence in investment banking as well as underwriting corporate debt and equity securities. Prior to its merger with Chase, Chemical was structured into two operating segments: the Global Bank and Consumer & Relationship Banking. The bank opened its first offices at 216 Broadway in Downtown New York in 1824 at the corner of Ann Street.  In 1848 the bank agreed to sell its building to its neighbor Barnum's American Museum (the building collapsed during Barnum's subsequent remodeling) and in 1850 the bank moved into its newly constructed headquarters at 270 Broadway.Plan $2,500,000 Building at Broadway and Chambers – New York Times – September 21, 1928  Chemical bought additional land adjacent its 270 Broadway building in 1879 and 1887 but its offices remained modest through the start of the 20th century. In 1907 the bank constructed a new headquarters on the original and adjacent properties at 270 Broadway.  In 1921, Chemical acquired a 13-Story building belonging to the Shoe & Leather Bank on Broadway, next door to and surrounded by its existing properties.Chemical Buys Broadway Corner. New York Times, January 29, 1921  Despite expanding its 1907 headquarters over the years, by the mid-1920s Chemical was in need of additional space to accommodate its growth and reflect its increasing profile. In 1926, the bank made plans to move again, this time constructing a new six story location at 165 Broadway, on the corner of Broadway and Cortlandt Street, closer to the Financial District.  Chemical moved into its new headquarters in 1928, after completion of the building, and the bank's headquarters would remain at that location for more than five decades. Under Chairman Donald Platten, Chemical's headquarters was to move to 277 Park Avenue in 1979.Donald C. Platten, Ex-Chairman Of Chemical Bank, Is Dead at 72.  New York Times, August 27, 1991Chemical Bank Selling Building.  New York Times, April 10, 1981  The bank moved across Park Avenue in 1991 to occupy the former headquarters of Manufacturers Hanover Corporation at 270 Park Avenue, which is still the headquarters of Chemical's successor, JPMorgan Chase.  However, JPMorgan Chase returned to 277 Park Avenue in 2000, following the departure of its previous tenant, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.  In 2008, following JPMorgan's acquisition of Bear Stearns, the bank relocated its investment banking groups from Chemical's old headquarters to 383 Madison Avenue.Bank crisis puts New York office market on precipice.  New York Times, March 26, 2008  The company was founded in 1823 as the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company by Balthazar P. Melick together with the original directors of the company, John C. Morrison, Mark Spenser, Gerardus Post, James Jenkins, William A. Seely and William Stebbins.History of the Chemical Bank 1823–1913.  Privately Published by The Chemical National Bank, 1913  Additionally, Joseph Sampson, although not a director was among the largest of the original shareholders of the bank.  The founders used the manufacturing company, which produced chemicals such as blue vitriol, alum, nitric acid, camphor and saltpeter, as well as medicines, paints, and dyes as a means to securing a bank charter from the New York State legislature.scripophily.net – Retrieved November 8, 2007  During the 1820s, prospective bankers found that they were more likely to be able to successfully secure a charter if the bank were part of a larger business.  The following year, in April 1824, the company successfully amended its charter to allow Chemical to begin its banking practice.  As a result, Chemical Bank was originally a division of the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company.  Balthazar Melick was named the first president of the bank, which catered to merchants in New York City.Chemical National Bank of New York to Pay Interest on Deposits.  Bankers Magazine, Volume 94, 1917 John Mason became a shareholder of the bank in 1826 and would serve as Chemical's second president.  Mason, who would later be referred to as "the father of the Chemical Bank," and was one of the richest merchants of his day in New York, succeeded Baltus Melick in 1831.  Mason was responsible for establishing the highly conservative business culture of the young bank that would persist for nearly 90 years.  For its first twenty-five years, the bank paid no dividends, nor did it pay interest on its customers' deposits.  Mason was also responsible for leading Chemical through the Panic of 1837.  When a speculative bubble collapsed on May 10, 1837, banks suspended payment of gold and silver.  Although twenty years later, Chemical would stand alone and continue to make payments in specie, in this crisis the bank followed others in suspending payments.  Chemical was one of the earliest to resume payments in specie. Mason died on September 26, 1839, but his legacy of conservatism was taken on by his successors.  Isaac Jones and later his cousin John Quentin Jones would lead Chemical, both serving as president, across the next forty years through 1878.  Both Isaac and John Jones had close connections to John Mason, particularly Isaac who married one of John Mason's three daughters.  The Mason and Jones families would maintain effective control of Chemical for much of its first five decades.Around Washington Square: an illustrated history of Greenwich Village. JHU Press, 2003  John Q. Jones was succeeded in 1878 by George G.

The World's Work,  Volume 3, 1901–1902, p. 2005-2008  In that position, Williams was also inculcated in Chemical's conservative style of banking.  Williams would serve as president from 1878 through 1903. In 1844, when New York Chemical Manufacturing Company's original charter expired, the chemical company was liquidated and was reincorporated as a bank only, becoming the Chemical Bank of New York in 1844.  Among the bank's first directors under its new charter were Cornelius Roosevelt, John D. Wolfe, Isaac Platt and Bradish Johnson, as well as the bank's president John Q. Jones.  The company sold all remaining inventories from the chemical division as well as real estate holdings by 1851. Two years later, in 1853, Chemical became a charter member of the New York Clearing House, the first and largest bank clearing house in the U.S.  Two Chemical presidents would also serve as head of the clearing house, with John Q. Jones serving from 1865–1871 and George G. Williams serving in 1886 and from 1893–1894.Clearing house of New York city: New York clearing house association, 1854–1905.  1904 During the Panic of 1857, Chemical Bank earned the nickname "Old Bullion" by taking a stand that it would continue to redeem its bank notes in specie throughout the crisis.  The panic, which had hit banks and caused a number of failures, led banks across the country to suspend specie payments and turn to issuing paper promissory notes.Business & Finance: Old Bullion's Team.  Time Magazine, Jan. 28, 1935BANK 100 YEARS OLD TODAY.; Chemical National, Known as "Old Bullion," Celebrates. New York Times, July 30, 1924  Chemical's decision was highly unpopular among its fellow banks and led to the bank's temporary suspension from the New York Clearing House, of which Chemical was a charter member.Markham, Jerry. A financial history of the United States.  Volume I: From Christopher Columbus through the Robber Barrons. 2002  While hundreds of banks closed, including 18 banks in New York in a single day, Chemical developed a reputation for stability.  This reputation proved extremely important in Chemical's growth during subsequent recessions during the 1860s.  Chemical frequently used the refrain "Good as gold then, good as gold today" in advertisements from the 1860s well into the 20th century.Reaching the Man who Reads as he Runs.  Printers' ink, A Journal for Advertisers, Vol CXIX No. 1, April 6, 1922 Chemical received its national charter as the Chemical National Bank of New York in 1865, at the urging of the secretary of the treasury.  This allowed Chemical to issue government-backed national bank notes, the forerunner to paper money. By the early 1870s, Chemical had accumulated deposits in excess of $6 million. A contemporary perspective of Chemical from 1893 described the bank as follows:  By the first decade of the 20th century, Chemical had one of the strongest reputations in banking but as a business was in decline, losing accounts each year.  Unlike many of its peers, Chemical had been reluctant to expand into securities and other businesses and had not paid interest on bank accounts.  Both practices, considered to be highly conservative, had allowed Chemical to develop a large capital reserve but were not attracting customers.  William H. Porter, a prominent banker of the era, was named president of the bank in 1903 after the death of the previous president George G. Williams.  Porter would leave Chemical seven years later to become a partner at J.P. Morgan & Co. in 1910 and was succeeded by Joseph B. Martindale, who was named president in 1911.The Chemical National Bank.  The Independent, Volume 70, p.62. In 1917, Chemical named a new president of the bank, Herbert Twitchell,To Head Chemical Bank.; Herbert K. Twitchell Elected Successor to Joseph B. Martindale. New York Times, July 17, 1917 after the death of Joseph B. Martindale.

Hunt.Martindale Theft Still in a Maze.  New York Times, September 16, 1917Martindale Short $300,000 as Head of Chemical Bank.  New York Times, September 12, 1917 Twitchell initiated a major turnaround of Chemical, setting up a trust business and reversing Chemical's policy of not paying interest on cash accounts.   These steps along with other initiatives, resulted in an increase in deposits from $35 million to $81 million by 1920.  In 1920, Twitchell was succeeded by Percy H. Johnston and remained with the bank as chairman of the board.Knowledge is power: the life story of Percy Hampton Johnston, banker.

New York Times, March 19, 1920  In 1923 Chemical established its first branch and by the end of the 1920s had opened a dozen branches in Manhattan and Brooklyn as well as a branch in London, its first international presence. In 1929, Chemical reincorporated as a state bank in New York as Chemical Bank & Trust Company and merged with the United States Mortgage & Trust Company, headquartered on the Madison Avenue and 74th Street.Depression-Era Alternatives to the Mattress Stash.  New York Times, January 23, 2009The crash and its aftermath: a history of securities markets in the United States.  1985, p. 100  During the Depression-era of the 1930s, Chemical's deposits grew by more than 40% and in 1941, the bank reached $1 billion of assets.  During this period, Chemical also established Chemical National Company a securities underwriting business. In 1947, after the retirement of Percy Johnston, Harold Holmes Helm was named the new president of Chemical and would serve first as president and later as chairman of the bank for the next 18 years until his retirement in 1965.  Under Helm, Chemical completed a series of large mergers in the late 1940s and early 1950s that again made the bank among the largest in the U.S.  In 1947, Chemical merged with Continental Bank and Trust Company.  Then in 1954, Chemical would merge with the Corn Exchange Bank and only five years later merge again with the New York Trust Company. Chemical completed its largest acquisition to that point, in 1954, merging with the Corn Exchange Bank to become the Chemical Corn Exchange Bank.  Founded in 1853, the Corn Exchange Bank was based in New York City, but had built a network of branches in other states through the acquisition of community banks.The Corn Exchange Bank; A 'Noble Monument to Thrift' With an Unusually Modern Air.  New York Times, November 1, 1987  The merger with the Corn Exchange Bank added 98 additional branches to Chemical's system largely in the New York City and $774 million in deposits. In 1959, the bank, now known as Chemical Corn Exchange Bank, merged with New York Trust Company, effectively doubling the size of the company.  New York Trust Company, which had a large trust and wholesale-banking business, specialized in servicing large industrial accounts. At the time of the merger, Chemical Corn was the fourth largest bank in New York and New York Trust was the ninth largest bank and the merger created the third largest bank in New York, and the fourth largest in the U.S. with $3.8 billion of assets.Hulbert Aldrich, 87; Banking Executive Led New York Trust.  New York Times, January 9, 1995  Following the merger, the bank dropped the usage of the "corn exchange" from the corporate name to become the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company. In 1968, Chemical reorganized itself as a bank holding company which allowed for more rapid expansion.New Status for Chemical Bank.  New York Times, November 30, 1968  Throughout the early 1960s Chemical had begun to expand into New York's suburbs, opening branches on Long Island and in Westchester County.  However, by the late 1960s and early 1970s, Chemical was focused on building its international business.  In these years, Chemical opened new offices in Frankfurt, Germany (1969), Zurich, Switzerland (1971), Brussels, Belgium (1971), Paris, France  (1971) and Tokyo, Japan (1972). In 1975, Chemical acquired Security National Bank, which had a branch network on Long Island.  Chemical continued pursuing acquisitions, throughout the 1980s notably its acquisitions of Texas Commerce Bank (1986) and Horizon Bancorp (1986) as well as its attempted takeover of Florida National Bank (1982). Chemical and Florida National Bank agreed, in 1982, to enter into a merger, after laws preventing interstate banking were lifted, giving Chemical an option to acquire the business.Florida Bank's Special Meeting.

Throughout all of these acquisitions, Chemical's original management team, led by Walter V. Shipley, remained in charge of the bank.  When the combined bank purchased J.P. Morgan & Co., William B. Harrison, Jr., who had been a longtime Chemical executive, was named CEO of the combined firm.  Additionally, many of Chemical's businesses remained intact through the various mergers.  Chemical's private equity group for example, was renamed multiple times, ultimately becoming JP Morgan Partners before completing a spin-out from the bank, as CCMP Capital, after the bank's 2004 merger with Bank One.  Additionally, JPMorgan Chase retains Chemical's pre-1996 stock price history, as well as Chemical's old headquarters at 270 Park Avenue.                       Chemical was among the pioneers of electronic online banking.  On September 2, 1969, Chemical installed the first automated teller machine (ATM) at its branch in Rockville Centre, New York.
