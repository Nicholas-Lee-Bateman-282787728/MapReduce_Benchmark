 DynCorp International The pronunciation of the company has been confused in the past, with mispronunciations such as "Dine-Core" (silent "p") and "Dine-uh-Core" commonplace; the proper pronunciation is "Dine-Corp", which includes the "p" sound, as stated by Herb Lanese, the new CEO, at an employee town hall meeting, January 2007 in Fort Worth. is a USA-based private military contractor. Begun as an aviation company, the company also provides flight operations support, training and mentoring, international development, intelligence training and support, contingency operations, security, and operations and maintenance of land vehicles.Corrin, Amber. DynCorp cracks top 20 with $3B in prime contracts. Washington Technology. June 14, 2011. DynCorp receives more than 96% of its more than $3 billion  in annual revenues from the U.S. federal government. The corporate headquarters are in an unincorporated part of Fairfax County near Falls Church, Virginia. However, the company's contracts are managed from its office at Alliance Airport in Fort Worth, Texas. The company has provided services for the U.S. military in several theaters, including Bolivia, Bosnia, Somalia, Angola, Haiti, Colombia, Kosovo and Kuwait. DynCorp International also provided much of the security for Afghan interim president Hamid Karzai's presidential guard and trains much of Afghanistan's and Iraq's fledgling police force. DynCorp was also hired to assist recovery in Louisiana and neighboring areas after Hurricane Katrina. DynCorp has held one contract on every round of competition since receiving the first Contract Field Teams contract in 1951. DynCorp won the LOGCAP II contract and is one of three contract holders on the current LOGCAP IV contract. DynCorp traces its origins from two companies formed in 1946: California Eastern Airways (CEA), an air freight business, and Land-Air Inc., an aircraft maintenance company.McCarthy, Glenda. Computer Sciences to Buy DynCorp. The Los Angeles Times. December 14, 2002. California Eastern Airways was founded by a small group of returning World War II pilots who wanted to break into the air cargo business.Baum, Dan. This Gun For Hire. Wired. February 2003. They were one of the first firms to ship cargo by air, and within a year, the firm was serving both coasts.Merle, Renae. Computer Sciences Plans to Acquire DynCorp. The Washington Post. December 14, 2002.DynCorp. Funding Universe. California Eastern Airways diversified into multiple government aviation and managerial jobs, airlifted supplies for the Korean War, and was responsible for the White Sands Missile Range (a client that DynCorp has retained for 50 years). In 1951, Land-Air Inc., which implemented the first Contract Field Teams (teams of technicians that maintained military aircraft for the United States Air Force), was bought by California Eastern Aviation Inc.Overview. DynCorp International. DynCorp still holds the contract 50 years later, maintaining rotary and fixed-wing aircraft for all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. At this time, revenues for the company reached $6 million. In 1952, the company, renamed to California Eastern Aviation, Inc., merged with Air Carrier Service Corporation (AIRCAR), which sold commercial aircraft and spare parts to foreign airlines and governments. By 1961, California Eastern Aviation needed a new name to reflect the growing and diversifying company. The name "Dynalectron Corporation" was selected from 5,000 employee suggestions. In 1976, Dynalectron established their headquarters in McLean, Virginia.Fuel Hopes Spur Dynalectron; Work Begun on Process in 1963. The New York Times. June 20, 1979. Due to its growing size, the company restructured into four main operating groups: Specialty Contracting, Energy, Government Services, and Aviation Services. In the 30 years following the foundation of CEA, Dynalectron had acquired 19 companies in 30 years, had assets of $88 million, maintained a backlog of $250 million, employed 7,000, and had annual sales of $300 million. In 1964, Dynalectron diversified into the energy services business with the acquisition of Hydrocarbon Research, Inc.Dynalectron Seeks to Buy Hydrocarbon Research Stock. The Wall Street Journal. September 13, 1963. Through this acquisition, Dynalectron developed a process called H-Coal, which converted coal into synthetic liquid fuels.Jones, William H. (July 12, 1978). "Dynalectron Has An Oil Answer; New Process For Coal Conversion." The Washington Post. The work began to attract national attention with the Arab Oil Embargos of the 1970s.Fuel Hopes Spur Dynalectron; Work Begun on Process in 1963. The New York Times. June 20, 1979. "The current petroleum shortfall and renewed interest in synthetic fuels have made the stock of Dynalectron, a small suburban Washington concern with a coal-to-oil process, one of the hottest issues on the American Stock Exchange." By the early 1980s, Texaco Inc., Ruhrkohle AG, and C. Itoh & Co. were all marketing Dynalectron's H-Oil process."Texaco to Buy Dynalectron Oil Process; Texaco Plans 50% Purchase Of Dynalectron Oil Process." The Washington Post. January 14, 1981."Dynalectron to Study Plan For Chinese Synfuel Plant." The Washington Post. December 25, 1981. Between 1976 and 1981, the company had two public stock offerings and acquired another 14 companies.Leibovich, Mark. DynCorp Letter May Offer . . . a Hint. The Washington Post. August 4, 1988. By 1986, Dynaelectron was one of the largest defense contractors in North America.  In 1987, Dynalectron changed its name to DynCorp. In 1988, DynCorp went private to avoid a hostile takeover by Miami financier Victor Posner.Tucker, Elizabeth. "Group Raises DynCorp Bid to $ 267 Million." The Washington Post. November 10, 1987. "DynCorp, the McLean high-technology and services company that last week agreed to be taken private in a leveraged buyout worth $ 248 million, said yesterday that the buying group had raised its price to $ 267.3 million to top an offer from another bidder. The increased offer, made by an employe-management group led by DynCorp President Dan R. Bannister, is equal to $ 24.75 a share, the company said.... Frumberg said DynCorp's plan to go private through the Bannister group's leveraged buyout was spurred by fear that Posner could be planning a hostile takeover attempt." The bid was an employee-led initiative spearheaded by Daniel R. Bannister. Bannister, who was paid $1.65 an hour when he joined DynCorp as an electronics technician in 1953, served as DynCorp's president and CEO from 1985 to 1997.Shapiro, T. Rees. Daniel R. Bannister former president of DynCorp, dies at 80. The Washington Post. March 15, 2011. By 1994, revenues exceeded $1 billion; by 1997, three years later, DynCorp earned $2.4 billion in annual revenue, had acquired an additional 40 companies, and employed 24,000 people. During this time, DynCorp operated missile test ranges for United States Department of Defense, developed vaccines for the National Institutes of Health, and installed security systems in U.S. embassies for the State Department. Dyncorp also supplied bodyguards to Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide in the 1990s and to Afghan President Hamid Karzai in the 2000s. In 1999, DynCorp moved their headquarters to Reston, Virginia. With the reductions in military spending in the 1990s, DynCorp expanded their focus to the growing tech market. They bought 19 digital and network service firms, and acquired contracts with the government's information technology (IT) departments. By 2003, roughly half of DynCorp's business came from managing the IT departments of the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, among others. In December 2000, DynCorp formed DynCorp International LLC, and transferred to it all of its international business to this entity while DynCorp Technical Services LLC continued to perform DynCorp's domestic contracts. In March 2003, DynCorp and its subsidiaries were acquired by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) for approximately US$914 million. Less than two years later, CSC announced the sale of three DynCorp units (DynCorp International, DynMarine and certain DynCorp Technical Services contracts) to Veritas Capital Fund, LP for US$850 million. After the sale, CSC retained the rights to the name "DynCorp" and the new company became DynCorp International.Merle, Renae. Computer Sciences Sells DynCorp Units. Washington Post. December 14, 2004. In 2006, DynCorp International went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DCP. On April 12, 2010, DynCorp International announced a conditional deal to be acquired by private equity investment firm Cerberus Capital Management at a price of $17.55 per share ($1 Billion). The deal was agreed on 7 July 2010. In December 2011 the company hired Michael Thibault, former co-chairman and commissioner of the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan (CWC), as vice president of government finance and compliance.

In this regard, concerning the company's activities and alleged abuses in Colombia, an extensive accusation was presented against DynCorp at the Hearing on Biodiversity of the Permanent Peoples' Tribunal, session on Colombia, which took place at the Cacarica Humanitarian Zone from February 24 to 27, 2007. Three DynCorp employees died when their helicopter was shot down during an anti-drug mission in Peru in 1992. On November 29, 2008, a lengthy New York Times article questioned the potential conflict of interest in the hiring by Veritas Capital Fund, LP, holding company for DynCorp, of Gen. Barry McCaffrey. McCaffrey had previously served as White House "Drug Czar" where he shaped future federal public-private partnership in drug enforcement policy. In the late 1990s, two employees, Ben Johnston, a former DynCorp aircraft mechanic, and Kathryn Bolkovac, a U.N. International Police Force monitor, independently alleged that DynCorp employees in Bosnia engaged in sex with minors, and sold them to each other as slaves. Both Johnston and Bolkovac were fired, and Johnston was later placed into protective custody before leaving several days later. On June 2, 2000, an investigation was launched in the DynCorp hangar at Comanche Base Camp, one of two U.S. bases in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all DynCorp personnel were detained for questioning. CID spent several weeks investigating and the results appear to support Johnston's allegations. DynCorp had fired five employees for similar illegal activities prior to the charges. Many of the employees accused of sex trafficking were forced to resign under suspicion of illegal activity. However, as of 2014 no one had been prosecuted. In 2002, Bolkovac filed a lawsuit in Great Britain against DynCorp for unfair dismissal due to a protected disclosure (whistleblowing), and won. Bolkovac co-authored a book with Cari Lynn titled The Whistleblower: Sex Trafficking, Military Contractors And One Woman's Fight For Justice. In 2010, a film titled The Whistleblower, starring Rachel Weisz and Vanessa Redgrave, was released.DynCorp International Statement on “The Whistleblower”. DynCorp International.Lynch, Colum. The Whistleblower: The movie the U.N. would prefer you didn't see. Foreign Policy. June 29, 2011. According to The New York Times, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) found that "DynCorp seemed to act almost independently of its reporting officers at the Department of State, billing the United States for millions of dollars of work that were not authorized and beginning other jobs without a go-ahead." The report states that the findings of DynCorp's misconduct on a $188 million job to buy weapons and build quarters for the Iraqi police were serious enough to warrant a fraud inquiry. A US government audit report of October 2007 revealed that $1.3 billion was spent on a contract with DynCorp for training Iraqi police. The auditors stated that the program was mismanaged to such an extent that they were unable to determine how the money was spent. In February 2007 federal auditors cited DynCorp for wasting millions on projects, including building an unapproved, Olympic-sized swimming pool at the behest of Iraqi police officials. In April 2011, DynCorp agreed to pay $7.7 million to the US government to settle claims that it had inflated claims for construction contracts in Iraq.Bloomberg L.P., "DynCorp To Settle Over Claims For Iraq Work". The Washington Post. 23 April 2011, p. 9. On October 11, 2007, a DynCorp security guard in a US State Department convoy killed a taxi driver in Baghdad. According to several witnesses, the taxi did not pose a threat to the security of the convoy. A January 2010 report by the SIGIR assessed that oversight of DynCorp police training contracts by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs found that INL exhibited weak oversight of the DynCorp task orders for support of the Iraqi police training program. It found that INL lacks sufficient resources and controls to adequately manage the task orders with DynCorp. As a result, more than $2.5 billion in U.S. funds were vulnerable to waste and fraud, although SIGAR's Iraq reconstruction inspector noted that there was no indication that DynCorp had misspent any of the $2.5 billion.Capaccio, Tony. Weak Oversight in Iraq Puts $2.5 Billion at Risk, Audit Says. Bloomberg. January 25, 2010. On July 30, 2010, a riot broke out when an Afghan car and a DynCorp vehicle crashed on a road near Kabul International Airport.Reid, Robert H. July the deadliest month of Afghan war for US. The New York Times. July 30, 2010. Although initial reports blamed the company and claimed four Afghans were killed in the accident, Sayed Abdul Ghaffar, the head of the Kabul police criminal investigations division, told The New York Times that the Afghan driver had caused the accident and said only one Afghan died in the wreck. In 2009, DynCorp contractors paid a 17-year-old Afghan Bacha Bazi performer to entertain them in Kunduz.  Several Afghans were later arrested and investigated. A Wikileaks cable released after the incident stated that the Afghan interior minister at the time, Hanif Atmar, asked the assistant US ambassador to try to "quash" both the story and release of video from the incident. In response to the incident, DynCorp fired four senior managers and established a chief compliance officer position, which focused on ethics, business conduct, related investigations, and regulatory compliance. As of 2014, no DynCorp employee has faced criminal charges. According to Mozambican media reports, the Mozambican government seized and impounded the 16-vehicle shipment pending the outcome of investigations into alleged tax evasion and deception by OTT Technologies Mozambique.
