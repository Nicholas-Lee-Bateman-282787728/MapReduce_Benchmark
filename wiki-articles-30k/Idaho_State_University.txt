     Idaho State University (ISU) is a Carnegie-classified doctoral research and teaching institution in the western United States, located in Pocatello, Idaho. A public university founded  in 1901 as the Academy of Idaho, ISU offers access to education in more than 280 programs at its main campus and at locations in Meridian, Idaho Falls, and Twin Falls.  It is the state's designated lead institution in health professions and medical education. There are 48 US states and 59 countries represented at ISU and 285 programs, including Master's and Doctorate programs. The student-teacher ratio is 17:1, gender of students is 44 percent male, 56 percent female, and ISU has more than 160 clubs and organizations. Enrollment for the fall semester in 2012 stood at 14,209, including 12,143 undergraduate students and 2,066 graduate students."ISU Headlines » Idaho State University announces fall 2012 enrollment." Idaho State University. N.p., 26 Oct. 2012. Web. 10 Nov. 2013. . On March 11, 1901, Governor Frank W. Hunt signed Senate Bill 53, to establish the Academy of Idaho, contingent upon private land donations being made for its site. Theodore F. Turner, mayor of Pocatello, settled the issue (Battle of the Blocks) of the placement of the academy. The Academy of Idaho was officially opened in Pocatello on May 1, 19012. Theodore Swanson, a member of the board of trustees, secured the services of John W. Faris as the first administrator, with the title of principal. Classes officially began in September 1902. By 1910, enrollment had reached nearly 300 students, and the academy had purchased four additional city blocks in Pocatello to help meet its growing needs. In 1915, the Academy of Idaho was renamed Idaho Technical Institute. The end of World War I brought an influx of students to the school, and enrollment surged to over 1,000. The early 1920s saw the beginning of competition in intercollegiate athletics. At this time the institute adopted the Bengal as the school mascot; head football coach Ralph Hutchinson (1920–27) was an alumnus of Princeton, a school with orange and black theme colors and a tiger mascot. It was renamed again in 1927, this time as the University of Idaho—Southern Branch, and continued as a two-year school, overseen by an executive dean, John R. Nichols. During World War II, Idaho was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission. Nichols decided to leave the college, and named Carl McIntosh, an associate professor of speech, as acting executive dean in January 1947. That March, the school was elevated to four-year status and became Idaho State College.Beal and Wells, p. 208. Nichols was so impressed with McIntosh's public speaking skills that he successfully persuaded the Board of Regents to appoint McIntosh the first president of the new college. At 32 years of age, he was one of the youngest college presidents in the United States."Dr. Carl W. McIntosh (1914-2009)." Bozeman Daily Chronicle. January 25, 2009. Although McIntosh was not originally interested in being an administrator, once the school became an independent college he decided he wanted to remain president and see it through its early growing pains. The college was accredited as a four-year degree granting institution in December 1948. Enrollment reached 2,000 in 1949. McIntosh left ISC in 1959 to become president of Long Beach State College, and was cucceeded by Donald E. Walker. In 1963, ISC was renamed for the fifth and final time to Idaho State University, reflecting its new status as a full four-year public university. In the ensuing years, ISU continuously expanded both its enrollment and the programs it offered. The presidency of Richard Bowen, from 1985–2005, is particularly regarded as an era of growth: as of 2006, ISU had colleges in arts and sciences, business, education, engineering, health, pharmacy, and technology. However, Bowen resigned after a vote of no confidence from the faculty, who were angered by generous pay raises for administration members in the midst of calls for fiscal austerity. Arthur Vailas, former vice chancellor of the University of Houston System and vice president of the University of Houston in Texas, became president of ISU on July 1, 2006. He succeeded Michael Gallagher, who had served as interim president since Bowen's retirement in 2005. In February 2011, the ISU faculty voted no confidence in Vailas and called for his resignation. This was also followed by a vote of no confidence by the students. Although Vailas faced mounting criticism and pressure from faculty and students to step down, he refused to resign and campus tension intensified, as the Idaho State Board of Education decided to suspend the university's faculty senate. As a result, in June 2011, the American Association of University Professors censured the ISU. ISU, along with the Idaho National Laboratory and other Idaho universities, worked to establish the Center for Advanced Energy Studies in 2007. Renovation of the ESTEC building began in summer 2007, after the team of ISU's College of Technology, Idaho National Laboratory and Partners for Prosperity received grant funding totaling more than $2.5 million.ISU Headlines » Idaho Falls groundbreaking celebration Feb. 20 touted as start of new era in nation's energy future.
