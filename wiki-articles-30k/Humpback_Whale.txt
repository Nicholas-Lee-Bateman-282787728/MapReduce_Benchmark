    The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is a species of baleen whale. One of the larger rorqual species, adults range in length from  and weigh about . The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making it popular with whale watchers. Males produce a complex song lasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time. Its purpose is not clear, though it may have a role in mating. Found in oceans and seas around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up to  each year. Humpbacks feed only in summer, in polar waters, and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give birth in the winter when they fast and live off their fat reserves. Their diet consists mostly of krill and small fish. Humpbacks have a diverse repertoire of feeding methods, including the bubble net technique. Like other large whales, the humpback was a target for the whaling industry. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium. While stocks have partially recovered, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, and noise pollution continue to impact the population of 80,000.    Humpback whales are rorquals (Balaenopteridae, a family that includes the blue, fin, Bryde's, sei, and minke whales. The rorquals are believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene. However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other. Though clearly related to the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the humpback is the sole member of its genus. More recently, though, DNA sequencing analysis has indicated the humpback is more closely related to certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale (B. physalus), and possibly to the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), than it is to rorquals such as the minke whales. The humpback was first identified as baleine de la Nouvelle Angleterre by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his Regnum Animale of 1756. In 1781, Georg Heinrich Borowski described the species, converting Brisson's name to its Latin equivalent, Balaena novaeangliae. In 1804, Lacépède shifted the humpback from the family Balaenidae, renaming it B. jubartes. In 1846, John Edward Gray created the genus Megaptera, classifying the humpback as Megaptera longipinna, but in 1932, Remington Kellogg reverted the species names to use Borowski's novaeangliae. The common name is derived from the curving of their backs when diving. The generic name Megaptera from the Greek mega-/μεγα- "giant" and ptera/πτερα "wing", refers to their large front flippers. The specific name means "New Englander" and was probably given by Brisson due the regular sightings of humpbacks off the coast of New England. Genetic research in mid-2014 by the British Antarctic Survey confirmed that the separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Oceans are more distinct than previously thought. Some biologists believe that these should regarded as separate subspecies and that they are evolving independently.  A humpback whale can easily be identified by its stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring, and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles, and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which it typically lifts above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges. Humpbacks have 270 to 400 darkly colored baleen plates on each side of their mouths. The plates measure from  in the front to about  in the back, behind the hinge. Ventral grooves run from the lower jaw to the umbilicus about halfway along the underside of the whale. These grooves are less numerous (usually 14–22) than in other rorquals, but are fairly wide. The female has a hemispherical lobe about  in diameter in her genital region. This visually distinguishes males and females. The male's penis usually remains hidden in the genital slit. Fully grown males average . Females are slightly larger at ; one large recorded specimen was  long and had pectoral fins measuring  each. The largest humpback on record, according to whaling records, was a female killed in the Caribbean; she was  long with a weight of , although the reliability of this information is unconfirmed due to illogicality of the record.Vallarta Adventures. Whale Watching Guide. Re-retrieved on November 7, 2014 Body mass typically is in the range of , with large specimens weighing over . Newborn calves are roughly the length of their mother's head. At birth, calves measure  at . They nurse for about six months, then mix nursing and independent feeding for possibly six months more. Humpback milk is 50% fat and pink in color. Females reach sexual maturity at age five, achieving full adult size a little later. Males reach sexual maturity around seven years of age. The long black and white tail fin, which can be up to a third of body length. The pectoral fins have unique patterns, which make individual whales identifiable. Several hypotheses attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any cetacean. Possibly the higher maneuverability afforded by long fins and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates supported this adaptation. The varying patterns on the tail flukes are sufficient to identify individuals. A study using data from 1973 to 1998 on whales in the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates, and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating the mark-release-recapture technique.Katona and Beard 1982 A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is maintained by College of the Atlantic. Similar photographic identification projects operate around the world. 200px" heights="200px Humpback whale skeleton on display at The Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Mother and calf in Boston Harbor A humpback whale tail displaying wavy rear edges|alt=Photo showing humpback with only white underside of tail visible A tail from a different individual—the tail of each humpback whale is visibly unique.|alt=Photo of vertical humpback displaying only white tail underside and rear body segment Individual identification in Vava'u, Tonga The lifespan of rorquals ranges from 45 to 100 years.Dawes 2008, p.291    The humpback social structure is loose-knit. Typically, individuals live alone or in small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. Groups may stay together longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. Some females possibly retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. The humpback's range overlaps considerably with other whale and dolphin species—for instance, the minke whale.  Courtship rituals take place during the winter months, following migration toward the equator from summer feeding grounds closer to the poles. Competition is usually fierce, and unrelated males, dubbed escorts, frequently trail females, as well as cow-calf pairs. Males gather into "competitive groups" around a female and fight for the right to mate with her. Group size ebbs and flows as unsuccessful males retreat and others arrive. Behaviors include breaching, spyhopping, lob-tailing, tail-slapping, pectoral fin-slapping, peduncle throws, charging, and parrying. Whale song is thought to have an important role in mate selection; however, they may also be used between males to establish dominance. Females typically breed every two or three years. The gestation period is 11.5 months.  The peak months for birth are January, February (Northern Hemisphere), July and August (Southern Hemisphere). Females generally take a one- to two–year break after breeding.  Recent research on mitochondrial DNA reveals that groups living in proximity to each other may represent distinct breeding pools. Humpbacks, known to be a friendly species, often interact with other cetacean species such as bottlenose dolphins. Right whales are often seen to interact with humpbacks,[ ] and these behaviors have been recorded in all oceans. A record of a humpback and a southern right whale demonstrating what was thought to be a mating behaviors was documented off the Mozambique coast. Humpback whales are also known to appear in mixed groups with other species, such as the blue whale, fin whale, minke whale, gray whale, and sperm whale. Interaction with gray, fin, and right whales have been observed. Interactions with right whales were recorded in all oceans.Rare Sighting of a North Pacific Right Whale (Eubalaena glacialis) in Hawai'iCenter for Coastal Studies. 2007. Center for Coastal Studies / Right Whale Research / Field Notes / 2007 / May 2007 Retrieved on December 05. 2015 Teams of researchers observed a male humpback whale singing an unknown type of song and approaching a fin whale at Rarotonga in 2014. One individual was observed playing with a bottlenose dolphin in Hawaiian waters.  Both male and female humpback whales vocalize, but only males produce the long, loud, complex "song" for which the species is famous. Each song consists of several sounds in a low register, varying in amplitude and frequency, and typically lasting from 10 to 20 minutes. Individuals may sing continuously for more than 24 hours. Cetaceans have no vocal cords, so generate their songs by forcing air through their massive nasal cavities (blowholes). Whales within a large area sing a single song. All North Atlantic humpbacks sing the same song, while those of the North Pacific sing a different song. Each population's song changes slowly over a period of years without repeating. Scientists are unsure of the purpose of whale songs. Only males sing, suggesting one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets. Humpback whales have also been found to make a range of other social sounds to communicate, such as grunts, groans, "thwops", snorts, and barks.Cecilia Burke, 'A whale's varied vocabulary', Australian Geographic, AG Online. Retrieved August 7, 2010. Whales are air-breathing mammals that must surface to get the air they need. The stubby dorsal fin is visible soon after the blow when the whale surfaces, but disappears by the time the flukes emerge. Humpbacks have a , heart-shaped to bushy blow, or exhalation of water through the blowholes. They do not generally sleep at the surface, but must continue to breathe. Possibly only half of their brain sleeps at one time, allowing the other half to surface, blow, and return to the deep without awakening the other half. Migratory patterns and social interactions were explored in the 1960s and by further studies in 1971. The Calambokidis et al. 2001 report provided the "first quantitative assessment of the migratory structure of humpback whales in the entire North Pacific basin." Humpbacks inhabit all major oceans, in a wide band running from the Antarctic ice edge to 77° N latitude.The four global populations are North Pacific, Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and Indian Ocean populations. These populations are distinct. Whales were once uncommon in the eastern Mediterranean or the Baltic Sea, but have increased their presence in both waters as global populations have recovered.Frey S.. Panigada S.. Pierantonio N..

In the North Atlantic, humpack whale stocks have feeding areas ranging from Scandinavia to New England and breed in the Caribbean and Cape Verde. In the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, whales stocks may breed off Brazil, as well the coasts of gentral, southern and southeastern Africa (including Madagascar). Whales' visits into Gulf of Mexico have been infrequent, but earlier occur in the gulf historically. A large population spreads across the Hawaiian Islands every winter, ranging from the island of Hawaii in the south to Kure Atoll in the north. These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century, and might have gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.Right Whale Balaena glacialis Sightings Near Hawaii: A Clue to the Wintering Grounds? A 2007 study identified seven individuals wintering off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica as having traveled from the Antarctic—around . Identified by their unique tail patterns, these animals made the longest documented mammalian migration. In Australia, two main migratory populations have been identified, off the west and east coasts. These two populations are distinct, with only a few females in each generation crossing between the two groups. In Panama and Costa Rica, humpback whales come from both the Southern Hemisphere, July–October with over 2,000 whales, and the Northern Hemisphere, December–March numbering about 300.Whale Watching Panama. Why Panama?. Retrieved on December 18. 2014 South Pacific populations migrating off mainland New Zealand, Kermadec Islands,  and Tasmania are increasing, but less rapidly than in Australian waters because of illegal whaling by the Soviet Union in the 1970s. Some recolonizing habitats are confirmed especially in North and South Atlantic (e.g. English and Irish coasts, English Channel to coasts in the north such as the North Sea and Wadden Sea, South Pacific (e.g. New Zealand coasts and Niue), southern fiords of Chile and Peru (e.g. Gulf of Penas, Strait of Magellan, Beagle Channel) and in Asia. Areas in the Philippines such as in Babuyan Islands and Pasaleng Bay, Ryukyu Islands the Volcano Islands in Japan and the Northern Mariana Islands, again became stable/growing wintering grounds while Vietnamese, Taiwanese, and Chinese coasts show slow or no obvious recovery. Off Japanese coasts, whales again began to migrate off Japanese archipelagos and into Sea of Japan. Connections between these stocks and whales seen in Sea of Okhotsk, on Kamchatka coasts, and around Commander Islands have been studied. Since in November 2015, whales suddenly started gathering around Hachijō-jima which is far north from the known breeding areas in Bonin Islands, and all the breeding activities except for giving births have been confirmed as of January, 2016.http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20160129/k10010389751000.html If breeding would be confirmed, then Hachijo-jima is the northernmost location of breeding grounds in the world, even in more north than newer breeding grounds with latitudes higher than the other major wintering grounds such as Amami Ōshima,http://amamiwhale.jimdo.com/ Midway Islands,http://www.pifsc.noaa.gov/qrb/2011_06/article_05.php and Bermudas.http://www.whalesbermuda.com/ The island has not been either a congregating or a resting area for whales until this time, and it is unknown what are the factors leading whales to Hachijo-jima, and several reasons have been speculated such as warmer waters or humpback population at Bonin Islands could have reached carrying capacity.http://www9.nhk.or.jp/nw9/marugoto/2015/12/1218.html They are generally migratory, spending summers in cooler, high-latitude waters, and mating and calving in tropical and subtropical waters. An exception to this rule is a population in the Arabian Sea, which remains in these tropical waters year-round. The Indian Ocean population also does not migrate, prevented by that ocean's northern coastline. Annual migrations up to  are typical, making it one of the mammals' most-traveled species. Genetic studies and visual surveys indicate that Arabian group is the most isolated of all humpback groups in the world, and being the most endangered, counting possibly below 100 animals.http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/132835/0  200px" heights="200px Arabian Sea Humpback whales in Dhofar, Oman          Humpbacks feed primarily in summer and live off fat reserves during winter.Encyclopedia of Life & Peter Saundry. 2011. Humpback whale. eds. C.Michael Hogan and C.J.Cleveland, Encyclopedia of Earth, National Council for Science and Environment, Washington, DC  They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as herring, salmon, capelin, and American sand lance, as well as Atlantic mackerel, pollock, and haddock in the North Atlantic. Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.  The humpback has the most diverse hunting repertoire of all baleen whales. Its most inventive technique is known as bubble net feeding; a group of whales swims in a shrinking circle blowing bubbles below a school of prey. The shrinking ring of bubbles encircles the school and confines it in an ever-smaller cylinder. This ring can begin near  in diameter and involve the cooperation of a dozen animals. Using a crittercam attached to a whale's back, researchers found that some whales blow the bubbles, some dive deeper to drive fish toward the surface, and others herd prey into the net by vocalizing.  The whales then suddenly swim upward through the "net", mouths agape, swallowing thousands of fish in one gulp. Pleated grooves in the whale's mouth allow the creature to easily drain all the water initially taken in. So-called lobtail feeding was observed among in the North Atlantic. This technique involves the whale slapping the surface of the ocean with its tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net. Using network-based diffusion analysis, study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey. Visible scars indicate that killer whales can prey upon juvenile humpbacks, though until recently hunting had never been witnessed, and attacks were assumed to be superficial in nature. However, a 2014 study off Western Australia observed that when available in large numbers, young humpbacks will be attacked and sometimes killed by orcas. Moreover, mothers and (possibly related) adults escort neonates to avoid such predation. The suggestion is that when humpbacks suffered near-extinction during the whaling era, the orcas turned to other prey, but are now resuming this former activity.   Humpback whales were hunted as early as the 18th century, after they were identified by whalers in the first decades of the 17th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean, and to a lesser extent in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century introduction of the explosive harpoon, though, allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the Antarctic Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.Breiwick JM, Mitchell E, Reeves RR (1983) Simulated population trajectories for northwest Atlantic humpback whales 1865–1980. Fifth biennial Conference on Biology of Marine Mammals, Boston Abstract. p14 In 1946, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was founded to oversee the industry.  They imposed hunting regulations and created hunting seasons. To prevent extinction, IWC banned commercial humpback whaling in 1966. By then, the global population had been reduced to around 5,000. The ban remained in force as of 2015. Prior to commercial whaling, populations could have reached 125,000. North Pacific kills alone are estimated at 28,000. The Soviet Union deliberately under-recorded its catches; the Soviets reported catching 2,820, but the true number was over 48,000. As of 2004, hunting of humpback whales was restricted to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island of Bequia in the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The take is not believed to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its JARPA II research program. The announcement sparked global protests.scoop.co.nz: Leave Humpback Whales Alone Message To Japan 16 May 2007 After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years it would take to reach a formal agreement. In 2010, the IWC authorized Greenland's native population to hunt a few humpback whales for the next three years. In Japan, humpback, minkes, sperm, and many other smaller Odontoceti, including critically endangered species such as North Pacific right, western gray, and northern fin, have been targets of illegal captures. The hunts use harpoons for dolphin hunts or intentionally drive whales into nets, reporting them as cases of entanglements. Humpback meat can be found in markets. In one case, humpbacks of unknown quantities were illegally hunted in the EEZs of anti-whaling nations such as off [[Mexico]] and [[South Africa]].<ref name="Ogino05">Ogino M.

Humpbacks are generally curious about objects in their environments. Some individuals, referred to as "friendlies", approach whale-watching boats closely, often staying under or near the boat for many minutes. Because humpbacks are typically easily approachable, curious, identifiable as individuals, and display many behaviors, they have become the mainstay of whale-watching tourism in many locations around the world. Hawaii has used the concept of "[[ecotourism]]" to benefit from the species without killing them. This business brings in a revenue of $20 million per year for the state's economy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Whale Watching in Hawai`i|publisher=Office of National Marine Sanctuaries|accessdate=6 August 2012|url=http://hawaiihumpbackwhale.noaa.gov/explore/whale_watching.html}}</ref>  {{Clear}} {| class="wikitable" |- ! !

The report was based on data collected from 2004 to 2006. At the time, the North Pacific population was some 18,302.<ref name="SPLASH" /> The estimate is consistent with a moderate rate of recovery for a depleted population, although it was considered to be a "dramatic increase in abundance" from other post-1960s estimates.
