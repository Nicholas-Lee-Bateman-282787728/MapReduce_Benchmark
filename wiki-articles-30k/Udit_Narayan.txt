Udit Narayan has appeared in Jo Jeeta Wohi Super Star and Sa Re Ga Ma Pa little Champs as a guest. Udit Narayan is a resident of Mumbai. He has married twice: to Ranjana Narayan Jha and Deepa Narayan Jha. Udit was married to Ranjana Jha but dumped her soon. Initially Udit has denied the alleagation being married to Ranjana and singer had even gone to the extent of saying that Jha's claim was part of a conspiracy to tarnish his image. Bihar Women's Commission Chairperson Manju Prakash on 22 June 2006 had given 48 hours to Narayan for an 'out of court settlement and meaningful reconciliation' with Jha failing which she had threatened to issue a warrant of arrest against him. Jha, who had demanded restoration of her rights as the wife of Narayan, had met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar a day after the singer refused to acknowledge her as his spouse at the hotel on April 21. She later took up the issue with the women's panel which issued six summonses to Narayan, but he failed to appear before it.Taking a serious note of his repeated failure to present himself before it, the Commission had on 22 June 2006 given Narayan a week's time for an out-of-court-settlement on a petitioned filed by him through his counsel, then whittled it down to 48 hours.On the basis of photographs and statements of the people who claimed to have attended their marriage in 1984, the Commission had prima facie found Jha's claim to be true. Narayan's second wife, Deepa Narayan, whom he married in 1985, is primarily a Nepali Playback singer. The couple recorded a Hindi album together titled Dil Deewana. They have a son, Aditya Narayan, who is a former child actor, singer and television presenter. Aditya Narayan started his singing career as a child artist in a Nepali Film with his father before starting his singing career in Hindi films in the 1990s and acting career in the 2010s. Narayan acted in and sang all the songs in a 1985 Nepali movie called Kusume Rumal, which spent 25 weeks in the box office top ten list and became the highest-grossing Nepalese Movie of all time until overtaken in 2001 by another Tulsi Ghimire film, Darpan Chaya.
