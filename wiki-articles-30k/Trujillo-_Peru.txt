   Trujillo is a city in coastal northwestern Peru and the capital of La Libertad Region. It is the centre of the second most populous city of the country and the second most populous metropolitan area of Peru. It is located on the banks of the Moche River, near its mouth at the Pacific Ocean, in the Moche Valley. This was a site of the great prehistoric Moche and Chimu cultures before the Inca conquest and subsequent expansion. The Independence of Trujillo from Spain was proclaimed in the Historic Centre of Trujillo on December 29, 1820, and the city was honored in 1822 by the congress of the republic with the title "Meritorious City and Faithful to the Fatherland","Sucesos, información histórica", RPP Noticias, Reviewed July 29, 2008. for its role in the fight for independence.

For tourist, Trujillo offers very good places like restaurants and hotels, some of then run by Europeans such as Saint Etienne Hotel, Il Valentino Pizzeria, Metropolitan Restaurant, all of them are located in a reach zone: San Andres, this area is called the Miraflores of Trujillo because is reach, safety and it is located next to historical center of Trujillo. Other good places in the city are El Paisa, if you like marine food, El Romano Criollo for typical food and B&B Orrego Hotel if one likes low prices and good quality. Trujillo is close to two major archeological sites of pre-Columbian monuments: Chan Chan, the largest adobe city in the ancient world, designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986; and the temples of the Sun and Moon (the largest adobe pyramid in Peru). The city center contains many examples of colonial and religious architecture, often incorporating distinctive wrought ironwork. It includes residential areas, a central business district, and industrial supply distribution to the various districts. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trujillo has its seat here. Catholicism is the predominant religion and 10 colonial churches are located within the old city wall, now encircled by Avenida España; additional churches in the towns of Huaman, Huanchaco and Moche are located within 15 kilometres of Trujillo's centre. Since 2011, the city has been developing the pilot project Trujillo: Sustainable City, as part of the platform, "Emerging and Sustainable Cities of the Inter-American Development Bank," in cooperation with the IDB. In 2012 Trujillo was selected by IBM to participate in a "Smarter Cities Challenge" project intended to improve public safety and transportation through technology. Trujillo is considered the "Capital of Culture of Peru" for the prominent writers who were formed in the city such as Cesar Vallejo and Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, and because the city is a center for important cultural expressions as the marinera dance, Peruvian Paso horses, caballitos de totora, Trujillo's gastronomy, etc. The North Group was formed here, with Eduardo González Viaña and Gerardo Chavez as successors. The city presents important national festivals, such as Marinera Festival, Spring Festival, and competitions for the Peruvian Paso Horse and caballito de totora.  The Coat of arms of the Peruvian city of Trujillo was awarded on December 7, 1537 by Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain, Charles V. The shield consists of two columns of azure water, a king's crown on top surrounded by pearls and precious stones and two poles that embrace the columns K (Karolus initial, name of the King); and on the back is a griffin (mythological creature half lion-half eagle) facing right and embracing the shield. It is white in the center and carries the coat of arms of the city, and it is carried during the official ceremonies of the Municipality of Trujillo in the main square of the city. Also it is flown every December 29 to commemorate the proclamation of independence of Trujillo in 1820. The hymn was written by Ramiro Mendoza Sanchez with music composed by Ramiro Herrera Orbegoso. The hymn is performed mainly for official civic ceremonies, by bands of musicians. The hymn expresses greetings and appreciation to the city through its history. The history of Trujillo city has its beginning in ancient times, as the area at the mouth of the Moche River was long a center of succeeding pre-Columbian cultures. They extended their domains along the northern coast of Peru. Archaeological history of this region goes back to the early preceramic period. For example, Huaca Prieta was occupied as early as 4700 BC. Several ancient cultures developed in this area: the Cupisnique, the Mochica and Chimú. Numerous archaeological sites and monumental remains attest to the high degree of complexity of these civilizations. Among the Cupisnique culture sites are Caballo Muerto and Huaca Prieta. The Moche culture sites include huacas: the Temples of the Sun and Moon south of the city, the Huaca del Dragon or Rainbow and Huaca Esmeralda to the north, and others. The Chimu culture built its primary settlement at what is known as Chan Chan, which was the capital, having an estimated 100,000 people at its peak. It is the largest pre-Columbian city built of adobe and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its remains are 5&nbsp;km from downtown to the northwest of the current metropolitan area. The present Spanish-Peruvian city of Trujillo was founded in an ancestral territory populated by ancient indigenous civilizations. The Spanish founded new cities expressing their culture in what they called the "Viceroyalty of Peru".  The Moche civilization flourished in northern Peru with its Huacas del Sol y de la Luna from about 100 AD to 800 AD, during the Regional Development Epoch. The people likely had formed into a group autonomous polities that shared a common elite culture, as seen in the rich iconography and monumental architecture that survive today. They are particularly noted for their elaborately painted ceramics, gold work, monumental constructions (huacas) and irrigation systems. Moche history is broadly divided into three periods&nbsp;– the emergence of the Moche culture in Early Moche (AD 100–300), its expansion and florescence during Middle Moche (AD 300–600), and the urban nucleation and subsequent collapse in Late Moche (AD 500–750).Bawden, G. 2004. "The Art of Moche Politics", in Andean Archaeology. (ed. H. Silverman). Oxford: Blackwell Publishers Moche society was agriculturally based, and the cultural leaders invested in the construction of a network of irrigation canals for the diversion of river water to supply the crops. Their culture was sophisticated; and their artifacts fully express their lives, including scenes of hunting, fishing, fighting, sacrifice, elaborate ceremonies, and sexual acts. The Chimú built and occupied a territory known as Chimor, with its capital at the city of Chan Chan, a large adobe city in the Valley of Moche (present-day Trujillo city developed around it). The culture arose about 900 and flourished into the 14th century. The Inca ruler Tupac Inca Yupanqui led a campaign which conquered the Chimu around 1470.Kubler, George. (1962). The Art and Architecture of Ancient America, Ringwood: Penguin Books Australia Ltd., pp. 247–274 This was just 50 years before the arrival of the Spanish in the region. Consequently, Spanish chroniclers recorded accounts of Chimu culture from persons who had lived before the Inca conquest. Similarly, archaeological evidence suggest Chimor emerged from the remnants of Moche culture; early Chimú pottery had some resemblance to that of the Moche. Their ceramics are all black, and their work in precious metals is very detailed and intricate. In the late Chimú, about 12,000 artisans lived and worked in Chan Chan alone.Moseley, M. E. & Cordy-Collins, A. (Ed.) (1990). The Northern Dynasties: Kingships and Statecraft in Chimor. Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks They engaged in fishing, agriculture, craft work, and trade. Artisans were forbidden to change their profession, and were grouped together in the ciudadela according to their area of specialization. Archeologists have noted a dramatic rise in the volume of Chimú craft production, which they attribute to artisans having been brought to Chan Chan from another area taken in conquest. As there is evidence of both metalwork (generally a male specialty) and weaving (a female art) in the same domestic dwelling, it is likely that both men and women were artisans. The men engaged in fishing, heavy agriculture (aided by irrigation and earthworks), and metallurgy. The women made ceramics and textiles (from spun and dyed cotton, llama, alpaca, and vicunas wool). People used reed fishing canoes, hunted, and traded using bronze coins.  Trujillo was one of the first cities in the Americas founded by the Spanish conquistadors.Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, ISBN 9781420941142 They arrived in an area that had been inhabited and developed for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. According to historian Napoleón Cieza Burga, the conquistador Diego de Almagro founded the first settlement on November 1534, calling it Trujillo of New Castilla, after the home city of Francisco Pizarro. It was founded among four Chimu settlements: Huanchaco, Huamán, Moche & Mampuesto, to create an alliance against the Incas. On November 23, 1537, King Charles I of Spain gave the town the rank of 'city' and the coat of arms that remains a symbol for the city; it was the first city in Peru to receive a coat of arms from the king. By 1544 Trujillo had around 300 homes and 1000 inhabitants, and an economy booming from the cultivation of sugar cane, wheat, and other food crops and the raising of livestock. The Spanish colonists welcomed a diverse array of religious orders from the time of its founding, and there was a boom in church construction in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1577 Pope Gregory XIII created the Diocese of Trujillo, and in 1616 construction work commenced on the cathedral. On February 14, 1619, Trujillo was struck by an earthquake, resulting in the near-total destruction of the city and the deaths of around 400 its inhabitants. Rebuilding was slow. The people developed a devotion to St Valentine, on whose day the earthquake hit. The Jesuits opened a seminary and school for the education and training of priests; they also served as missionaries to the indigenous peoples, as they introduced Christianity.    Due to the proximity of the city to the sea (about 4&nbsp;km) and the danger of attack by pirates and privateers, the Wall of Trujillo was built for defense during the reign of Viceroy Melchor de Navarra and Rocafull and the city mayors Bartolome Martinez and Fernando Ramirez Jarabeitia Orellana. This wall was built by an Italian architect, Joseph Formento, who began construction on February 19, 1687. Formento based his design on that by Leonardo da Vinci for the Italian city of Florence. The wall was designed of elliptical shape to save costs in its construction, and was completed in 1689. The wall reached a perimeter of 5.5&nbsp;km and used more than 100,000 bricks. The defensive structure was composed of 15 bastions, 15 shades and 5 covered gates. The Huaman gate was oriented westward to the road to the village of the same name. The Mansiche gate was located to the north, giving way to the highway. The Miraflores gate opened to the east. The Sierra gate was named after the road leading to this region. Lastly, the Moche gate gave access to people coming from the south. In 1942 the city developed a master plan; following the path of the ancient wall, it built Avenida España to encircle the area now called the Historical Center of Trujillo. In the latter half of the 17th century, severe droughts and pestilence caused a major economic crisis for the city, which depended on agriculture. Trujillo regained prominence in the 18th century, in part due to the destruction of the city of Sana by flooding in 1720. Trujillo also suffered from flooding in 1701, 1720, 1728 and 1814; and earthquakes in 1725 and 1759. By 1760 an estimated 9200 people were living in the vicinity of the city. The foundation of the Municipality of Trujillo in 1779 coincided with a peak of prosperity for the city. Numerous undeveloped lots remained within the city walls but Trujillo was regarded as one of the most important cities in Northern Peru during the colonial era.   Inspired by liberal ideas from members of its educational institutions, Trujillo became a principal centre of Peruvian republican sentiments. Led by city major and the intendant José Bernardo de Tagle, the Intendancy of Trujillo declared its independence from Spain on December 29, 1820. Between 1821 and 1825 the Trujillo region was the only stable and productive land within the nascent republic. In 1823 Trujillo took on the role of the first capital city of the Republic of Peru. On July 19, 1823 the Peruvian Congress located here repeated its invitation to Simon Bolivar, a leader in Bolivia, to join the war of independence. In 1824 the city received the liberating army of Simon Bolivar, and was again designated as the seat of government. It is the only city to have twice been designated as the capital. The years following the revolution saw the growth in the economic influence of the city, compensating for a loss of political power to Lima when it was designated as the capital, which instead suffered from the resulting political turmoil. The Moche and Chicama valleys emerged as new economic enclaves for the sugar cane industry. Land was increasingly concentrated in large estates and a new "agricultural aristocracy" developed that was linked to and influenced national political power. The policy of free trade and openness to foreign investment attracted an influx of Europeans, principally from England and Germany. By then, Trujillo had a population of 15,000 and began to grow beyond the city walls. New architectural styles were adopted, influenced by French and English Romanticism. During the war with Chile between 1879 and 1883, Trujillo contributed troops towards national defence. Although never a site of battle, Trujillo suffered from occupation by Chilean troops and their plundering of the surrounding countryside. It is considered the "First Independent City of Peru" for three reasons: it proclaimed independence from Spain on December 24, 1820 at the historical "Casa de la Emancipación" (home of Emancipation). Its leaders signed the declaration of independence at the Seminario de San Carlos y San Marcelo and proclaimed independence to an open council meeting in the Plaza de Armas (main square), on December 29, 1820. Finally, on January 6, 1821 its leaders ratified the agreement and the proclamation of the independence of this city, as stated in the document called Libro rojo of the Trujillo council. Their actions gained independence for almost all of northern Peru, because the government of Trujillo city ruled what is now Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Cajamarca, San Martín and Amazonas. Marquis of Torre Tagle said, "My people. From this time for the unanimous will of the people, Trujillo is Free. I put our fate and that of people under the protection of Heaven !Long live the homeland! Long live independence!"    The Provisional Regulations given by General San Martin in 1821 created the "Department of Trujillo", based on colonial administration. This status was acknowledged in the first "Constitution of Peru", 1823. Because of its size and economic wealth, the "Department of Trujillo" between 1821 and 1825 was the only stable and productive area that could organize and lead the nascent republic. The Trujillo Department encompassed nearly half the country. For the efforts of its people in the war of emancipation, San Martin Protector gave it the title of "Meritorious City Loyal to the Homeland." The municipality of the city, then called a cabildo, was given the rank of "honorable". In 1823, after the creation of the Republic of Peru, the protectorate of Jose de San Martin was developed. Before royal troops took the city of Lima, the first President of Peru, Don Jose de la Riva Agüero, together with Sánchez Carrión, named Trujillo as provisional capital of the country, which survived for a short period. In 1824 the city received the liberating army of Simon Bolivar. Taking over the government of the country, he established temporary government of the country in Trujillo, on March 8, 1824. In 1821 the "Court of Appeals" was created to replace the Royal Court. Its jurisdiction extended over the present departments of Cajamarca, Piura, Lambayeque, Amazonas (then known as the Chachapoyas), and Huamachuco (then known as Sanchez Carrion). On March 26, 1824 Simón Bolivar established Trujillo's first Superior Court of Justice as the Northern Superior Court. It had been the first high court established in the Republic of Peru with the powers of the Supreme Court. By the end of 19th century the five entrances had disappeared from the city so it was that during this time, the Wall of Trujillo was torn down and allowed the growth of the city, this urban expansion allowed the establishment of the neighborhoods of Chicago, the Union and Pedro Muniz. During the administration of Don Victor Larco Herrera as mayor the city began upgrading works such as construction of City Hall, the arrangement and embellishment of the Plaza de Armas and the atrium of the Cathedral . It also built the double track to the resort of Buenos Aires, Larco avenue current, which expanded the city urban planning perspective. Another project was the renovation of the Municipal Theater.  From the 1980 Trujillo takes on the aspect and behavior of a metropolitan area particularly dynamic, by which time the growth of the city and adjoining districts, had produced conurbation of these, so, for the decade of the 1980s nascent Trujillo metropolitan area consisted of the integrated urban districts of Trujillo, El Porvenir and Florencia de Mora, staying as discontinuous integrated zone districts "Víctor Larco Herrera" and "La Esperanza" for 1981 the city already had 403.337 inhabitants. Also from the 1980 projects are promoted as Trujillo Industrial Park, located on the north side of town, in the present La Esperanza district. With the advent of the 1990s, joined the city of Trujillo continued the districts of La Esperanza and Victor Larco Herrera and horizontal growth of the city, resulted in the districts of Moche, Trujillo, Salaverry, Laredo and become part of the area integrated batch of the city. He went to the first half of the decade of 1990, with the emergence of the town center "El Milagro" in Huanchaco, joined to La Esperanza district, and increasing interdependence with the districts of Moche and Laredo, which was cemented Trujillo as the new metropolis of Peru, telling then with a population of 589.314 inhabitants. The latter half of the 20th century saw the expansion of the city due to a combination of rural-urban migration and the consolidation of surrounding districts into the Trujillo metropolitan area. The month of July 1932 saw Trujillo once again at the centre of one of the most important episodes in the history of the Republic of Peru, the "Trujillo Revolution of 1932", which cost the lives of many citizens. Although this year came to be known as the "Year of barbarism", it would also mark the political identity of the city during the second half of the 20th century. With the experience of the last two decades of the 20th century when the city experienced an excessive disordered growth while, mostly horizontal, increasing the costs for providing basic services to the population, the Provincial Municipality of Trujillo created the "Plan Trujillo Metropolitan Development&nbsp;– 2010 ", known as" PLANDEMETRU ", approved by city Ordinance No. 05-95-MPT on November 30, 1995, through which is planned growth and development of the city by 2010 and now the lines of development of the metropolis is governed by the "Strategic Plan for Integral Development and Sustainable Trujillo to 2015" containing general guidelines for the development of the city for year 2015.  In November 2010, Trujillo was the first city in Latin America and the Caribbean to be chosen by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to develop the pilot project Trujillo: Sustainable City in the platform "Emerging and Sustainable Cities of the Inter-American Development Bank". This project includes plan of action on climate change, which will be held on emissions inventory provides Trujillo, review the list of investment projects and introduce them variable climate. According to Fidel Jaramillo, representative of the Inter-American Development Bank, (IDB) chose this city as the first driver in Latin America to develop a new initiative. Trujillo's plan to conceive from other perspectives such as fiscal and financial sustainability, which is basic, but also from environmental sustainability and quality of life. The IDB is developing relevant projects in coordination with the Provincial Municipality of Trujillo. Trujillo city in 2012 has begun to develop, with the support of IBM company, the project called "Smart City" that will try to focus technologically two problems in Trujillo as public safety and transportation. Trujillo is located at an altitude of 34 meters on a coastal strip west of the province of Trujillo, in the old valley of "Chimor" today known as the Moche or Santa Catalina Valley. Its main square is located at 8 ° 6 '3 " South latitude ; to 79 ° 1' 34" west longitude at an altitude of 31.16 meters above sea level and lies 4.40&nbsp;km of the Pacific Ocean, in a straight line along Larco Avenue. This city has a mild desert climate (BWh or BWn, according to the Köppen climate classification) and it is known as La Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera (The city of the everlasting spring), because of its sunny and pleasant weather year-round. The International Spring Festival in early October attracts visitors from all over Peru and the world; is a land of mild climate and low rainfall, with moderate temperatures ranging between 14 ° and 30&nbsp;°C due to the Humboldt Current. Trujillo has a warm climate in summer days and cool and pleasant during the night by the sea breeze effect. It has an average temperature of 18&nbsp;°C, and the extreme minimum and maximum temperatures fluctuate around 17&nbsp;°C and 28&nbsp;°C in summer, respectively. Presents rains are light, sporadic and occur during the afternoon or evening. In the area of Trujillo, the Andes and its foothills are very close to the coast, and having lower elevation relative to the Andes Mountains of central and southern Peru, encourage the flow of moist air from the region the Amazon, which converges with the breezes of the west side, favoring the summer season a higher frequency of light showers. According to climate classification of Thornthwaite, city of Trujillo would correspond to an arid climate type, semi and humid with no rain during all seasons.Senamhi,Guía Climática Turística-Perú http://www.senamhi.gob.pe/?p=0702 However, Trujillo maintains a mild climate and warm with temperatures around 19&nbsp;°C for most of the year, which Trujillo is internationally known as City of Eternal Spring. The part closest to the sea presented naturally, haze during the morning and usually, the temperature is lower than in the central and upper parts of the city. However, when it presents the phenomenon of El Niño, the climate varies, mainly rainfall, with less intensity than in regions located north of the city, and the temperature can also be lifted. In the summer months: in mid-December, January, February, March and mid April, recorded maximum temperatures averaging 22&nbsp;°C, 23&nbsp;°C, 25&nbsp;°C, 25&nbsp;°C and 23&nbsp;°C respectively and recorded temperatures average minimum of 18&nbsp;°C, 19&nbsp;°C, 21&nbsp;°C, 20&nbsp;°C and 19&nbsp;°C respectively and with some rain at night. In other months, are recorded average temperatures between 20&nbsp;°C and 17&nbsp;°C. Between June and September, its countryside are moistened by mild drizzle and it’s recorded the minimum temperature of 7&nbsp;°C. Trujillo is crossed by the Moche river that passes by southern part of the city, its waters have been used since ancient times by the Mochicas and Chimus who inhabited this area, those who took its waters to irrigate their fields; today the river is part of the Countryside of Moche and waters continue to be used in it. The river empties into the Pacific Ocean right on the boundary between the districts of Moche and Victor Larco Herrera. Trujillo is set on a coastal plain of the La Libertad Region and has a gentle topography so its terrain is very hilly, it sits on a plateau of the Trujillo Province. The low-lying areas of the city are very close to the Pacific Ocean and the higher elevations are close to the Andean foothills that occur in the area. About  the spatial distribution of the population of the city and the urban continuum of Trujillo in 2007, there are two positions: According to the report "Sociodemographic Profile" issued by the INEI In 2007, the city had a population of up to 682,834 people, with an annual average growth rate of 2.1%; According to the report "Peru: Recent Internal Migration and Cities System 2001&nbsp;– 2007", in 2007 the figure was 709,566 inhabitants. Moreover, considering  the studies of urban development of the "PLANDET", the city is formed by the five districts that make up the conurbation of the districts of Trujillo, La Esperanza, El Porvenir, Florencia de Mora and Victor Larco Herrera in addition these also the minor municipality called "El Milagro" in the jurisdiction of Huanchaco district, which make up the urban continuum of Trujillo city; and the urban area known as "Trujillo Metropolitano" comprises the urban continuum and the urban and rural towns of the districts of the metropolitan area including such as are Huanchaco, Laredo, Moche and Salaverry. In recent decades, urban growth is largely due to Trujillo population increase of migrant origin, the main contributors of population (1993 census), the interior provinces of La Libertad as Otuzco (15.8%), Santiago de Chuco (9.3%), Ascope (9%) and Sánchez Carrión (5.2%), while 16% contributed Cajamarca and Ancash with 5%; A comparison Chart of the city and metropolitan population of Trujillo, in the bars in green color It is shown the evolution of the population of the city and the blue bars show the population of Trujillo metropolitan. According to INEI in 2014 Trujillo metropolitan has a population of with 935.147 people is Peru's second largest metropolis by population. In the city the predominant religion is Christianity, inherited from the Spanish culture since colonial era. In this topic there are different congregations that profess the Christian faith as the Catholic Church, Jehovah's Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Pentecostal Church, etc. All these Christian congregations have their temples in different parts of the city. In the historical center of Trujillo dominates the existence of temples of the Catholic Church such as the cathedral city located in the Plaza de Armas of Trujillo. One of the most representative events of Christianity in the city organized by the Catholic Church each year is Corpus Christi which gathers a large number of Christians in the Plaza Mayor of the city. About the Catholicism is the predominant Church in the districts that make up the city, according to census data in 2007. In the city, 76.9% of the population over 12 years is Catholic, 15.1% is Protestant, 3.9% other churches, and 4.1% is not linked to any church of a universe of 541,056 people.   In the 19th century, the city of Trujillo greatly expanded due to extensive irrigated agriculture, with high production and profits from the sugarcane industry. Today, asparagus and shoes are some of the main products of its metropolitan area. The irrigated lands of the Moche River Valley produce sugarcane, rice, and asparagus. Industries in the city include the sugar refineries, knitting mills, breweries and the shoe industry. Among the internationally known products of Trujillo, asparagus is exported to neighboring countries, Europe and the United States. The areas around Trujillo are among the largest exporters of white asparagus in the world. Peru is the world’s leading exporter of asparagus, followed by China and Mexico. Trujillo is the most important economic center of northern Peru; it is an inland commercial and transport center for the surrounding farming areas. Its numerous shopping malls, supermarkets, department stores, and similar amenities make Trujillo a modern city. In recent years another important economic sector in the city is the construction industry. According to statistical information provided by the "Institute of Construction and Development of the Peruvian Chamber of Construction" between 2006 and May 2012 construction activity in Trujillo grew by 500%. The study reveals that in 2006 were built 92770 m2 and the first months of 2012 the figure rose to 437440 m2, mainly due to the increased amount of square meters per house, likewise states that the total built in so far this year, 84% is housing construction. Trujillo is an agricultural, commercial and transport center due to production areas that account. The expansion of irrigated agriculture caused an expansive growth in the city, especially agribusiness sugar cane, which had as its ultimate expression in the Agricultural Cooperative Sugar Casa Grande (Casa Grande today Agroindustirial Company SA). Among its most popular products internationally, highlighting the studs that are exported mainly to neighboring countries, USA, Europe. The momentum that has been taking the "Special Project Chavimochic" which includes the irrigation of the valleys of Chao, Viru, Moche, and later will include Chicama, has managed the successful export of many agricultural and agroindustrial products, which include artichokes, peppers, avocado, mango, etc. Chavimochic Special Project is a work of  hydraulic engineering, this irrigation system extends throughout much of the coast of the La Libertad Region, on the north coast of Peru, it is designed to irrigate the valleys of Chao, Viru, Moche and Chicama. In 2012 It is already advanced up to its second stage in Moche valley. It consists of the shoe makers and other leather products. It is classified within the manufacturing sector and is composed of micro and small enterprises, characterized by abundant labor demand and intermediate goods. Formally registered in 1300 small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which provide a significant 11% to the sector. They have achieved to sell their products domestically and characterize Trujillo as a shoe manufacturer city . Has the distinction of having formed a business cluster that provides its own dynamic of production and marketing. Spatially, 53% of SMEs are located in the district of El Porvenir. Trujillo concentrates 24% of the activity, and finally La Esperanza and Florencia de Mora concentrated 10% each. Tanning SMEs are preferentially located in the bottom of La Esperanza. The city has the largest commercial activity in the region motivated mainly by agribusiness, footwear industry, metal engineering, education, etc. Some of the main retail centers in the city are: According to a study published in 2010 by the magazine Peru Económico some of the most representative brands of Trujillo and that have regional impact are: Trujillo is the capital of La Libertad region as such is the seat of regional government and its technical organs of government line as are the regional offices of the scope of its jurisdiction, so the regional policies of this government are deployed from this city for use in its territory corresponding. The city also hosts various regional directorates of the ministries that make up the country's public administration. Trujillo is also headquarters of the III-Territorial Police Directorate, as executing agency for the National Police of Peru. The city, capital of La Libertad Region and the Province of Trujillo, is governed by the Provincial Municipality of Trujillo, which is governed by the provisions of the organic law of municipalities and that it has jurisdiction throughout the province . There is limited authority to the city and there is no governing body of the city itself, in that sense, the municipalities of the metropolitan districts that make up the city have jurisdiction in matters relating to their own districts. The city is governed by a provincial mayor elected by popular vote every four years. The mayor is responsible for the municipal public administration and community, is the political representative of the municipality of the city and has political influences at the provincial level, so the guidelines of their policies are aimed primarily at the territorial level. Trujillo is home to the Superior Court of La Libertad, that was the first Superior Court of Justice established in the country during the government of Simon Bolivar on March 26, 1824 under the name of Superior Court of North. Is the governing body of the Judicial District of La Libertad. According to Peru's judicial system. The city has the highest judicial burden of the region La Libertad.   Tourism is a major industry in Trujillo due to the city's proximity to important sites where the Moche and Chimu civilizations evolved. These civilizations had highly skilled artisans, and many of their artifacts having been found during archaeological digs in the city. Nearby ruins include the Chimu adobe city of Chan Chan, the world's largest city built from that material. It is sometimes called Ciudad de la Luna (City of the Moon) because the people worshipped the moon; or de las Largas Murallas (of the Long Walls). In size and complexity, it has been compared with Teotihuacan in Mexico, and the ancient cities of Egypt. Other nearby ruins are the Moche ruins of Huaca del Sol, Huaca de la Luna, Huaca del Dragón o Arco Iris, Huaca Esmeralda and El Brujo. Trujillo aspires to be designated a World Heritage Site, because of the proximity of both cultures and its historical colonial city centre, whose historic casonas (mansions) attract many visitors. The mansions and manors of Trujillo are distinguished for their solemn and austere façades. Inside, their halls are overflowing with ornaments.
