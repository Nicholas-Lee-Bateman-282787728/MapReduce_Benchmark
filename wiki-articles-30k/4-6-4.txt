   Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, usually in a leading truck, six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles, and four trailing wheels on two axles, usually in a trailing truck. In France, where the type was first used, it is known as the Baltic, while it became known as the Hudson in most of North America.Railway Technical Web Pages (Steam Locomotive Glossary) Other equivalent classifications are: The  tender locomotive was first introduced in 1911 and throughout the 1920s, '30s and '40s, the wheel arrangement was widely used in North America and to a lesser extent in the rest of the world. The type combined the basic design principles of the  Pacific type with an improved boiler and larger firebox that necessitated additional support at the rear of the locomotive. In general, the available tractive effort differed little from that of the Pacific, but the steam-raising ability was increased, giving more power at speed. The  was best suited to high-speed running across flat terrain. Since the type had fewer driving wheels than carrying wheels, a smaller percentage of the locomotive's weight contributed to traction, compared to other types. Like the Pacific, it was well suited for high speed passenger trains, but not for starting heavy freight trains and slogging on long sustained grades, where more pairs of driving wheels are better. The first  tender locomotive in the world was a four-cylinder compound locomotive, designed by Gaston du Bousquet for the Chemin de Fer du Nord in France in 1911. Since it was designed for the Paris-Saint Petersburg express, it was named the "Baltic" after the Baltic Sea, which was a logical extension of the naming convention that started with the  Atlantic and  Pacific.Reed, Brian. (1972). Loco Profile, Nord Pacifics. Windsor: Profile Publications. The first  in the United States of America, the J-1 of the New York Central Railroad, was built in 1927 to the railroad’s design by the American Locomotive Company (Alco). There the type was named the "Hudson" after the Hudson River.4-6-4 "Hudson" Type Locomotives The world speed record for steam locomotives was held by a  at least twice. In 1934 the Milwaukee Road’s class F6 No. 6402 reached , and in 1936 the German class 05.002 reached . That record was broken by the British  Pacific No. 4468 "Mallard" on 3 July 1938, when it reached , still the world speed record for steam traction.DB Museum in Nuremberg - Germany’s fastest steam locomotive The  was also a fairly common wheel arrangement for passenger tank locomotives. As such it was essentially the tank locomotive equivalent of a  tender locomotive, with water tanks and a coal bunker supported by four trailing wheels instead of in a tender. In New Zealand, all 4-6-4T locomotives were tank versions of 4-6-2 locomotives. The first known  tank locomotive was rebuilt from a Natal Government Railways (NGR) K&S Class , that was modified in 1896 to enable it to run equally well in either direction on the Natal South Coast line, where no turntables were available at the time. This sole locomotive later became the Class C2 on the South African Railways (SAR). The first known locomotive class to be designed with a  wheel arrangement, the NGR’s Class F tank locomotive, was based on this modified locomotive and built by Neilson, Reid and Company in 1902. These became the Class E on the SAR in 1912.  Seventy R class  Hudson tender locomotives, the only class of this configuration in Australia and built by North British Locomotive Company, were introduced by the Victorian Railways in 1951 for mainline express passenger operations. However, the introduction in 1952 of the B class diesel-electric locomotives saw the R class almost immediately being relegated to secondary passenger and freight use, with many being staged at depots around the state. A number were preserved and some of these continued to operate on special excursion trains.  With the privatisation of regional passenger operations in Victoria in the mid-1990s, two R class locomotives were brought back into normal revenue service by the West Coast Railway, for regularly scheduled mainline passenger trains between Melbourne and Warrnambool. The locomotives underwent a number of modifications to allow for reliable high speed operation, including dual Lempor exhausts, oil firing and the addition of a diesel control stand for multiple unit operation. The use of these R class locomotives on the Warrnambool line did not continue after the demise of the private operator in 2004.West Coast Railway Modernised R Class Locomotives R711 & R766Anatomy of West Coast Railway's "Super" R Class, Introduced and compiled by Barry Merton The  tank locomotive configuration was a popular type with the Western Australian Government Railways. The D class was introduced for suburban passenger service in 1912. Its successors, both also of the  wheel arrangement, were the Dm class of 1945 that was rebuilt from older E class  Pacific tender locomotives, and the Dd class of 1946. The N.S.W. Government Railways 30 class 4-6-4 Tank Locomotives were used on Sydney and Newcastle suburban passenger train workings.  3046 is preserved at the Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum on the N.S.W. north coast.  The second-largest user of the  type in North America was the Canadian Pacific Railway  with sixty-five H1a to H1e class locomotives, numbered 2800 to 2864 and built by Montreal Locomotive Works  between 1929 and 1940. They were highly successful and improved service and journey times on the CPR's transcontinental routes. The third and later batches of CPR Hudsons, H1c to H1e numbers 2820 to 2864, were dubbed Royal Hudsons and were semi-streamlined. Royal permission was given for these locomotives to bear the royal crown and arms after locomotive No. 2850 hauled King George VI across Canada in 1939. Five CPR Hudsons survived. H1b class no. 2816 "Empress" is the sole remaining unstreamlined CPR Hudson. It was repatriated from static display at Steamtown in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to the CPR in 1998 and was restored and converted to oil-burning to haul excursions for CPR. The other remaining H1 class locomotives are all Royal Hudsons. As of 2008 three were on display in museums, No. 2839 in California, No. 2850 in Quebec and No. 2858 in Ontario, while no. 2860, the first oil-burning Royal Hudson of the class, was operational and based in British Columbia. By 2008 the CPR Hudsons were the only operational Hudsons in North America.CP2816 - Rebirth of a mechanical Wonder. (CPR News, Number 2, 2001) (Also see ) The Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) had six K2 class  locomotives, built in September 1914 by MLW and acquired for suburban service. Numbered 1540 to 1545 on the GTR, they were reclassified as X-10-a and renumbered 45 to 50 after being absorbed by the Canadian National Railway (CN) in 1923. Three of them are preserved, numbers GT 1541 (CN 46) and GT 1542 (CN 47) at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and GT 1544 (CN 49) at the Canadian Railway Museum in Delson, Quebec. (Also see )  The Finnish State Railways Class Pr2, nicknamed "Henschel", was a  gauge passenger tank locomotive class, ordered from Henschel & Son by the Estonian State Railways in the spring of 1939 and completed in 1941. The outbreak of the Second World War prevented their delivery to Estonia, but a few of these engines did operate in Latvia in 1942. They became superfluous when the Germans began converting the Baltic tracks to , and the four locomotives were sold to Finland. They were classified Pr2 and numbered 1800 to 1803 upon their arrival in Finland in December 1942.Pölhö, Eljas; Pykälä-Aho, Mia (1996). Suomen juna- ja raitiovaunukuvasto (Finnish Motive Power). ISBN 91-7266-133-X The Class Pr2 tanks were quite advanced locomotives and were based on the Henschel-built DRG Class 62 tank engine design of 1928 for the Deutsche Reichsbahn. After their initial teething problems were solved, they proved to be fast runners and an ideal addition to the motive power stable. They were originally built as oil-burners and reverted to this type of fuel between 1947 and 1954, when oil prices were low. With its  driving wheels, it was very fast and one of them achieved  during a test run. No. 1803, the last Class Pr2 in service, was withdrawn in May 1960. Only no. 1800 has been preserved.Sakari K. Salo (2009): Höyryveturikirja, s. 14. Helsinki: Kustantaja Laaksonen. ISBN 978-952-5805-12-3 The four-cylinder  compound locomotive designed by Gaston du Bousquet for the French Chemin de Fer du Nord, of which two were built at the company's workshops in 1911, was the first tender locomotive in the world with this wheel arrangement. Named the Baltic since it was intended for service on the Paris-Saint Petersburg express, its most remarkable feature was the en echelon arrangement of the two low-pressure inside cylinders in order to accommodate the very large bore. One of them was built with an arch-tube firebox. Although they were not multiplied, they were the forerunners of the highly successful  Nord Pacifics and Super-Pacifics. One survives in the Musée français du chemin de fer (French national railway museum) at Mulhouse in eastern France, cut up in sectioned form to display its interior during the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937. Its tender was not preserved.The Railfaneurope.net Picture Gallery  France also produced some of the last Baltic locomotives. In 1938 Marc de Caso, the last Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Nord, originated the construction of eight Baltic locomotives, all delivered to the newly established Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français (French National Railway Corporation or SNCF). Of these eight, three were 232.R class three-cylinder simplex locomotives with rotary cam poppet valve gear, while four were 232.S class four-cylinder compound locomotives, initially also with poppet valve gear that was later replaced by Walschaerts valve gear driving oscillating cams. Built for comparative purposes, it was found that the compounds outperformed the simples. The eighth of the class, the final French Baltic type, was completed in 1949 as the 232.U.1 class. This was another four-cylinder compound with Walschaerts valve gear, but with very large and light piston valves, that proved capable of more than . This locomotive is also preserved at Mulhouse.Ransome Wallis (ed). Concise Encyclopedia of World Railway LocomotivesChapelon, Andre. La Locomotive a Vapeur (Also see )  Three  tender locomotives were built for the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) by Borsig in 1935. Classified as Class 05, they were designed for high speed running. They were three-cylinder locomotives with giant  driving wheels and powerful clasp brakes on all wheels. The first two locomotives were conventional locomotives, but the third was built as a cab forward and burned pulverised coal. All three were built streamlined, in shrouds that covered the locomotives almost to the railhead. On 11 May 1936 the 05.002 set a world speed record of , that was bettered by the British  Pacific "Mallard" two years later, on 3 July 1938. All three survived World War II and were rebuilt as conventional non-streamlined locomotives in 1950, with new boilers. They worked in this form until 1957, when electric locomotives took over on the high-speed routes. The first locomotive, 05.001, was restored to its original streamlined configuration in 1961, for display in the Nuremberg Transport Museum. A number of German  tank locomotive classes were built, the best known being the Prussian T 18 class of 1912. Altogether 534 of them were built by the Stettiner Maschinenbau AG Vulcan and Henschel & Son between 1912 and 1927. Of these, 458 went to the Prussian state railways and subsequently the Deutsche Reichsbahn, where they became the DRG Class 78.Ebel, Jürgen-Ulrich; Knipping, Andreas; Wenzel, Hansjürgen (1990).

In: LOK MAGAZIN, Nr. 265/Jahrgang 42/2003. GeraNova Zeitschriftenverlag GmbH München, S. 50-60. ISSN 0458-1822 There were two classes of  tender locomotives in India, both early in the history of the wheel arrangement and also of unusually narrow gauge. The nine G class locomotives of the  gauge Barsi Light Railway in western India were built by Nasmyth, Wilson and Company in 1928 and 1930 and by W. G. Bagnall in 1939. The four ND class locomotives of the  gauge Scindia State Railway in Gwalior were built in 1928 by Kerr, Stuart and Company.  The Indonesian C27 class locomotive of the Java Staatsspoorwegen was introduced to Java by the Netherlands colonial administration. The class was designed to meet the requirement to haul trains of 400 tons at a speed of  on a  incline with  radius curves. The locomotives also had to be able to negotiate curves with a sharp radius of  at a speed of . Between 1916 and 1922 altogether thirty-nine locomotives were ordered from three manufacturers, Werkspoor, Armstrong Whitworth and Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works. The C27 class was used on railway lines around Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya until electrification was carried out around Jakarta between 1925 and 1930. They were then relocated to secondary lines like the Merak-Tanah Abang in Banten province, the lines around Kertosono and Blitar and also between Purwokerto, Kutoarjo and Purworejo.  From 1921 fifty-eight C28 class express passenger  tank locomotives were built for the Java Staatsspoorwegen by three German manufacturers, Henschel & Son, Sächsische Maschinenfabrik and Maschinenfabrik Esslingen.Henschel-Lieferliste (Henschel & Son works list), compiled by Dietmar Stresow The C28 class was one of the most popular in Indonesia, achieving speeds of up to . It was declared the world's fastest steam locomotive on  when it achieved . In addition, being a tank locomotive, it was able to travel at full speed in both directions.  It was used on the Jakarta-Bandung, Jakarta-Surabaya and Malang-Surabaya routes. During the Dutch colonial era, the term Vlugge Vier (Fast Four) was used on the Jakarta-Bandung route, where C28 class locomotives covered the distance of  four times a day at a speed of  with a travel time of about 2 hours 45 minutes. These express trains only stopped for one minute at Karawang, Cikampek and Purwakarta. In addition, the C28 class locomotive was used on express trains like the Java Nacht Express (Java Night Express) and the Eendaagsche Express (One Day Express). A C28 class locomotive also hauled the train carrying President Sukarno and his entourage to Yogyakarta on 3 January 1948.  The first and longest-lived were two locomotives, built by Nasmyth, Wilson in 1904 for the narrow-gauge County Donegal Railways. Both were later superheated and one lasted until 1967, albeit derelict.Patterson, Edward M, The County Donegal Railways  Between 1947 and 1961 the Japanese National Railways built three classes of rather advanced American style  gauge Hudson tender locomotives.  The Class C60 and Class C61 were smaller locomotives than the Class C62, which filled the tight Japanese loading gauge. They were equipped with Boxpok driving wheels and used several American-style appliances, even though they had British-style smokebox doors. The Dutch Railways ordered six  tank passenger locomotives from Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1913. A follow-up order for thirty-four locomotives was only partly delivered when, due to the downturn in traffic caused by World War I, the Dutch authorities cancelled the remainder of the order. The forty locomotives as ordered were originally to be numbered 1201 to 1240, but the twenty-six that were delivered were later renumbered 6001 to 6026. The fourteen undelivered locomotives were sold to the British War Department for use on the Western Front, where air-braked passenger locomotives were in short supply. They were assigned Railway Operating Division (ROD) numbers 1 to 12, 14 and 15 and were used on ambulance and troop trains as well as civilian passenger trains in the British sector. After the war they were sold to the Chemin de Fer du Nord in France, who numbered them 3.871 to 3.884. In 1938 all fourteen passed on to the SNCF, who renumbered them 232.TB.1 to 232.TB.14. Two were withdrawn in 1946, but the rest remained in service until 1950-1951. They were outlived by their Dutch sister locomotives, of which twenty were still in service in 1952. (Also see ) There were also ten four-cylinder 6100 class locomotives, built in 1929 by Hohenzollern and Werkspoor and based on the 3700 4-6-0 class. The last two were retired in 1958. No  tender locomotives saw service in South Africa, but six  tank locomotive classes were used, all of them on .  In 1896 the Natal Government Railways (NGR) rebuilt one of its Class K&S 4-6-0T tank locomotives to a  configuration, as directed by NGR Locomotive Superintendent W. Milne. This was the first known use of this wheel arrangement and was done to enable the locomotive to run equally well in either direction in shuttle service on the Natal South Coast line, where no turntables were available. In 1912, when it was assimilated into the South African Railways (SAR), this locomotive was designated Class C2. Ten tank locomotives, designed by NGR Locomotive Superintendent G.W. Reid, were built for the NGR by Neilson, Reid and Company in 1902. It was the first known locomotive in the world to be designed and built as a  Baltic type. Known as the Neilson, Reid locomotives until they were designated the NGR's Class F, they were larger versions of the rebuilt Class H locomotive of 1896 and many of the main dimensions were identical. It had a plate frame, Stephenson valve gear and used saturated steam. In 1912 they became the Class E on the SAR.  Eight Class F tank locomotives were placed in service on the Central South African Railways (CSAR) in 1904, designed by CSAR Chief Locomotive Superintendent P.A. Hyde and built by Vulcan Foundry. It had a bar frame, Stephenson valve gear and used saturated steam, and was acquired for the suburban services between Springs and Randfontein. The double red lining on their black livery and polished copper-capped chimneys, brass domes and boiler bands earned them the nickname "Chocolate Boxes". These locomotives retained their Class F classification on the SAR. In 1905 two CSAR Rack tank locomotives were built for the CSAR by Vulcan Foundry, for use on the steep rack section between Waterval Onder and Waterval Boven on the line to Mozambique. Designed as two-cylinder locomotives by Hyde, the design was modified by the builders to four cylinders with the inside cylinders driving the rack equipment, but without a compensating increase in boiler capacity. The locomotives were failures on the rack section, their rack equipment was removed within a year of entering service and they were reassigned to shunting duty. In 1912 they were considered obsolete by the SAR and not classified, but they remained in service until 1915.  Seven Class K tank locomotives that had been built for the Manila Railway Company in the Philippine Islands by the North British Locomotive Company (NBL) in 1914, were sold to the SAR in 1917 since delivering them to the Philippines during World War I became impossible. They were superheated, had Walschaerts valve gear and were the first locomotives in South Africa to be equipped with exhaust steam injectors, which were of the Davies and Metcalfe pattern. Nicknamed "Manila", they remained in service until 1938. Six Class J tank locomotives, designed by SAR Chief Mechanical Engineer D.A. Hendrie and built by Nasmyth, Wilson and Company, were introduced on the SAR in 1915. They had Walschaerts valve gear and Belpaire fireboxes and used saturated steam. Acquired to cope with increasing traffic on the Natal South Coast, but unable to handle the rapidly increasing loads due to their small proportions, they soon ended up being employed as shunters in the Durban harbour, at Mossel Bay and in the Cape Midlands, until they were withdrawn from service by 1957.  Only three prototype Hudson locomotives were built in the former Soviet Union in 1937 and 1938. They were all streamlined and were the only streamlined series of Soviet steam locomotives, although a later post-war P36 series  Northern locomotive was semi-streamlined. All three were scrapped in the 1950s.   The only  tender locomotive in the United Kingdom was the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) no. 10000, built in 1930 as an experimental high-pressure compound locomotive with an experimental high-pressure water-tube boiler. It was the only locomotive of the Class W1 and became known as the "hush-hush locomotive" on account of the great secrecy under which it was built. Its trailing wheels were arranged uniquely. Instead of being in one four-wheel trailing truck, the first pair was a Cartazzi axle, mounted in a rigid frame but still allowed sideways deflection against a centering force, as typical of the LNER’s practice on its Pacific locomotives. The second pair was in a two-wheel trailing truck. The experiment proved much less successful than had been hoped and in 1936 it was rebuilt along the lines of a streamlined LNER Class A4 Pacific, though it retained its Baltic wheel arrangement. After being rebuilt, the Class W1 was still easily distinguishable from an A4 at a glance, without looking for the extra trailing wheels, by the fact that it was never officially named even though the name "Pegasus" had been proposed. It therefore became known among train spotters as the "No-name Streak".Cox, Stewart, Locomotive Panorama Vol 1 A number of  tank locomotives were built for various British railway companies. The first standard-gauge examples were Robert Whitelegg’s design in 1912 for the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&SR). They were only delivered after the LT&SR had been taken over by the Midland Railway, where they were designated the 2100 class. Between 1914 and 1922 the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) built seven L class tank locomotives, known as the "Brighton Baltics". The first examples suffered from instability problems until they were rebuilt with well-tanks. These high-speed tank locomotives hauled the famous "Brighton Belle" train until the electrification of the Brighton Main Line in 1933, after which they were converted into N15X class  tender locomotives. They remained in service until 1957.Bradley, D.L., Locomotives of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (RCTS) Vol 3 The Glasgow and South Western Railway and a number of other railways also had tank locomotive classes of this wheel arrangement.   The first Hudson locomotive in North America was built in 1927 for the New York Central Railroad (NYC) by American Locomotive Company (Alco), to the railroad's design. The locomotive proved to be very successful and was named the Hudson type, after the Hudson River. Thirteen of these locomotives, one J-1 type and twelve J-3a types, were streamlined for use with named passenger trains like the "Empire State Express" and the "20th Century Limited". Between the NYC and its subsidiaries, the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&A), the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (CCC&StL or "Big Four") and the Michigan Central Railroad (MC), they acquired altogether 275  locomotives of several different types, the largest Hudson fleet in North America. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) could have produced the first American  since its design work was done earlier than that of the NYC, but financial constraints delayed the project and the Milwaukee's locomotives only emerged in 1930. The Milwaukee called them Baltic, following the European practice started in France. The initial order of fourteen Class F6 locomotives was followed by eight more Class F6a locomotives in 1931, and in 1938 the Milwaukee acquired six streamlined Class F7 Baltics, with the shrouds . These took over the Milwaukee's crack "Hiawatha" express trains from the Class A  Atlantics and were among the fastest steam locomotives of all time. The schedules of many of these trains required extended running at . In addition to the Milwaukee’s streamlined Class F7, two other railroads ordered larger and faster  locomotives with  drivers in the late 1930s. These were the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe) with its 3460 Class and the Chicago and North Western (CNW) with its Class E-4. The Milwaukee and CNW locomotives were all streamlined, and only one of the Santa Fe locomotives, the 3460 "Blue Goose".  In 1937 the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (Burlington Route) needed backup locomotives for their streamlined diesel-hauled "Zephyr" passenger trains. Their solution was to streamline their Baldwin-built no. 3002 in their main Iowa shops. The locomotive was renumbered as no. 4000 and given the name "Aeolus", after the mythical keeper of the winds. A second streamlined  was built for this purpose and numbered 4001. There were also some one-off and experimental  locomotives. A number were rebuilt from  Pacific locomotives, or in some cases from other designs. Twenty-one railroads in North America owned s. Many were similar in concept to the NYC Hudsons, with  driving wheels, but most were a little larger than the NYC locomotives, such as the F6 and F6a classes of the Milwaukee Road, the  class of the Canadian National, the Canadian Pacific locomotives, the  class of the Burlington Route, the  class of the New Haven and the 1151 class of the Lackawanna. There were also the lightweights, which include the  class of the Nickel Plate Road, the class D of the Maine Central and the class  of the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México (N de M). On these the extra axle was used to reduce the axle load in comparison to a  Pacific locomotive. Because the  design was really only optimally suited to express passenger trains which were dieselised early, the Hudsons were early candidates for withdrawal and scrapping. None of the NYC locomotives survives and neither does any of the Milwaukee locomotives. Five Canadian Pacific Hudsons survive, including four Royal Hudsons and the un-streamlined Canadian Pacific 2816. Five of the Burlington Route locomotives survive, including the "Aeolus". Other surviving Hudson locomotives are two each of the Santa Fe and Canadian National, and single examples from the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, N de M and Nickel Plate Road.

The Class C61 was the first Japanese locomotive with the  Hudson wheel arrangement. In 1948 and 1949 forty-nine Class C62 locomotives were built with new 4-6-4 frames and using the boilers of Class D52  Mikado locomotives. These were the largest and fastest steam passenger locomotives to run in Japan. Between 1953 and 1961 forty-seven Class C60 locomotives were rebuilt from surplus Class C59  Pacific locomotives at the Hamamatsu and Kōriyama factories. In 1937 two were built by the Kolomna Locomotive Works. These were known as the 2-3-2K locomotives, designed by Lev Lebedyanskii and rated at . Designated the P12 series, they were used to haul the "Red Arrow" passenger train between Moscow and Leningrad. The intention was to build up to ten 2-3-2K locomotives to haul all express passenger trains between Moscow and Leningrad, but these plans were interrupted by World War II and not resumed.  Another one was built in Voroshilovgrad in 1938, known as the 2-3-2V experimental locomotive number 6998. This locomotive was never used on mainline service.  The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway examples were very rare in having four cylinders. Known as the "Dreadnought Tanks", they proved to be too large and too complex for the duties they performed. The saturated steam tank locomotives of the Belfast and County Down Railway were spectacularly unsuccessful because of poor valve settings. On the other hand the Furness Railway tank locomotives, also using saturated steam and with inside cylinders, were very popular with their crews.Fryer, C.E.J.,British Baltic Tanks The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) built four as experimental locomotives between 1933 and 1936, using Colonel Emerson’s water-tube fireboxes, but eventually turned to diesel-electric traction instead.Sagle, Laurence, B&O Power In 1937 the Illinois Central Railroad (IC) rebuilt a 2-8-4 Berkshire into its only Hudson, the Illinois Central No. 1, which was not a success and was not repeated. The Wabash Railroad rebuilt its seven Class P1 Hudsons from their unsuccessful K-4 and K5 Class 2-8-2 Mikado locomotives.
