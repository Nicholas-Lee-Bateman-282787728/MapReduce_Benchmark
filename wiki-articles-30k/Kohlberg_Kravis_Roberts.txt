   KKR & Co. L.P. (formerly known as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.) is an American multinational private equity firm, specializing in leveraged buyouts, headquartered in New York. The firm sponsors and manages private equity investment funds. A pioneer in the leveraged buyout industry, the firm has completed over $400 billion of private equity transactions since its inception. The firm was founded in 1976 by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, all of whom had previously worked together at Bear Stearns, where they completed some of the earliest leveraged buyout transactions. Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of landmark transactions including the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date."What's An Aging 'Barbarian' To Do?"

KKR invests primarily through leveraged buyouts as well as growth capital investments (including "PIPE" investments in public companies). It has traditionally specialized in private equity investments, focusing on specific industry sectors where the firm has created nine dedicated investment groups. The industries in which KKR has developed a specialization include:2007 KKR Annual Review; retrieved February 16, 2009. The professionals in each of KKR's industry-focused groups are expected to have developed a proficiency in their respective industries. The firm has traditionally had strong ties with its investors."Canada Pension Plan Unit to Join K.K.R. Merchant Banking Venture", New York Times (Dealbook Section), January 17, 2013. KKR has historically relied primarily on private equity funds, pools of committed capital that are raised from a broad array of institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, investment banks, commercial banks, endowments, fund of funds, high-net-worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds). As of March 31, 2014, KKR had completed fund-raising for approximately 23 traditional investment funds in the US, Europe and Asia with total committed capital of approximately US$80 billion: KKR Financial () is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and specialty finance company that invests in residential and commercial mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities as well as corporate loans and debt securities, asset-backed securities and equity securities.

KKR had initially considered structuring KFN as a business development company like Apollo Management's Apollo Investment Corporation but chose to pursue the REIT structure to capitalize on the strength in REIT valuations at the time. KFN was an early casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis and in September 2007, Henry Kravis and George Roberts injected $270 million into the company. On February 20, 2008, KFN was once again forced to delay the repayment of billions of dollars of commercial paper, and began a new round of talks with creditors.KKR arm in talks after fresh repayment delays.

KKR Private Equity Investors () is a publicly traded private equity fund that invests as a fund of funds in KKR private equity funds. KPE also co-invests in transactions alongside KKR's private equity funds. KPE was founded in 2006. In May 2006, KKR raised $5 billion in an initial public offering for a KPE to serve as a new permanent investment vehicle listing it on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam. KKR raised three times more than it expected, as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds seeking exposure to private equity but could not make long term commitments to private equity funds. As private equity had been booming in preceding years, investing in a KKR fund was attractive to investors."Opening Private Equity's Door, at Least a Crack, to Public Investors".

They targeted family-owned businesses, many of which had been founded in the years following World War II which by the 1960s and 1970s were facing succession issues. Many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Company History. Funding Universe; retrieved February 16, 2009.  Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973), as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Despite a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.Burrough, Bryan. Barbarians at the Gate. New York: Harper & Row, 1990; pp. 133-136. By 1976, tensions  had built up between Bear Stearns and Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts, which led to the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities. In 1976, Kravis had been required to serve as interim CEO of a failing direct mail company named Advo.  The new KKR completed its first buyout, that of manufacturer A.J. Industries, in 1977. KKR raised capital from a small group of investors including the Hillman Company and First Chicago Bank. By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising its first institutional fund with over $30 million of investor commitments.Burrough, Bryan. Barbarians at the Gate (New York: Harper & Row, 1990), pp. 136-140. In 1981, KKR expanded its investor base significantly when the Oregon State Treasury's public pension fund invested in KKR's acquisition of retailer Fred Meyer, Inc.

KKR closed out the 1970s completing the public-to-private buyout of Houdaille Industries in 1979,, pp. 149–169. probably the largest take-private of a public company to that point. As the 1980s began, KKR was among the most prominent practitioner of leveraged buyouts and would prove the most prolific of the private equity investors in the 1980s. Among the firm's most notable acquisitions during the 1980s buyout boom were the following:  After the 1987 resignation of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded his own private equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm was responsible for the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved to be not only the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign of the end of the 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, and later made into a television movie starring James Garner."The Granddaddy Of All Takeovers", The New York Times Book Review, January 21, 1990. In 1988, F. Ross Johnson was the President and CEO of RJR Nabisco, formed in 1985 by the merger of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a leading producer of food products (Shredded Wheat, Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, Life Savers, Del Monte Fruit and Vegetables, and Snickers Chocolate) as well as Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes. In October 1988, Johnson proposed a $17 billion ($75 per share) management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton and its parent company, American Express."Nabisco Executives Offer $17 Billion for Company". The New York Times, October 21, 1988."Shearson Risks, Rewards on RJR Nabisco". The New York Times, October 22, 1988. Several days later, Kravis, who had originally suggested the idea of the buyout to Johnson, presented a new bid for $20.3 billion ($90 per share) financed with an aggressive debt package."Nabisco Bid Seen by Kohlberg". The New York Times, October 24, 1988."Buyout Specialist Bids $20.3 Billion For RJR Nabisco".

The New York Times, October 31, 1988. However, KKR faced criticism from existing investors over the firm's use of hostile tactics in the buyout of RJR."Concern Over Kohlberg, Kravis Strategy". The New York Times, November 2, 1988.

The New York Times, November 17, 1988. Ultimately the Forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for RJR."Suitors Quarrel Over RJR Nabisco". The New York Times, November 8, 1988. Many of the major banking players of the day, including Shearson Lehman Hutton, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties.  In November 1988, RJR set guidelines for a final bid submission at the end of the month.RJR Nabisco Discloses Guidelines for Its Buyout. The New York Times, November 9, 1988. The management and Shearson group submitted a final bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis and KKR. KKR's final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco."RJR Nabisco Suitor Claims $24.88 Billion Victory". The New York Times, December 1, 1988. KKR's offer was guaranteed, whereas the management offer lacked a "reset", meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated $112 per share."RJR Nabisco Explains Its Choice". The New York Times, December 8, 1988 Additionally, many in RJR's board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of Ross Johnson' unprecedented golden parachute deal."Nabisco Executives to Take Huge Gains in Their Buyout". The New York Times, November 5, 1988."A Growing Backlash Against Greed". The New York Times, November 13, 1988 Time Magazine featured Ross Johnson on the cover of their December 1988 issue along with the headline, "A Game of Greed: This man could pocket $100 million from the largest corporate takeover in history. Has the buyout craze gone too far?"."Game of Greed", Time Magazine (1988) KKR's offer was welcomed by the board, and, to some observers, it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a deal-breaker in KKR's favor was little more than an excuse to reject Ross Johnson's higher payout of $112 per share. Johnson received $53 million from the buyout."Losers Get Some Spoils In Fight for RJR Nabisco". The New York Times, December 2, 1988 KKR collected a $75 million fee in the RJR takeover."Kohlberg, Kravis to Collect $75 Million RJR Nabisco Fee". The New York Times, February 1, 1989. At $31.1 billion of transaction value (including assumed debt), RJR Nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history."RJR Nabisco, An Epilogue". The New York Times, March 12, 1999. In 2006 and 2007, a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which, for the first time, surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. The deal was first surpassed in July 2006 by the $33 billion buyout of U.S. hospital operator Hospital Corporation of America, in which KKR participated, though the RJR deal was larger, adjusted for inflation. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved. Investment bankers and lawyers who advised KKR walked away with over $1 billion in fees. Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities. Size did not, however, guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden the performance of the investment, which KKR overcame, raising a new investment fund and continuing to invest throughout the 1990s."2 Buyout Firms Build New Funds". The New York Times, November 23, 1990.  The buyout of RJR Nabisco was completed in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions."Kohlberg, Kravis Now RJR's Owner". Associated Press, April 29, 1989."History Of The RJR Nabisco Takeover". The New York Times, December 2, 1988."Is RJR Worth  $25 Billion?" The New York Times, December 2, 1988. After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first and only other year, besides 1982, with no new investment activity. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell. As the new decade began, KKR began restructuring RJR. In January 1990, it completed the sale of RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt."RJR Completes Sale of Del Monte". The New York Times, January 11, 1990. Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public offerings of stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion."Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts Loan to RJR Renegotiated". The New York Times, June 27, 1990."RJR Move Helps Lift 'Junk Bonds'". The New York Times, July 17, 1990. In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company."RJR Offers Cash and Stock for 'Junk Bonds'". The New York Times, December 18, 1990. RJR issued additional stock to the public in March 1991 to further reduce debt, resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of RJR's debt from junk to investment grade. KKR began to reduce its ownership in RJR in 1994, when its stock in RJR was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of Borden, Inc., a producer of food and beverage products, consumer products, and industrial products, in an unprecedented and complex transaction.Agrees to a Takeover. The New York Times, September 13, 1994."Kohlberg's Impetus in Borden Deal". The New York Times, September 14, 1994. "Borden Signs Agreement for Sale to Kohlberg". The New York Times, September 24, 1994."Kohlberg, Kravis Says It Has Control of Borden". The New York Times, December 22, 1994. The following year, in 1995, KKR would divest itself of its final stake in RJR Nabisco when Borden sold a $638 million block of stock."Kohlberg, Kravis Plans to Divest Remaining Stake in RJR Nabisco". The New York Times, March 16, 1995. While KKR no longer had any ownership of RJR Nabisco by 1995, its original investment would not be fully realized until KKR exited its last investment in 2004. After sixteen years of efforts, including contributing new equity, taking RJR public, asset sales and exchanging shares of RJR for the ownership of Borden, Inc., KKR finally sold the last remnants of its 1989 investment. In July 2004, KKR agreed to sell its stock in Borden Chemical to Apollo Management for  $1.2 billion."Apollo Buys Borden Chemical for $649 million". The New York Times, July 7, 2004. In the early 1990s, the absence of an active high yield market prompted KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988."Kohlberg Ends Bid for Macmillan". The New York Times, November 4, 1988. KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications,K-III's New Name To Be 'Primedia'.

The New York Times, May 23, 1989."As Primedia Falls, Preferred Stock Lives Up to Its Name". The New York Times, October 26, 2005. During the early 1990s, K-III continued acquiring publishing assets, including a $650 million acquisition from News Corporation in 1991.Kravis Rouses Itself, The New York Times, April 29, 1991 K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR continued to make new investments in the company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity."K-III Communications Files Plan For an Initial Offering of Stock". The New York Times, September 6, 1995. In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the company's stock collapsed. In 1991, KKR partnered with Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in the 1991 acquisition of the Bank of New England, from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Regulators Pick Buyer To Operate New England Bank. The New York Times, April 23, 1991. In January 1996, KKR would exchange its investment for a 7.5% interest in Fleet Bank."Kohlberg Kravis in Swap for 7.5% of Fleet".

KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable given the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point.
