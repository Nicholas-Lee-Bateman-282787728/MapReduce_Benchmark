His surname Lyall was joined with "pur" which in old Sanskrit language means city.http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=pur&script=&direction=SE&link=yes Translation of the word, Pur  In the late 1970s, the Government of Pakistan changed the name of the city from Lyallpur to "Faisalabad" (meaning City of Faisal), in honor of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, who made several financial contributions to Pakistan. According to the University of Faisalabad, the city of Faisalabad traces its origins to the 18th century when the land was inhabited by a number of tribes living in a forestation environment. It is believed these early settlements belonged to the ancient districts of Jhang and Sandalbar, which included the area between Shahdara to Shorekot and Sangla Hill to Toba Tek Singh. By the mid-18th century, the economic and administrative collapse of provinces within the Mughal Empire, from Punjab to Bengal, led to its dissolution.  Internal unrest resulted in multiple battles for independence and further deterioration of the region, which then led to formal colonialization as established by the Government of India Act 1858, with direct control under the British Raj from 1858 to 1947.An Advanced History of Modern India By Sailendra Nath Sen, p. Introduction 14  In 1880, Poham Young C.I.E, a British colonial officer, proposed construction of a new strategic town within the area.  His proposal was supported by Sir James Broadwood Lyall, Lt. Governor of Punjab, and the city of Lyall was developed. Young designed the city centre to replicate the design in the Union Jack with eight roads extending from a large clock tower at its epicentre; a design geometrically symbolic of the Cross of Saint Andrew counterchanged with the Cross of Saint Patrick, and Saint George's Cross over all. The eight roads developed into eight separate bazaars (markets) leading to different regions of the Punjab.Integrated Slums Development Programme (ISDP): Faisaabad In 1892, the newly constructed town with its growing agricultural surplus was added to the British rail network. Construction of the rail link between Wazirabad and Lyallpur was completed in 1895. In 1896, Gujranwala, Jhang and Sahiwal comprising the Tehsils of Lyallpur were under the administrative control of the Jhang District. In 1904, the new district of Lyallpur was formed to include the tehsils of Samundri and Toba Tek Singh with a sub-tehsil at Jaranwala, which later became a full tehsil in itself. The University of Agriculture, originally the Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute, Lyallpur, was established in 1906.http://www.uaf.edu.pk/ The University of Agriculture The Town Committee was upgraded to a Municipal Committee in 1909. Lyallpur grew into an established agricultural tool and grain center built by the British. The 1930s brought industrial growth and market expansion to the textile industry as well as to food processing, grain crushing and chemicals. In August 1947, following three decades of nationalist struggles, India and Pakistan achieved independence. The British agreed to partition colonial India into two sovereign states - Pakistan with a Muslim majority, and India with a Hindu majority; however, more Muslims remained in India than what governing authorities believed would assimilate into Pakistan. The partitioning led to a mass migration of an estimated 10 million people which made it the largest mass migration in human history. India's Bengal province was divided into East Pakistan and West Bengal (India), and the Punjab Province was divided into Punjab (West Pakistan) and Punjab, India.  There were also respective divisions of the British Indian Army, the Indian Civil Service, various administrative services, the central treasury, and the railways. Riots and local fighting followed the expeditious withdrawal of the British, resulting in an estimated one million civilians deaths, particularly in the western region of Punjab.  Lyallpur, which was located in the region of the Punjab Province that became West Pakistan, was populated by a number of Hindus and Sikhs who migrated to India, while Muslim refugees from India settled in the district. In 1977, the name of the city was changed to "Faisalabad", after King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. During the eighties, the city realized an increase in foreign investment.Business ties: Faisalabad encourages Turkish investment More Faisalabadis began working abroad as bilateral ties improved within the new dominion. This led to more monetary funds returning to the city that aided the development of the region.The History of Faisalabad In 1985, the city was upgraded as a division with the districts of Faisalabad, Jhang and Toba Tek Singh. Faisalabad is governed by the City District Government comprising seven departments, including Agriculture, Community Development, Education, Finance and Planning, Health, Municipal Services, and Works and Services.http://faisalabad.gov.pk/Home/Departments The District Coordination Officer Faisalabad (DCO) is head of the City District Government and responsible for coordinating and supervising the administrative units.http://faisalabad.gov.pk/Home/CDG  Each of the seven departments has its own Executive District Officer who is charged with coordinating and overseeing the activities of their respective departments. The intention of the City District Government was to empower politics by improving governance which basically involved decentralizing administrative authority with the establishment of different departments and respective department heads, all working under one platform.  The stated vision and mission of the City District Government—Faisalabad is to "establish an efficient, effective and accountable City District Government, which is committed to respecting and upholding women, men and children's basic human rights, responsive towards people's needs, committed to poverty reduction and capable of meeting the challenges of the 21st Century. Our actions will be driven by the concerns of local people." http://faisalabad.gov.pk In 2005, Faisalabad was reorganised as a City-District composed of eight Tehsil Municipal Administrations (TMA).District Towns in Faisalabad The functions of the TMA include preparation of the spatial and land use plans, management of these development plans and exercise of control over land use, land sub-division, land development and zoning by public and private sectors, enforcement of municipal laws, rules and by-laws, provision and management of water, drainage waste and sanitation along with allied municipal services.http://lgcd.punjab.gov.pk/tma_faisalabad TMA Faisalabad Division There are 118 union councils in Faisalabad.

The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick.http://prr.hec.gov.pk/chapters/2356-2.pdf Geology Study of Pakistan: Study Area and Sampling The scalloped interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature flat-topped river terraces. These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the River Ravi on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the River Ravi and Chenab. The soil consists of young stratified silt loams or very fine sand loams which gave the subsoil a very weak structure with common kankers at only five feet. The course of the rivers within Faisalabad are winding and often subject to frequent alternations. In the rainy season, the currents are very strong. This leads to high floods in certain areas which do last for a number of days. The Rakh and Gogera canals have encouraged the water levels in the district however the belt on the river ravi has remained narrow. The river bed does include the river channels which have shifted the sand bars and low sandy levees leading to river erosion. Faisalabad is situated at the centre of the lower Rachana Doab, the area is located between the Chenab and Ravi rivers. There is on a mild slope from the north-east to the south-west with an average of 0.2-0.3 meter fall per kilometre which is equivalent to 1-1.5 feet per mile. The city is situated at an elevation of about 183.35 meters (equivalent to 612 feet above sea level). The topography is marked by valleys, local depression and high ground. The weather in the city is monitored by the Pakistan Meteorological Department.http://www.pmd.gov.pk/ Pakistan Meteorological Department The Pakistan Meteorological Department regularly provides forecasts, public warnings and rainfall information to farmers with the assistance of the National Agromet Centre.http://namc.pmd.gov.pk/advisories.php Weather Advisory for Farmers - Pakistan Meteorological Department PMDhttp://namc.pmd.gov.pk/ramc-faisalabad.php Faisalabad - National Agromet Centre Faisalabad has been classified as a hot desert climate (BWh) by the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system.

The city's population increased from 69,930 in 1941 to 179,000 in 1951 (152.2% increase).  Much of the increase is attributed to the settlement of Muslim refugees from East Punjab and Haryana, India.  In 1961, the population rose to 425,248, an increase of 137.4%.  Faisalabad set a record in the demographic history of Pakistan by registering an overall population increase of 508.1% between 1941 and 1961.  The industrial revolution of the 1960s also contributed to population growth.  In 1961, the population was 425,248.  A 1972 census ranked Faisalabad as the 3rd largest city of Pakistan with a population of 864,000.  In a 1981 census, the population was 1,092,000; however, the Faisalabad Development Authority estimated the number to be 1,232,000.  A 2014 demographic profile shows the population count at 3.038 million. The province of Punjab, in which Faisalabad is the second largest city, has prevalent sociocultural distinctions.  Population sizes vary by district but some distinguishing factors include a young age structure, high age dependency ratio, a higher percentage of males, a higher proportion of married population, and heterogeneity in castes and languages. Islam is the common heritage in the region with a 97.22% Muslim majority according to the 1998 Pakistan census report and 2001 population data sheet. Islamic influences are evident in the fundamental values of various inhabitants including cultural traditions, marriage, education, diet, ceremonies and policies.  Most marriages follow social customs and are arranged by the parents, customarily with weddings that are colorful celebrations.  Families may also celebrate the birth of a male child whereas female births are not celebrated. The prevalent minorities, particularly Hindu and Christian, feel a sense of vulnerability because of their religious beliefs.  Labourers and farmhands comprise the countless Christian villages throughout Punjab; many are descendants of people who converted from Hinduism to Christianity under the British Raj, and considered low caste by virtue of their birth. A small population of wealthy, well-educated Christians have settled in Karachi; however, as a result of increasing Islamization, religious intolerance in Pakistani society, blashphemy laws and Islamist militancy, most have left Pakistan to settle in other countries where there is more religious tolerance, such as Canada and Australia. Punjabi is the dominant language spoken by over three-fourths of the population. In the south-southwest regions, Saraiki is the common language.  The national language is Urdu, which is customarily used between various ethnic groups. Faisalabad contributes over 20% toward Pakitan's annual GDP; therefore, it is often referred to as the "Manchester of Pakistan". Faisalabad's average annual GDP is $20.55 billion (USD), of which 21% comes from agriculture. Faisalabad is the centre of the textile industry in Pakistan, contributing over 70% to the textile export market of Pakistan which comprises a share of 68% of Pakistan's total exports and represents more than a 45% share in Pakistans total exports.
