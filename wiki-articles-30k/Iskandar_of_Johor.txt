The proposal was made as Sultan Iskandar suggested that the Orang Aslis maintained a distinct identity from the Malays as the majority of them were not Muslims. The proposal was subsequently scrapped, and the government made subsequent attempts to assimilate the Orang Aslis with the mainstream Malay society.Benjamin, Chou, (2002), pg 121 After his inauguration as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, he donated his Agong's salary to various scholarship boards that were open to Malaysians of all races.Low (1988), pg 192  Sultan Iskandar issued a decree in 2007 which only allowed residences and properties owned by the Sultan and the  Mahkota to be called Istana, while properties belonging to other members of the royal family are to be known as "Kediaman".

At the inaugural session of the 12th Johor State Assembly in 2008, the Sultan stated his stand on Malaysia's sovereignty over Pedra Branca, and vowed to find legal means to retrieve the island's sovereignty. Sultan Iskandar also fostered a fairly close relationship with the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, particularly during his days as the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong.Negara Brunei Darussalam: A Biographical Dictionary (1860–1996) (1996), pg 290 In 2006, they were again seen together in public, after Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah made a state visit to Johor to express his interest in Iskandar Development Region. Prior to his life as the Sultan or Agong, and even during the 1980s and early 1990s,  Mahmud's reputation was more or less marred by a number of alleged controversial incidents which received occasional attention from the media. One of these earliest incidents was the loss of his status as  Mahkota in 1961—a position which his father, Sultan Ismail, appointed to him two years earlier, citing reasons of alleged misbehaviour after confidential reports accusing him of incarcerating a policeman reached the Sultan.Kershaw (2001), pg 103  Iskandar's younger brother, Abdul Rahman (Mahkota of Johor) Tengku is spelled as  in Johor. Tengku Ahmad Rithauddeen: His Story, K.N. Nadarajah, pg 50 was appointed as the  Mahkota in favour of him. Nevertheless, in 1966,  Iskandar was appointed the Raja Muda—which puts him second in line to the throne. In April 1981,  Mahmud was reinstated as  Mahkota shortly before his father's death the following month and was subsequently installed as the Sultan of Johor,His Majesty and Her Majesty, Retrieved  3 January 2009 under the orders of his father. However, some eyewitnesses challenged the legitimacy of  Mahmud's reappointment as the  Mahkota, by arguing that they witnessed Sultan Ismail already having lapsed into coma at the time of his appointment as the Regent. Records stated that Sultan Ismail lapsed into a coma on 8 May, three days before his death.Who's who in Malaysia (1982), pg 463 Relations with the Menteri Besar of Johor, Othman Saat deteriorated when the latter questioned  Iskandar's legitimacy to the throne, which led to an incident which saw the Sultan issuing an order to the Menteri Besar to vacate his office within 24 hours, shortly after Sultan Ismail's death, citing reasons for the need for that office space for his own. The Menteri Besar heeded his order, though the Sultan did not move in as he had said.Southeast Asian Affairs (1982), pg 251 Othman Saat subsequently resigned the following year as the Menteri Besar. In 1972,  Mahmud was charged for causing assault with a mace to two men for overtaking his car and was convicted the following year.Aliran Monthly, Aliran Kesedaran Negaran, 1992, Malaysia, pg3 A year later, reports also surfaced another similar attack upon a young couple, when  Iskandar, together with his bodyguard, attacked them with chemicals and a mace after having offended him. Another alleged incident took place at about this time when  Mahmud chained up two policemen in a dog kennel for a day after having angered him.Downton (1986), pp 203–4 Five years later,  Mahmud was charged and convicted of manslaughterCrouch (1996), pg 144 after shooting and killing a man near his private helicopter whom he took to be a smuggler. In both cases, his father, Sultan Ismail, intervened and granted official pardons to  Mahmud.Copetas, Rich (2001), pg 145Clad (1989), pg 15 Similarly, his eldest son,  Ibrahim Ismail, was convicted in the 1980s of shooting dead a man in a nightclub during a feud, but was quickly pardoned.De Ledesma, Lewis, Savage (2003), pg 366 In 1987, Sultan Iskandar was accused of causing the death of a golf caddy in Cameron Highlands by assault, following an incident in which the golf caddy laughed when the Sultan missed a hole. Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first Prime Minister, pointed out that the Sultan (then the Agong) could not be prosecuted due to the immunity that was accorded to the rulers, yet he condemned Sultan Iskandar's actions at the same time. In the end the matter was let off without much public attention. The brother of the caddy – who also suffered injuries from the incident, being distressed from what he saw, subsequently ran amok in Kuala Lumpur and had to be quarantined in a mental hospital.Crouch (1996), pg 146World of Information (Firm), (1993), pg 124 In late 1992, two separate assault cases by the Sultan himself as well as his younger son,  Abdul Majid Idris, on hockey coaches culminated in the stripping of immunity of rulers from prosecution. Both cases received considerable headlines in the local and international news which was aptly dubbed as "The Gomez Incident".Crouch (1996), pg 146–7 The incident was kicked off on 10 July 1992, when Sultan Iskandar's second son, the  Bendahara–Abdul Majid Idris, lost his temper during a hockey match with the Perak hockey team after Perak won the match by a penalty stroke, and assaulted the Perak goalkeeper, Mohamed Jaafar Mohamed Vello.Prince to appear before MHF board, by Gerald Martinez, 10 August 1992, New Straits Times The goalkeeper later lodged a police report on 30 July. The incident received public attention, especially when the matter was debated in parliament.Kershaw (2001), pg 110 The incident resulted in the Malaysian Hockey Federation issuing  Majid, (then second-in line to the throne after his elder brother) facing a ban of five years from participating in any tournaments following investigations.MHF ban  Majid for five years, by Lazarus Rokk, 19 October 1992, New Straits Times  Majid was later convicted of assault in January 1993, of which the chief justice sentenced him to a year in prison, on top of a RM 2000 fine. He was released on a bail, and these charges were later dropped on grounds of immunity, which was still applicable at the time when the act was committed.Asian Bulletin, Asian Peoples' Anti-Communist League, Asian Peoples' Anti-Communist League (China: Republic: 1949– ), Asian-Pacific Anti-Communist League, APLFD (Organization), Published by APACL Publications, 1993, pg 30 The Sultan responded to the ban by putting pressure on the state authorities to enforce isolation of the Johor hockey teams from all national tournaments. In November 1992, Douglas Gomez, a coach for the Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar field hockey team, expressed his displeasure of being called to withdraw from a semi-final national hockey match by the Director of the Johor Education Department. The incident attracted the attention of the Sultan, who personally summoned Gomez to his palace, Istana Bukit Serene, where he was promptly reprimanded and assaulted by the Sultan. Following Gomez's meeting with the Sultan, Gomez sought treatment to his face and stomach. Subsequently, he lodged a police report against the Sultan for assault. Gomez elaborated that the Sultan bodyguards, members of the Johor Military Force personnel, were merely onlookers, and that the Sultan was solely responsible for the injuries. The assault resulted in a public outcry over the event which pressured all levels of the government right up to the top ranks of the federal government to investigate into the matter. In the closing months of 1992, and also the opening months of 1993, dozens of articles mentioning misdeeds by the royal families of several states–but in particular Sultan Iskandar himself were published. A good deal of these alleged misdeeds that were mentioned included the charging of exorbitant fines–way above the prescribed legal limits–upon offenders who had obstructed the Sultan's car, amongst others. Sultan Iskandar, nevertheless bore the brunt of the backlash by the numerous references centred towards alleged acts of criminal wrongdoings even though many of the listed acts were committed by other members of the royal family.Aliran Monthly, Aliran Kesedaran Negaran, 1984, pg 30 The vociferous spate of criticisms roused by the press prompted Members of Parliament of the Dewan Rakyat to convene a special session on 10 December 1992. All 96 parliamentarians present on that day passed a unanimous resolution which called for action to curb the powers of the rulers if necessary. During the special meeting, parliamentarians disclosed past criminal records of Sultan Iskandar and his two sons, all of whom had been involved in a total of at least 23 cases of assault and manslaughter,Malaysia, Singapore & Brunei (2004), Rowthorn, Benson, Benson, Kerr, Niven, pg 235Asian Recorder (1993), pg 22904 five of which were cases committed by the Sultan after 1981, two cases by the  Mahkota and three cases by the  Bendahara. A bill was passed by both the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara on 19 and 20 January 1993 respectively.Change to take its course: PM tables amendment Bill despite Rulers' disagreement, New Straits Times,  19 January 1993, pg 1, 4. The bill, which proposed to remove legal immunity was approved by six out of nine sultansSix Rulers say 'Yes', New Straits Times,  16 January 1993, pg 1, 2—but saw stiff opposition from three, two of which included the Ismail Petra, the Sultan of Kelantan and the Sultan Iskandar himself. Sultan Iskandar took up the initiative to obtain more royal support to stall the implementation of the proposed bill. The bill, which proposed to strip rulers and members of the royal families of legal immunity, would make them prosecutable by the law in any cases of proven criminal wrongdoings.Kershaw (2001), pg 110–2 Sultan Iskandar organised a rally which was to be held outside the palace with the aim of garnering public support to stall the bill's implementation. However, this was cancelled after intense pressure from the government. A report made during the rally quoted Sultan Iskandar calling upon all local civil servants to boycott state and federal functions in a show of support for his motion.Summary of World Broadcasts (1993), Phrase: "... Straits Times of 21 January, the Sultan of Johor is reported as" Meanwhile, the federal government continued to pressure the rulers into assenting to the bills, which they did after several revisions of the bill were made by the government.  Following which, the proposed bill was enshrined into the Federal Constitution in March 1993.Crouch (1996), pg 147 The bill allowed rulers who violated the laws to be prosecuted, while the Sedition Act of 1948 was also amended to allow public criticism of the rulers.Mahathir, the Secret of the Malaysian Success: The Secret of the Malaysian Success, Somun, Somun-Krupalija, pg 155 A special court was created–presided by the Lord President of the Federal Court–to empower and prosecute members of the rulers and immediate members of the royal household.A BILL intituled: An Act to amend the Federal Constitution., Dewan Rakyat, January 1993, Retrieved  7 January 2009 Sultan Iskandar and his family members were not prosecuted for their past violations of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred.Jendela masa: kumpulan esei sempena persaraan (2001), Othman, Khoo, pg 393 Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted to take steps to rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down somewhat on his hardline image and appeared to be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him. The Gomez incident also led to a review and proposal by the Federal Government in August 1993 to disband the Johor Military Force (JMF). However, the bill to disband the JMF was subsequently repealed by parliament.Rang Undang-Undang Askar Timbalan Setia Negeri Johor (Pembubaran Dan Pemansuhan) 1994, Susunan Fasal, Dewan Rakyat, 1994Johore Military Forces (Disbandment And Repeal) Bill 1994, Dewan Rakyat, 1994, Retrieved  7 January 2009 Shortly before his election as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong in 1983, a spate of reports alleging Sultan Iskandar's intention to launch a coup d'état by launching a state of emergency to overthrow the government circulated within political circles, which reached Mahathir himself. The Sultan was reportedly having fostered close relations with several key military personnel, including the Army chief himself. The government subsequently took action to curb constitutional loopholes within the constitution and took to task of reducing the power of royal veto in passing legislation, culminating to a constitutional crisis in late 1983.Milne, Mauzy (1999), pg 32–33 Nevertheless, during his inaugural speech as the Agong in 1984, about a month after the constitutional amendments were passed in parliament, Sultan Iskandar voiced public support for the revised constitution and pledged to act in accordance to the Prime Minister's advise.Shome, Shome (2002), pg 137 A diplomatic scandal between the United Kingdom and Malaysia broke out in 1984, when several British newspapers published pieces on Sultan Iskandar's coronation, citing the headlines such as  "Killer becomes King" and "King a Killer", which enraged the Malaysian government, who demanded an apology from the British government. The British government refused to apologise on behalf of the newspapers, hence triggering tensions between the two countries. Two months later, in June 1984, Sultan Iskandar in his capacity as the Agong, surprised the Malaysian public when he publicly called upon the then-Deputy Prime Minister, Musa Hitam, to make a public apology in front of the entire congregation present at the National Mosque. Sultan Iskandar, on his part, was angry over remarks which Musa made during the course of the 1983 constitutional crisis that he deemed to be disrespectful. Musa abided to the Agong's demand and boldly came forward to make the apology, which was greeted by a thunderous applause from the entire congregation. The event, which was broadcast live throughout the nation on Malaysian Radio (although the television stations abruptly terminated its broadcast halfway), was seen by many observers as an act of confrontation by the Agong to put Musa in his place.Milne, Mauzy (1999), pg 35–36 In 1988, also serving in his capacity as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong, the Lord President of the Federal Court Tun Salleh Abas was sacked by the Agong in what led to the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis.Anwar's Second Sex Case Puts Malaysia Courts on Trial, Bloomberg, Angus Whitley,  20 August 2008 However, observers suggested a remarkably warm relationship between then-Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad with the Agong, both of whom shared common resentment against the chief justice, Salleh Abas. In 1973,  Iskandar was convicted of assault and was sentenced to six months imprisonment, of which Salleh Abas served as the public prosecutor hearing the case. As the public prosecutor, Salleh had appealed to the chief justice, Raja Azlan Shah (now the Sultan of Perak), for handing down a heavier sentence for  Iskandar, which naturally earned his wrath.Malaysian Politics: The Second Generation, Means, pg 239Kershaw (2001), pg 224 The sacking of the Lord President, was however not without controversy, given the alleged manner in which the Agong and Prime Minister had handled the matter–including an incident which the Agong had refused to forgive the Lord President in spite of Salleh's willingness to offer his apology to the Agong, which he turned down.Press Statement of Tun Salleh Abas, The Malaysian Bar, Tun Salleh Abas,  26 September 2006Comment: Tun Salleh and the judiciary, The Malaysian Bar, Suppiah s/o Pakrisamy,  29 April 2008 Sultan Iskandar's public call to support Abdullah Badawi's administration in October 2006 created a minor stir among Mahathir's supporters, when he remarked that "Mahathir should act like a pensioner". The call came at a time when Mahathir's spate of criticisms against Abdullah's were at its most vociferous period. The Sultan was the first state ruler to publicly defend the policy of the government during the period of Mahathir's criticisms against the Abdullah administration. Earlier sources however, noted Sultan Iskandar's concerns with the deepening rift between Mahathir and Abdullah and had asked to be photographed together with the two leaders during the United Malays National Organisations (UMNO) 60th anniversary celebrations in Johor Bahru. A month later, in November 2006, another small stir erupted during the launching ceremony of the Iskandar Development Region, when Sultan Iskandar voiced his opinion that the Causeway, which connects Johor and Singapore, should be removed to allow ships to pass through and promoting development of the state. He also remarked that the people should be wary of all foreigners as they were "vultures" and also urged the people not to hold them in high regard, citing his displeasure that his ancestors were "deceived" by dirty tactics employed by colonialists to build the Causeway. At the inaugural 12th Johor State Assembly Seating in April 2008, a minor controversy erupted when one opposition member of parliament (MP), Gwee Tong Hiang, flouted dress regulations by appearing in a lounge suit and tie instead of the usual official attire and songkok. This resulted in him being dismissed from the assembly chamber shortly before the Sultan's arrival.DAP rep thrown out of assembly, Gladys Tay and Farik Zolkepli,  20 June 2008, The Star (Malaysia) Gwee, a Democratic Action Party (DAP) MP, reportedly argued that there was no stated order to wear the official attire and songkok and stated his desire to wear a western suit,No uniform or songkok?

He was also known to be a motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies. These documentaries drew criticisms from the Malaysian public, who felt that the television clips of Sultan Iskandar were inappropriate for its theme and national image.Kershaw (2001), pg 225 As a youth,  Mahmud qualified as a pilot, having trained in handling light and medium aircraft and helicopters. He was also apt in handling motorcycles, reportedly possessing the skills to strip a motorcycle down to its component parts and then reassembling it. The Sultan is also well known for his passion in many types of open-air sports, especially golf. In his later years, he spent much of his free time at the Royal Johor Country Club.http://www.examspaonline.info/ In addition, he also played tennis and squash on a regular basis.

In addition, he kept a large collection of pets, particularly peacocks, at his Istana Bukit Serene compound, where he lived with the Sultanah.
