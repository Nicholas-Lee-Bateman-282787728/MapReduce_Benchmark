     The Chevrolet Impala   is a full-size (upper mid-size from 2000 to 2013) automobile built by Chevrolet for model years 1958 to 1985, 1994 to 1996, and 2000 to present. Deriving its name from the African antelope of the same name, Chevrolet's most expensive passenger model through 1965 had become the best-selling automobile in the United States. For its debut in 1958, the Impala was distinguished from lesser models by its symmetrical triple taillights, which returned from 1960 to 1996. The Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for model year 1965 becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Bel Air and the Biscayne. The Impala continued as Chevrolet's most popular full-size model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994 and 1996, the Impala was revived as a 5.7-liter V8–powered version of the Caprice Classic sedan. In 2000, the Impala was re-introduced again as a mainstream front-wheel drive Hi-Mid sedan.The editors of Consumer Guide As of February 2014, the 2014 Impala ranked number one among Affordable Large Cars in U.S. News & World Report's rankings. When the current tenth generation of the Impala was introduced for the 2014 model year, the ninth generation was rebadged as the Impala Limited and sold only to fleet customers through 2016. As of the 2015 model year, both versions are sold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, with the current-generation Impala also sold in the Middle East, the Philippines, and South Korea. The Impala name was first used for the full-sized 1956 General Motors Motorama show car that bore Corvette-like design cues, especially the grille. Painted emerald green metallic, with a white interior, the Impala featured hardtop styling. Clare MacKichan's design team, along with designers from Pontiac, started to establish basic packaging and dimensions for their shared 1958 General Motors "A" body in June. The first styling sketch that would directly influence the finished Chevrolet automobile was seen by General Motors Styling vice president Harley Earl in October. Seven months later, the basic design was developed. The Impala was introduced for the 1958 model year as top of the line Bel Air hardtops and convertibles. From the windshield pillar rearward, the 1958 Bel Air Impala differed structurally from the lower-priced Chevrolet models. Hardtops had a slightly shorter greenhouse and longer rear deck. The wheelbase of the Impala was longer than the lower priced models, although the overall length was identical. Interiors held a two-spoke steering wheel and color-keyed door panels with brushed aluminum trim. No other series included a convertible. The 1958 models were longer, lower, and wider than its predecessors.The Editors of Consumer Guide The tailfins of the 1957 were replaced by deeply sculptured rear fenders. Impalas has three taillights each side, while lesser models had two and wagons just one. Crossed-flag insignias were attached above the side moldings, as well as bright rocker moldings and dummy rear-fender scoops. 1958 was the first year of dual headlamps. For 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet.Image of 50th Anniversary promotional photo The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Holiday 88, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala. The standard perimeter-type frame was abandoned, replaced by a unit with rails laid out in the form of an elongated "X." Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional rigidity and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment. This was a transitional step between traditional construction and the later fully unitized body/chassis, the body structure was strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall.Chevrolet engineering-1958 Chevrolets However, this frame was not as effective in protecting the interior structure in a side impact crash, as a traditional perimeter frame. A coil spring suspension replaced the previous year's rear leaf springs, and an air ride system was optional. A  engine was the standard V8, with ratings that ranged from 185 to 290 horsepower. A "W" block (not to be confused with the big-block)  Turbo-Thrust V8 was optional, producing , , or . The Ramjet fuel injection was available as an option for the Turbo-Fire 283 V8, not popular in 1958. A total of 55,989 Impala convertibles and 125,480 coupes were built representing 15&nbsp;percent of Chevrolet production. The 1958 Chevrolet Bel Air Impala helped Chevrolet regain the number one production spot in this recession year. 200px" heights="150px 1958 Chevrolet Bel Air Impala Sport Coupe 1958 Chevrolet Bel Air Impala Convertible The 1959 Chevrolet Impala was redesigned. Sharing bodyshells with lower-end Buicks and Oldsmobiles as well as with Pontiac, part of a GM economy move, the Chevrolet's wheelbase 1-1/2&nbsp;inches longer. Using a new X-frame chassis, the roof line was three inches lower, bodies were two inches wider, and curb weight increased. Its tailfins protruded outward, rather than upward. The taillights were a large "teardrop" design at each side. The Impala became a separate series, adding a four-door hardtop and four-door sedan, to the two-door Sport Coupe and convertible. Sport Coupes featured a shortened roof line and wrap-over back window. The standard engine was an I6, while the base V8 was the carryover , at . Optional were a 283&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in with  and  V8 up to . Standard were front and rear armrests, an electric clock, dual sliding sun visors, and crank-operated front vent windows. A contoured hooded instrument panel held deep-set gauges. A six-way power seat was a new option, as was "Speedminder",  for the driver to set a needle at a specific speed and a buzzer would sound if the pre-set was exceeded. The 1960 Impala models reinstated three round taillights on each side, a nonfunctional front air intake scoops, and a white band running along the rear fender. The available V8s were reduced to seven, in 283-cu&nbsp;in or 348-cu&nbsp;in displacements.  The carbureted Turbo-Fire 283&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in V8 could have either . The 348&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in was available in  with a  Super Turbo-Thrust Special with triple two-barrel carburetors, 11.25:1 compression ratio, and dual exhausts. Fuel injection was no longer an option on full-size Chevrolets. New to the options list was speed and cruise control. Production was 490,000 units. Right-hand drive cars were made in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, for New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa and assembled locally from CKD or SKD kits. The right-hand drive dashboard was a mirror image of the 1959 Chevrolet panel and shared with equivalent right-hand drive Pontiac models. Australian models were assembled by hand on the GMH Holden assembly lines. 200px" heights="150px 1959 Chevrolet Impala 4-Door Sedan 1959 Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe 1960 Chevrolet Impala 4-Door Sedan 1960 Chevrolet Impala Sport Sedan 1960 Chevrolet Impala Convertible  The Impala was restyled on the GM B platform for the first time for 1961. The new body styling was more trim and boxy than the 1958–1960 models. Sport Coupe models featured a "bubbleback" roof line style for 1961, and a unique model, the 2-door pillared sedan, was available for 1961 only. It was rarely ordered and a scarce collectible today. The rare Super Sport (SS) option debuted for 1961. This was also the last year the top station wagon model would bear the Nomad name. Power brakes were $43. The 1962 model featured new "C" pillar styling for all models except the 4-door hardtop. Sport Coupe models now featured the "convertible roof" styling, shared with other GM "B" full-size hardtop coupes. This style proved extremely popular, and contributed to the desirability of the 1962–1964 Impalas as collectibles. The "overhang" roof style of the sedans was replaced with a more attractive, wider "C" pillar with wraparound rear window. Engine choices for 1962 settled down, the  V8 discontinued and replaced by the  or 409&nbsp;bhp 409 cubic inch engine. These engines could only be ordered with a manual shift transmission. The small-block 283 was offered with a two barrel carburetor. The 283 was also enlarged to ,offered in two versions, one with 250 brake horse power and one with 300 brake horse power. Which added more engine choices for small-block fans. The Beach Boys produced a hit single, "409," referring to the Chevrolet, which became an iconic song for these cars. Impalas again featured premium interior appointments, plusher seats pillar mounted seat belts as well as lap belts also this could be done by the dealerships on customer request.And more chrome trim outside, including a full-width aluminum-and-chrome panel to house the triple-unit taillight assembly. Super Sport (SS) models featured that panel in a special engine-turned aluminum, which was also used to fill the side moldings, making the SS more distinctive in appearance. Impala also gains the top station wagon after the Chevrolet Nomad is gone. Due to reliability problems, the optional Turboglide automatic transmission was discontinued, leaving Powerglide the only automatic transmission available until 1965. A new radio was optional. The 1963 Impala featured rectilinear styling with an engine-turned aluminum rear taillight panel surrounded by a chrome border on SS models. Engine choice was similar to 1962, with the small-block  V8s most popular. The Sport Sedan featured a new, creased roof line. A new "coved" instrument panel with simple indicator lights for hot and cold engine conditions. An optional factory tachometer was built into the dashboard, just above the steering wheel; it was rarely ordered. For 1964, the Impala was restyled to a more rounded, softer look. The signature taillight assembly had an "upside-down U" shaped aluminum trim strip above the taillights, but the individual lights were surrounded by a body-colored panel. The  returned as the big-block option, as well as the 2X4 carburetor setup for the 425 horsepower motors. SS models continued to feature the engine-turned aluminum trim. Rooflines were carried over from 1963 unchanged. Back-up lights were standard. Right hand drive cars were made at GM's Oshawa plant in Canada and often shipped overseas in kit form for assembly in South Africa and New Zealand. The RHD cars&nbsp;— Chevrolet or equivalent Pontiac (built on Chevrolet frames and using Chevrolet engines in Canada)&nbsp;— all used a right hand drive version of the left hand drive 1961 Pontiac dashboard.    Redesigned in 1965, the Impala set an all-time industry annual sales record of more than 1 million units in the U.S.. All new full-size Chevrolets eschewed the "X" frame for a full-width perimeter frame, a new body which featured curved, frameless side glass (for pillarless models), sharper angled windshield with newly reshaped vent windows, and redesigned full-coil suspension. In 1965 Chevrolet introduced the Impala Caprice, exclusively as a four-door hardtop. Caprices received tufted upholstery, wood grained accents on the dashboard and specialty pulls on the insides of the doors. This "halo" model also featured the "spinner" wheel covers from the Impala SS, with the "SS" logo centers replaced by a Chevrolet "bowtie" emblem. The Super Sport's blackout rear trim strip below the triple taillights was also used, with the "Impala SS" emblem deleted of course. The Caprice Custom was reintroduced as the Chevrolet Caprice in 1966, taking the top position in the full-size Chevrolet lineup. Engine choices included the inline six-cylinder as well as the small-block and big-block V8s. A newly three-range Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission was optional for  V8. The old  "W" engine was discontinued early in the 1965 model year, so early-production 1965s got the 409, as well as 1/10 of 1% had the 396 CID big-block. Other later-built cars had the  as the big-block option. Two-speed Powerglide, as well as 3- and 4-speed manual transmissions were available. As with previous years, Impalas featured more chrome trim inside and out, with pleated tufted upholstery and door panels. The Impala would be the #2-selling convertible in the U.S. in 1966, with 38,000 sold; it was beaten by the Mustang by almost 2:1.Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. American Cars 1960–1972 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.412. The 1967 model was redesigned with enhanced Coke bottle styling which featured Corvette-inspired front and rear fender bulges. The curves were the most pronounced with the 1967–1968 models. In keeping with federal regulations, safety features were built into Impalas during the 1967 and 1968 model years, including a fully collapsible energy-absorbing steering column, side marker lights, and shoulder belts for closed models. A black 1967 Sport Sedan 4-door hardtop was used in the television series Supernatural, and as such, this model has seen a substantial increase in value to collectors.   The 1968 model was facelifted with a new front end, The new rear bumper housed triple "horseshoe" shaped taillights. 1968 also saw a new Impala model, the Custom Coupe. This two-door hardtop featured the same formal roofline as the Caprice Coupe. It was a huge commercial success and would be continued right through 1976. The 1969 Impala and other full-sized Chevrolets got new slab-sided bodies with a small "upsweep" at the rear quarter window, giving them a more formal appearance. It retained the 119-inch wheelbase from previous models. New front bumpers that wrapped around the grille and horizontal taillights were in the rear bumper. The hardtop Sport Coupe got a new, crisply styled notchback roofline, replacing the "fastback" C-pillar from 1967 to 1968. Ventless front windows were used on all models. Chevrolet had a rudimentary "power vent" system featuring vents in the instrument panel. The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, and when the key was removed, the steering wheel and shift lever were locked. The 1969 model year Impala production topped Caprice production by 611,000 units. Impala station wagons were renamed Kingswood, a name which would continue through 1972. The similar 1970 Impala got a minor facelift featuring a more conventional under the grille bumper replacing the wrap-around unit used in 1969 along with new triple vertical taillights in the rear bumper. Canadian buyers got the choice of a lower priced companion to the Impala Sport Coupe, the Bel Air Sport Coupe, which used the same body but featured Bel Air trim. Right hand drive cars were manufactured in Canada for export to countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, etc., until 1969. They used a version of the 1965 Impala dash panel&nbsp;— without provision for a radio and installed in a dashboard moulding made of fibreglass, not metal&nbsp;— until 1969. Radios (centrally mounted) and heaters were locally sourced and wipers parked in the center of the windscreen. Australian models were assembled in Australia from kits, as this lessened tax on the cars. The Australian cars had locally sourced amber flashing rear indicators replacing the clear reversing lenses, as red flashers were banned there. For New Zealand assembly, the bodies were supplied from Canada already welded, painted and trimmed. In 1961, the Impala SS (Super Sport) was introduced to the market. The SS badge was to become Chevrolet's signature of performance on many models, though it often has been an appearance package only. The Impala's factory SS package in 1961 was truly a performance package when so equipped from the factory with both the trim and "mandatory" suspension and engine upgrades, beginning with the  V8 engines available with , , and  or the new  V8, which was available with up to . Unlike all other years, the 1961 Super Sport package was available on any Impala, including sedans and station wagons (the sales brochure shows a 4-door hardtop Sport Sedan with the SS package). The package also included upgraded tires on station wagon wheels, springs, shocks and special sintered metallic brake linings. Only 142 1961 Impala Super Sports came from the factory with the 409, making it a most rare and desirable collectible. In addition to the factory-installed SS package, Chevrolet dealers could add SS trim to any standard Impala without the "mandatory" performance upgrades, and a number of '61s were so equipped. Starting for the 1962 model year, the Impala SS was an appearance package limited to hardtop coupe and convertible coupe models, available with all engines in the Impala series starting with the base ,  inline-6 through 1967, though the big-block engines and heavy-duty parts could still be ordered. From 1967 to 1969, an additional model, the SS427, was available.   The Super Sport was known as Regular Production Option (RPO) Z03, from 1962 to 1963, and again in 1968. From 1964 through 1967, the Super Sport was a separate model, with its own VIN prefix (for V8 models, 168 versus the 164 for the regular Impala). Super Sports from 1962 to 1964 came with engine-turned aluminum trim, which was replaced by a "blackout" trim strip in 1965 which ran under the taillights. 1965 Super Sport exteriors differed only slightly from regular Impalas. Rocker panel trim was deleted. "Super Sport" scripts replaced the "Impala SS" badges. The new center console housed a rally-type electric clock, and full instrumentation now included a vacuum gauge. A total of 243,114 Impala SS coupes and convertibles were built for 1965. The 1966 Impala SS was facelifted with a revised grille and new rectangular taillights that replaced the triple round units. A chrome beltline strip shared with regular Impalas was added in response to complaints about door dings on the clean-lined 1965s. Inside were new Strato bucket seats with thinner and higher seat backs, and a center console with an optional gauge package available. Sales of the 1966 Impala SS dropped by more than 50% to around 117,000 units; this was mainly due to the sport/performance car market switching from full-sized models to intermediates (including Chevrolet's own Chevelle SS396 and Pontiac GTO), along with the emerging market for the even smaller pony car market created by the Ford Mustang in 1964 that Chevrolet would respond to with the Camaro for 1967. The 1967 Impala SS was less decorated than other Impalas; Super Sports had black grille accents and black-accented body-side and rear fender moldings. Lesser models leaned more toward brightwork inside and out. Buyers could choose either vinyl bucket seats with a center console, or a Strato-Bench seat with a fold-down center armrest. Standard wheel covers were the same as the optional full covers on other big Chevrolets, but the centers featured the "SS" logo surrounded by tri-color ring of red, white and blue. "Chevrolet" and "Impala" callouts on the body were all replaced by attractive "Impala SS" badges. Of the 76,055 Impala SS models built, just 2,124 were ordered with RPO Z24, a special performance package that included RPO F41 heavy-duty suspension and other performance goodies, RPO L36 ( Turbo-Jet  V8, as well as a special trim package that replaced the "Impala SS" badges with large "SS427" emblems on the front grille and rear trim. None of these special cars had the name "Impala" anywhere on the body or interior, and Chevrolet often marketed them as the "Chevrolet SS427," sans the "Impala" name.  The Z24 package also included a special hood with fake chrome-plated intake. Only about 400 Super Sports had a six-cylinder engine from 1967 to 1968,  in 1969, or L72 () from 1968 to 1969. Special SS427 badging, inside and out, was the rule, but few were sold, since muscle car enthusiasts were seeking big-block intermediates, such as the Chevelle SS396 and Plymouth Road Runner. In 1968 as Caprice sales escalated, those of the Impala Super Sport suffered a decline. Much of this drop in sales was no doubt due to the availability of big-block engines in the mid-sized (and lighter) Chevelle, and even Novas could be special-ordered with the 396 engine with the new-for-1968 body. No longer a separate series, the Super Sport was a mere $179 option package (Regular Production Option Z03) for the two Impala coupes and the convertible. Only 38,210 Impalas were so-equipped, including 1,778 with the Z24 package, which was carried over from 1967. In 1968 only, SS427s could be ordered without the Z03 SS package, which meant SS427 equipment but no bucket seats, SS door panels, or center console. The Z03 Impala SS could be identified by "Impala Super Sport" badges on the front grille, rear fenders and trunk lid. Z24-optioned cars included "SS427" emblems to replace the "Impala Super Sport" badges, a special layered "pancake" hood, and three "gills" mounted on the front fender aft of the wheel well à la Corvette Stingray. Because of their rarity, Z24 cars command a much higher price on the collector-car market today. Although many owners tried to "clone" regular Impalas into SS427s, the unavailability of the special hoods and other trim items (on the 1967 and 1968 cars) makes this a difficult (and expensive) process to successfully execute. In 1969, the Impala SS was available only as the Z24 (SS427), coming exclusively with a  V8 of , , or . This was the final year for the Impala SS until 1994. Unlike the previous two years, the '69s finally got "Impala" script on the front fenders and interior.  The 1969 Impala SS was often considered a "sleeper" in that there was no distinctive SS badging inside the car except for an "SS" logo the steering wheel (again, there was no Z03 offered that year), and a true 1969 Z24-optioned car is the rarest and most collectible of any year with this package available. Like the 1968s, the Z24 could be ordered on the Impala convertible, Sport Coupe, or Custom Coupe. 1969 was the last year that the Impala SS was offered with the Z24 package, but the only year in which front disc brakes and  wheels were standard; that made the 1969 SS427 mechanically better than the previous versions in standard form. Therefore, the potential buyer of an advertised 1969 SS427 that has 14-inch wheels and/or drum brakes in front, would be aware that such a car may not be an authentic Z24 original. Although sales of 1969 Z24-optioned Impalas increased to approximately 2,455 units from the 1,778 Z03-optioned units of 1968, and high-powered big-block V8 engines continued to be available, there would be no Impala SS for 1970. The 427 was also replaced on the engine offerings list by a new Turbo-Jet 454 producing 390&nbsp;hp for 1970. The 1965–1970 GM B platform is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the Volkswagen Beetle, Ford Model T and the Lada Riva.  The Impala remained Chevrolet's top-selling model with the fifth generation. A high-performance big block V8 was still available in the form of the Turbo-Jet 454, which produced 365&nbsp;hp in 1971, but power decreased as the years went along. The 1971 redesigned B-body would be the largest car ever offered by Chevrolet. The hardtop Sport Coupe continued to be offered; it was a smoothly sloped semi-fastback reminiscent of the 1961 "bubbletop" styling. A three-speed manual transmission remained standard at the beginning of the year, but in the spring of 1971 all V8-equipped full-size GM cars got Turbo Hydra-Matic as standard equipment. Interestingly, Powerglide remained optionally available for six-cylinder cars until the 1973 models. In keeping with their huge size, these new "B" body Chevrolets were close to Cadillac in luxury features, styling, and ride. The 1972 model introduced a grille which extended below the bumper. Powertrains consisted of mostly V8 engines. The 250 inline six was still standard for Sport Coupe and 4-door sedan models; the 350 2bbl V8 became the standard engine from 1973–1976, with , ,  (through 72) or . The best-selling body style was the Custom Coupe. Beginning in 1972, all engines were designed to run on unleaded gasoline. 1972 saw the last Impala convertible; it sold 6,456 copies, placing fourth with just under 9 percent of the market, right behind the Corvette 6,508, ahead of the Mustang's 6,401.Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. American Cars 1960–1972 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.865. 1973 Chevrolets featured a larger, shock-absorbing front bumper due to new federal mandates which required  impact protection. New taillights were mounted in the (still) conventional rear bumper. This was the first year of the Caprice Classic convertible. Tweaks to the suspension and frame gave better roadability, according to Chevrolet general manager John Z. DeLorean. Steering wheels and instrument panels were color-keyed to interior colors, as opposed to the matte black used in 1971–1972. The inline six-cylinder engine was now offered on the Bel Air 4-door sedan only, and only with the 3-speed manual transmission. Interiors had repositioned front seats for more legroom. The Impala name returned for the Kingswood station wagon. In 1974, the rear bumper was redesigned with shock absorbers to meet the upgraded standards and new tail lights were featured. The front end was also freshened as in previous years, with a new grille and headlight bezels, a new header panel, and a bumper with a drop down center section. The marker lights moved back up beside the headlamps once again. This was the only year of the 1971–1976 models the Impala had a different front end design than the Caprice Classic, as other years used either a grille insert or previous year Caprice front to distinguish the two. The rooflines of the Impala coupes were also revised. For 1974 the Custom Coupe was no longer a hardtop, with large fixed rear quarter glass and a thick B-pillar. The Sport Coupe, still a pillar-less hardtop, now used larger roll-down quarter glass like that of the 1971–1973 Custom Coupe, and had a narrower, fastback style, flat back window. Sedans used carryover body shells from previous years. A limited-edition Spirit of America package was offered in 1974 on Sport Coupe models; primarily an appearance package, it featured white or blue body paint, a white full vinyl top, white upholstery with red or blue trim, color-keyed seat belts and floormats, special wheel covers, optional white rally wheels, sports-styled dual remote outside rear view mirrors, a vinyl body side molding insert, and red pin-striping. Special fender and dashboard badges announced the package to passers-by and passengers. Chevrolet also offered Nova and Vega Spirit of America versions as well. The 1975 Impala used a 1974 carried-over Caprice front end, with a grille insert and emblem change. The Caprice model was revised with a new front end with a swept back style header panel with recessed headlight buckets, a new hood, and new fenders. Also in 1975 upholstery, door panels and the dashboard were revised as were the radio and climate control graphics. Speedometers read up to , and added kilometers per hour. A High Energy Ignition (HEI) system was officially introduced in 1975, although it was installed on some 1974 cars as a clandestine option. Catalytic converters were also introduced, as were several new options, including an Econominder gauge package (which also included a coolant temperature gauge), intermittent wipers, and a divided 50/50 bench seat with passenger-side recliner (with a choice of sport cloth or vinyl trim. This was the final year of the full-size Chevrolet convertible. Four-door models got new rooflines; the hardtop Sport Sedan got a small triangular "opera window" carved out of the wide roof panel. A Landau model available for 1975–1976 models featured a Landau (automobile) vinyl roof (with a chrome band across the roof), a choice of special paint colors, sports-styled dual remote outside rearview mirrors, color-keyed wheel covers, a vinyl bodyside molding insert, and pin-striping. Inside were color-keyed seat belts and floormats. Fender and dashboard emblems rounded out the package. The 2-door hardtop model (dubbed the "Sport Coupe") was discontinued after 1975, leaving redesigned Custom Coupe, with its wide "B" pillar and fixed rear window, the only 2-door Impala available in 1976. This body style had been introduced for the 1974 model year, a precursor to Detroit's complete abandonment of pillarless body styles before the end of the Seventies. 1976 Impalas used a previous year Caprice nose, with a new "egg crate" grille insert. The Impala had round headlamps while the Caprice used the new quad rectangular ones. Inline-Six: 90° V6: Small-block V8: Big-block V8:   The changes in the automobile marketplace resulted in Chevrolet redesigning the Impala once again in 1976 to meet changing demands. The new downsized Impalas were shorter in length, taller and narrower than before. The new Impala's frame was a shortened version of the one introduced in 1970 and would be utilized until 1996 when the B-body production line was shut down. Even with its trimmer exterior dimensions, the new Impala featured increased headroom, rear-seat legroom and trunk space.1978 Chevrolet Full Size brochure Production of the downsized model increased substantially over 1976, and the Impala regained the number one US sales position. The redesigned 1977 Impala/Caprice was named Motor Trend car of the year. The new body was taller and narrower than the 1976 model. Pillarless hardtops were discontinued, the result of rumors of federal rollover standards looming in the near future. The 1977–1979 coupes sported a double bent tempered rear window similar to the 1987 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Aerocoupe. In 1980, all new sheet-metal was used, although the body style remained similar. Engine availability was reduced for 1977; the inline-6 was reintroduced with . Options included  V8 engines. The  V8 engine was optional in some years. Oldsmobile's  V8 diesel engine also was available. Starting in 1980, the inline 6 was replaced by a generic 229 cubic-inch V6 from Chevrolet which was totally different from the 3.8 liter (231 cubic inch) V-6 from Buick that was installed in numerous GM models of different divisions. The Impala and the upscale Caprice sold well into the early 1980s. The Impala was reduced to the base model full-size Chevrolet and was popular with fleet usage&nbsp;– including taxi and police pursuit vehicles, but was discontinued in 1985, while the Caprice continued unchanged until 1990. Upon the demise of the Impala, the base model full-size Chevrolet was rebranded Caprice starting in 1986, with the upper models being called the Caprice Classic and Caprice Classic Brougham.  In January 1990, the GM B platform was extensively redesigned for the 1991 model year, though it retained the same shortened frame design of the 1977 model year redesign. The Impala SS badge was resurrected at the 1992 Detroit Auto Show as a concept car designed by GM designer Jon Moss. The concept car was two inches lower to the ground than the regular Caprice, and was powered by a  engine. Eventually, the concept car's engine was replaced with a  engine derived from the Corvette in order to show the public what would be offered if put into production (an off-road specification  V8 was eventually put into the engine bay of the prototype years later). The 1994 Impala SS went into production on February 14, 1994 at GM's plant in Arlington, Texas, and was almost identical cosmetically to the concept car, the only noticeable change being the chromed bowtie logo on the grill (vs a red logo on the concept). The car was, in essence, a high-performance version of the Caprice. From a mechanical standpoint, it used the Caprice 9C1 police package as its base and as such got most of the equipment formerly available only to law enforcement and government agencies. This included a sport-tuned suspension with reinforced shocks and springs, a high-capacity reverse flow cooling system (derived from the Corvette's LT1), larger four-wheel disc brakes, transmission cooler, dual exhaust, a higher-output electrical system, and other minor mechanical alterations. Not all of the police equipment was carried over however, as the Impala SS did not get the external oil-to-air engine oil cooler, nor were all the body mounts secured (the standard Caprice and Impala SS were assembled at the factory with the front 3 body mounts missing one of the rubber cushions, while the 9C1 was assembled with all rubber cushions in place), although both are popular aftermarket additions to the Impala SS by their owners. The Impala SS was uniquely fitted with a standard 3.08 gear. The limited-slip rear differential was standard (as opposed to the option G80 on Caprices) and the suspension was an inch lower. A retuned LT1  small-block V8 was standard on the Impala SS, making  and  of torque (retuned from the prototype's  rating). The primary difference between the LT1 in the Impala and the LT1 that was in the Corvette and Camaro was that the Impala engine was fitted with cast-iron cylinder heads instead of aluminum ones, and a camshaft that was designed more for low-end torque than high-end horsepower. Another difference was that the block casting for the Impala LT1 had 2-bolt main bearing caps while the casting used for the Corvette LT1 had 4-bolt main bearing caps. The transmission used in the car was the 4L60E, which was an electronically controlled version of the previously hydraulically controlled 4L60. However, the transmission was not beefed up for the power of the LT1, and transmission failures after  were commonplace.  A manual transmission was never available in the 1994–1996 Impala SS. However, there is a growing trend of replacing the 4L60-E transmission with the T-56 (6-speed manual) from the Camaro and Firebird using aftermarket kits. B-Body High Performance (BBHP) produced a popular six-speed conversion kit from 1999 - 2014. In 2015, the company changed it's name to Three Pedals, LLC, and introduced their second-generation Impala conversion kit with a combined clutch and brake pedal unit. Another popular enhancement was the addition of a shift-kit and/or a more aggressive torque converter. Several other cars in the B/D-body line also shared a similar powertrain: these were the Chevrolet Caprice, Buick Roadmaster, and the [D-body] Cadillac Fleetwood which all shared the LT1 engine and 4L60E automatic transmission. Cosmetically, the Impala SS received body-colored trim, which helped reduce the sometimes "bloated" look of the standard Caprice, a unique single-bar grille with no hood ornament and, a rear deck spoiler. It was fitted with  brushed aluminum wheels with 255/50ZR17 all-season Z-rated tires. Inside, the car came with a central console with cup holders (1994 and 1995 models) and a storage compartment, leather seats embroidered with the Impala SS logo, and a standard leather-wrapped steering wheel. For the 1994 model year, it was available only in black with a gray interior. Due to a shortage of the unique five-spoke aluminum wheels, only 6,303 cars were sold. However, the wheel shortage was remedied for the 1995 model year and 21,434 cars were sold. In 1995, Dark Cherry Metallic and Dark Grey Green were added as exterior color options, and the body paneling on the rear quarter panel was altered to reflect the cosmetic effect formerly achieved by a window insert. Another change from 1994 was the placement of the side mirrors from pods attached to the door to a larger format attached to the 'A' pillar. 1996 was the last year of production with 41,941 units sold. The 1996 Impala SS was also exported to the Middle East as the Caprice SS with the car being identical to its American counterpart expect for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel & the badge on the dashboard saying Caprice SS. The 1996 Impala SS production went late into the model year; the last one being produced on December 13, 1996. It saw minor interior alterations, with the digital speedometer being replaced by an analog one, along with a tachometer. The shifter was moved from the column to the center console, and the engine was given an OBD-II computer control system (the camshaft was reground to adjust for the new computer). The entire B-body line, consisting of the Chevrolet Caprice, Impala SS, and Buick Roadmaster, was discontinued, as GM wanted more assembly lines to be able to produce more profitable SUVs. A ceremony was held at the plant on December 13, 1996 as the last Impala SS was produced.   The Impala name was resurrected for the 2000 model year as the "Hi-Mid" program to replace the Lumina. Based on the Lumina's W-body platform, it was built at Oshawa Car Assembly in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. Unlike the earlier Impalas built on a B-body, this one was front-wheel drive and was available with a choice of two 3.8L V6 engines, and slightly smaller 3.4L V6 engine. A new Impala SS with a supercharged V6 was brought out for the 2004 model year. The Impala was available in two trim levels from 2000 to 2003. The base model came equipped with cloth bench seats, steel wheels, the  3.4 liter (204 cu in) LA1 V6, and a 3-gauge instrument cluster. The LS came factory-equipped with cloth bucket seats upgradeable to leather with center console and floor shift, color-keyed "Impala" door scripts and trunk badge, anti-lock brakes, traction control system, keyless remote entry, integrated foglamps, aluminum wheels upgradeable to alloy wheels, rear spoiler (optional on the base models), 4-gauge instrument cluster, and the larger  3.8 liter (231 cu in) L36 V6. Options available on all models included a sunroof, OnStar system, Driver Information Center with built-in HomeLink system, heated power front seats, and 16&nbsp;inch 1990s SS-inspired wheels. All models came equipped with power windows, door locks and mirrors. The rear spoiler was an option on base models, and could be deleted from LS models upon buyers request. For the first time since 1959, Chevrolet offered an Impala that did not have or emulate the model's signature triple taillight treatment. The 2004 to 2005 Impala SS came equipped with the 3.8 liter (231 cu in) supercharged L67 V6 engine. It was rated at  and had been previously used in the Pontiac Grand Prix GTP, Buick Regal GS, Buick Riviera, and H-body Pontiac Bonneville SSEI and Buick Park Avenue "Ultra". The lightweight front-wheel-drive sedan was actually as quick as the vaunted 1990s Impala SS, with  times pushing 6.5 seconds, compared to the earlier model's time also showing 6.5 seconds (albeit 7.1 seconds on average).Car and Driver (June 1994 issue) http://fastestlaps.com/tests/fvibmjb2g4nhSee inside PDF reference To commemorate Chevrolet's long relationship with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500 race, a limited edition (4,088 produced) Impala Indy SS was offered in 2004, featuring black grille with gold Chevrolet bowtie emblem that would be carried over to all Impala models in 2005, various Indy logos on the exterior and interior, 17-inch chrome wheels, gauge cluster package, and more.  Also released with this version were the Police Package first released in 2000 and Undercover Police Package first released in 2001, named 9C1 and 9C3, respectively. Available only to law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and EMS agencies, it has had more success than its predecessor, the Lumina 9C3. The 9C1 was a base model with a stronger suspension and the 3.8 liter (231 cu in) V6 engine. It was only available in a few basic colors. Another addition was the "SURV MODE" switch that replaced the fog light switch found on the LS. This enabled the driver to turn off all lights in the vehicle and "hide"; something not allowed with the civilian models, as automatic headlights were standard. The 9C3 was comparably equipped to the 9C1, but the ability to add other convenience options and more paint and interior choices set the 9C3 apart. The 2006 Impala was introduced at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show. Like the Buick LaCrosse, the ninth generation Impala used the updated GM W platform. The base engine was a 3.5 liter (214 cu in) V6 producing  and  of torque at 4000 rpm. The new Impala featured new taillights, different from the four-circle style of the previous generation. This Impala mostly sold to fleet operators, with private buyers only accounting for a quarter of sales. The SS model used the Generation IV small-block V8, the first to do so in a front-wheel-drive Chevrolet, and the first V8 in a Chevrolet sedan since the 1996 Caprice. The 5.3 liter (325 cu in) V8 (with Displacement on Demand, called Active Fuel Management or AFM) produced .[ ] With the use of the 5.3 liter LS4 V8, the Impala SS is capable of a 5.6 second  time and a quarter-mile time of 14.2 seconds traveling at .2006 Chevrolet Impala SS&nbsp;– Road Test / Family Four Doors / Car Shopping / Hot Lists / Reviews / Car and Driver&nbsp;– Car And Driver The ninth generation Impala was  long,  high, and  wide. Available trim levels for the ninth generation were the LS, LT, LTZ, and the SS, respectively. Six-passenger seating was only available as an option on the LS and LT models. Leather upholstery was standard on LTZ models and optional on LT models. The ninth generation Impala featured a wood trim center console with chrome accents on all major control buttons. The dashboard featured a chrome Impala logo embedded in the wood grain trim that runs across the dashboard and onto the doors. The control knobs found throughout the vehicle's cockpit were similar to those found in Buick models as well as the Cadillac DTS, all of which featured a similar center console. Another interior revision was the location of the cup holders, which were moved beneath the midsection of the vehicle's center console. The LS was the base model. It offered steel wheels with wheel covers (later alloy wheels), an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, auxiliary input jack, and six speakers, keyless entry, air conditioning, cloth seating surfaces, and a choice of two front bucket or a single front bench seat. The LT was the mid-range model. It offered alloy wheels, MP3 playback capabilities, and optional front heated seats. The LTZ was the most luxurious model. It offered leather seating surfaces that were heated, an AM/FM stereo with six-disc CD/MP3 changer in the dash and a Bose eight-speaker premium sound system, a power sunroof, security system, and OnStar. The SS was the top-of-the-line model until 2009. It offered a 5.3L V8 engine, leather-and-suede seating surfaces, eighteen-inch machined-finished alloy wheels, and SS badging. Due to its unpopularity, the SS trim was discontinued in 2009, leaving the LTZ as the top-of-the-line model for 2010. In 2007, the Impala received the FlexFuel 3.5-liter V-6 and Flex Fuel rear badge for the LS, LT, LTZ, & Touring. A new 3.9-liter V-6 with Active Fuel Management was available. The SS retained the same drivetrain and did not receive the FlexFuel feature due to the high-performance nature of the powertrain. A tire-pressure-monitoring system, cruise control and a CD player were standard on all models, and a factory spoiler was an available option. The LT had 16-inch, five-spoke alloy wheels. The generation-7 OnStar system with turn-by-turn navigation was included when the available directions and connections service was selected. The SS had standard leather-appointed seats and XM Satellite Radio, with XM being optional on LS, LT, and LTZ trims. A new Luxury Edition package featuring leather seating, folding rear seat, and rear spoiler was offered on the LT. There were four new exterior colors—Precisions Red, Imperial Blue Metallic, Bordeaux Red, and Red Jewel Tintcoat, as well as a Regency-outfitted "Impala RSS". The RSS included aggressive wheels, front/rear bumper and rocker panel extensions, a spoiler and various interior upgrades. To commemorate the Impala's 50th year, a 50th Anniversary Edition was introduced in Spring 2008. Based on the LT, it added a FE3 Sport Suspension (replacing the FE1 Touring Suspension), four-wheel ABS, eighteen-inch SS-style alloy wheels (replacing the 16-inch wheels), rear SS style spoiler, "50th Anniversary" Impala badges on the C-pillars, two-tone, leather-trimmed seats with "50th" logos embroidered on the front headrests, eight-way power-adjustable driver seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel with accent-color threading including audio controls, ebony carpet, ebony floor mats with accent threading, "50th" Anniversary emblems on the sill plates and a choice of two premium exterior colors: Black Granite Metallic and Red Jewel Tintcoat A Luxury Edition package was again available on the LT and now also featured leather-wrapped steering wheel, steering wheel mounted audio controls, traction control, and anti-lock brakes.   For the 2009 model year, the Impala received three new exterior colors: Victory Red, Silver Ice Metallic, and Aqua Blue Metallic, while the brushed aluminum dash applique was no longer available. All models used the previous SS style spoiler (actually phased in for the late 2008 model year). The Touring trim level was discontinued for 2009. Leather seating was no longer available in combination with the 40/20/40 split bench front seat. The Active Fuel Management feature remained on the 5.3L V8 with a 17-gallon gas tank for the SS model, but was no longer available on 3.9L V6 for the LT and LTZ models. A sun and wheel package was available on 1LT models included power sunroof, overhead console with Homelink and 17-inch aluminum wheels. A Bose Premium Audio System was now part of the Luxury Edition package offered on LT models. Thorax side-impact air bags were standard. For the 2010 model year, the Impala was the only GM W-body car in production, although the eight-cylinder SS model was discontinued. LT models included fog lights and once again offered an optional Luxury Edition package. The 3.9L V6 was no longer available for the LT model. Three new exterior colors were available: Summit White, Cyber Gray Metallic, and Aqua Blue Metallic, and four exterior colors were deleted. The (PDG) convenience package, AM/FM stereo with 6-disc in-dash CD changer, and trunk cargo net were no longer available. The Impala emblems on rear sail panels as well as the rear decklid badge on LS models were deleted. Early '10 models had the lower front-side GM badges but were also later deleted. For the 2011 model year, Impala returned in LS, LT, and LTZ trims. Available engines were a 3.5 L V6 (LS or LT) or a 3.9 L V6 (LTZ only). A Luxury Edition package was again an option on the LT and featured leather heated seats, 6-way power front passenger seat, Bose Premium Audio System, XM radio, auto-dimming rearview mirror, Universal Home Remote, outside heated power mirrors, and rear spoiler.  For the 2012 model year, the exterior received a slight refresh and 4 trims: a standard Impala, LS, LT, and LTZ. The 3.5 and 3.9 engines were dropped in favor of a single, 3.6 L LFX that delivers  and  of torque. The four-speed automatic transmission is also deleted in favor of a six-speed automatic. The Impala also received new packages, including the LS Uplevel package, LS OnStar and Bluetooth package, LT Sunroof package, LT OnStar package and the LT OnStar and Bluetooth package. For the 2013 model year, the Impala was largely a carryover of the 2012 model. Available trims were once again LS, LT, and LTZ. It was the last retail Impala to be offered with optional bench seat and column shift transmission. A Luxury Edition package, last seen on the 2011 model, returned as an option on the LT and featured perforated leather seating surfaces, dual front heated bucket seats with driver's side 8-way and passenger's side 6-way power adjusters, inside rearview auto-dimming mirror, Universal Home Remote, outside heated power adjustable mirrors, Bose 8-speaker premium sound system, six-disc in-dash CD changer that played MP3 and WMA files, with Radio Data System, Sirius-XM satellite radio, and iPod and USB inputs, as well as an auxiliary input. Due to the early release of the redesigned 2014 model, the 2013 Impala had an abbreviated model year.  The 9C1 and 9C3 models were based on the LS model, yet offered steel wheels or steel wheels with wheel covers, optional rubber flooring, preparation for police equipment such as sirens, radios, and lighting, special badging, and inoperable rear door handles, windows, and door locks. It also came with the option for a rear vinyl bench seat and front cloth bucket or bench seats, both cloth front and rear seats, or vinyl front and rear seats. It also offered preparation for a criminal cage to be installed between the front and rear seats. The foglamps seen on the LT, LTZ, & SS were optional in 2008 & stayed as an option until 2012 which did away with that option. The 9C1 & 9C3 also had the option of having the spoiler seen on the LT, & LTZ until being replaced by the spoiler that is on the SS & other models in 2009. The police sedans received the FlexFuel in 2008 feature to compete against the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, which also received a similar feature allowing it to utilize E85. Also updated were the 9C1 and 9C3 trim levels for the Police Package models, which did not have the civilian SS's  V8 engine, but used the 3.9 liter (237 cu in) V6.[ ] Police Sedans utilized the SS radiator and cooling system as an upgrade from the standard 3.9 liter engine (used in the Impala LTZ). GM did not wish to design a specific radiator and cooling system to equip a low-production V8 police vehicle. Also, the heavy-duty steel wheels were not redesigned, and as such, the Police Sedan used the original center caps or the older style wheel covers from the 8th generation model. The 9C1 and 9C3 were equipped with an external trunk lock tumbler starting in 2008. Neither feature was available for the civilian version of the car. The 9C1 and 9C3 police models had the standard wood grain for the 2006 model year until 2007 which was replaced by an aluminized interior trim. For the 2012 model year both the 9C1 & 9C3 have different end caps where the fog lamps are on the LT & LTZ trims on the front end bumper, received 17-inch wheels with new wheel covers, and the same LFX V6 that powers the civilian Impala. The Caprice PPV will succeed the Impala 9C1 when it concludes production in 2016. Until then, the Caprice and 9C1 will be offered simultaneously. The ninth generation model remains in production in LS, LT, and LTZ trim until 2016 as a rental, fleet, and police car only under the revised model name Impala Limited. The consolidated plant in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada will continue making the Impala Limited, along with the Chevrolet Equinox. The tenth-generation Impala was introduced at the 2012 New York Auto Show for the 2014 model year, with sales and production commencing March 4, 2013. The tenth generation Impala was the first American sedan in 20 years to earn Consumer Reports’ top score, with a score of 95 of a possible 100 points. This tenth generation Impala was built larger (once again considered full-size) and more upscale than the previous generation (sharing the extended Epsilon II FWD platform with the Cadillac XTS) to reduce price overlap between Impala and Malibu, similar to how the Ford Taurus and Ford Fusion are positioned in Ford's lineup. The current versions are being assembled in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, alongside the ninth-generation Impala (now renamed the fleet and rental exclusive-only Impala Limited), and at the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly in the United States All trim levels are equipped with a six-speed automatic transmission with sport and manual shifting modes. The tenth generation models were shipped to dealerships across North America on March 25, 2013, and officially went on sale to the public April 1, 2013."GM's 2014 Chevrolet Impala headed to dealerships" from The Denver Post (March 27, 2013) That same day regular production on the Impala (the 2.4L eAssist and 3.6L equipped versions/LT2 and LTZ2 trims only) began at their Oshawa plant,"2014 Chevrolet Impala Production Begins Today in Oshawa" from Motor Trend (April 1, 2013) while production at GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant (the 2.5L equipped versions/LS, LT1 and LTZ1 trims) started production on April 8 and arrived to dealerships in May.

Five new colors are introduced: Siren Red Tintcoat, Citron Green Metallic, Heather Gray Metallic, Mosaic Black Metallic, and Green Envy Metallic; six colors were dropped: Autumn Bronze, Red Rock, Crystal Red Tintcoat, Ashen Gray, Silver Topaz, and Champagne Silver. The Jet Black/Brownstone interior color scheme was dropped. 2016 models also came equipped with a new 800 cold-cranking amps battery, replacing the 900 CCA. Wireless charging for devices, front and rear splash guards, as well as lane change alert were added. The CD player was now only offered as standard equipment on the LTZ, but available as an option on other trims as part of the Technology package."2016 Chevy Impala Gets A Bevy Of Changes And A Few Updates" from GM Authority (April 21, 2015) 2016 also saw the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Capability features; only one phone brand at any one time can be used."Apple CarPlay's coming to these 14 Chevrolet cars in the 2016 model year" from PC World (May 27, 2015)"These are the 14 Chevrolet cars from the 2016 model year that will have Android Auto" from PC World (May 27, 2015) In addition to the "OnStar/Connections Plan" being rebranded as the "Guidance Plan", the 2016 Impala's option packages were rebranded: The 2015 Chevrolet Impala Bi-Fuel runs on CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) and Gasoline. Unveiled in October 2013 by General Motors CEO Dan Akerson. The Bi-Fuel Impala would be offered to both fleet customers and retail. It is the only full-size CNG vehicle manufactured in North America. The new Impala will join the Honda Civic as a rare CNG car to come straight from a major automaker and available for retail sales. The 2015 Chevrolet Impala Bi-Fuel has a 500-mile driving range. It will allow the driver to switch from Gasoline to CNG or from CNG to Gasoline at the push of a button. The CNG tank is placed in the trunk.The Impala Bi-Fuel was one of the five finalists for the 2015 Green Car of the Year Award during the 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show, but lost to the BMW i3. On July 31, 2015, Chevrolet announced that the Impala will go on sale in South Korea as an export vehicle for the 2016 model year, marking the first time that Chevrolet has offered an American-built full size sedan in the Korean market."2016 Chevrolet Impala Exported To South Korea" from GM Authority (July 31, 2015) With the launching of the next generation Buick LaCrosse in 2016 as a 2017 model, Chevrolet will move the next generation Impala to the same P2XX platform in 2017 as a 2018 model. In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's crash tests, the 2000 to 2005 Impala was given a "Good" rating overall for good structural performance and no chance of any significant injury in a crash of its severity, except for maybe a minor lower left leg injury, such as a bruise or sprain. The 2006 to present Impala is given a lesser overall "Acceptable" score for front impact collisions. and a "Good" score for side impacts. Side curtain airbags are standard for front and rear rows; side torso airbags previously unavailable became standard on all trim levels beginning with the 2009 model year. GM made some minor structural enhancements to the Impala, beginning in December 2009; models produced after that received a "Good" in the IIHS frontal offset crash test. In September 2009, a local news station's investigative team in Rhode Island discovered that GM's fleet customers who purchased the 2006–2009 Impala were able to order them with the side-curtain airbags deleted for a savings of $175 per vehicle. Because these fleets typically sell off their cars after two to three years of use, many of the Impalas that were built without side-curtains have gone on to become privately owned cars. Current owners may be able to tell if their car has side airbags by checking the VIN and/or by checking to see if "Air bag" is printed on the roof support between the front and back rows. Another potential safety hazard, affecting Impalas of model years 2007 and 2008, is premature rear tire wear caused by defective rear suspension components. Police vehicles were upgraded to correct this defect and law enforcement agencies were compensated for expenses incurred for tire replacement, but civilian vehicles were not recalled. As a result, Impala owners launched a class action lawsuit in July 2011 against General Motors.[ ] In response, the current General Motors leadership claimed about a month later that they are not responsible to repair the defective vehicles manufactured pre-General Motors Bailout. Subsequently, in late September, a new lawsuit, disputing the GM response, was initiated by three of the estimated 400,000 Impala owners.http://www.detnews.com/article/20110927/AUTO01/109270375/1148/auto01/Impala-owners-sue-‘old’-GM-over-suspension-problems  (GM is also facing a similar legal dispute regarding a pre-bankruptcy upgrade to its OnStar system which left thousands of users without service in violation of their paid-up contracts.) On April 22, 2014, the NHTSA opened an investigation into 60,000 2014 Chevrolet Impala models over concerns relating to the sedan's emergency braking system. This comes after it received a complaint from a driver who experienced "inappropriate activation of the emergency braking system," adding it "alleges that the driver assist system inappropriately activated emergency braking bringing the vehicle to a complete stop under what the driver considered to be full braking force." The driver also went on to say that it heard three to four beeps from the system while driving the rented vehicle, which had only 2500 miles on it. GM is fully co-operating in the investigation."2014 Chevy Impala being investigated over braking issue" from Autoblog (April 22, 2014) Motor Trend magazine awarded the full-size Chevrolet including the Impala as its 1977 Car of the Year.Motor Trend: Car of the Year-February 1977 Automotive Fleet and Business Fleet magazines awarded the Impala the 2006, 2007, and 2008 Fleet Car of the Year.cite web|http://www.automotive-fleet.com/Article/Story/2007/12/Chevrolet-Sweeps-2008-Fleet-Car-Truck-of-the-Year.aspx Canadian Automobile Association (CAA) selected the Impala for its 2006 Pyramid Award for Environmental Initiatives for the launch of its new ethanol-powered E-85 model.  In 2007, the Impala began to replace the Monte Carlo on the NASCAR stock car racing circuit; more specifically, on all the scheduled racing events where NASCAR has mandated the use of a car with different (and some) new specifications, better known as the Car of Tomorrow. The Impala was also used to represent Chevrolet in the Nationwide Series.
