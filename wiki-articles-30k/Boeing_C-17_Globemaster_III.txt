 The Boeing C-17 Globemaster III is a large military transport aircraft.  It was developed for the United States Air Force (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by McDonnell Douglas. The C-17 carries forward the name of two previous piston-engined military cargo aircraft, the Douglas C-74 Globemaster and the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II. The C-17 commonly performs strategic airlift missions, transporting troops and cargo throughout the world; additional roles include tactical airlift, medical evacuation and airdrop duties. Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in the 1990s, continued to manufacture C-17s for export customers following the end of deliveries to the U.S. Air Force. Aside from the United States, the C-17 is in service with the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, NATO Heavy Airlift Wing, India, and Kuwait. The final C-17 was completed at the Long Beach, California plant and flown on 29 November 2015.[ ] Boeing, 29 November 2015. In the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force began looking for a replacement for its Lockheed C-130 Hercules tactical cargo aircraft."Air Force Lets Advanced STOL Prototype Work." Wall Street Journal, 13 November 1972.  The Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) competition was held, with Boeing proposing the YC-14, and McDonnell Douglas proposing the YC-15.Miles, Marvin. "McDonnell, Boeing to Compete for Lockheed C-130 Successor." Los Angeles Times, 11 November 1972.  Though both entrants exceeded specified requirements, the AMST competition was canceled before a winner was selected. The Air Force started the C-X program in November 1979 to develop a larger AMST with longer range to augment its strategic airlift.Kennedy 2004, pp. 3–20, 24.  By 1980, the USAF found itself with a large fleet of aging C-141 Starlifter cargo aircraft. Compounding matters, USAF needed increased strategic airlift capabilities to fulfill its rapid-deployment airlift requirements. The USAF set mission requirements and released a request for proposals (RFP) for C-X in October 1980. McDonnell Douglas elected to develop a new aircraft based on the YC-15; Boeing bid an enlarged three-engine version of its AMST YC-14. Lockheed submitted two designs, a C-5-based design and an enlarged C-141 design. On 28 August 1981, McDonnell Douglas was chosen to build its proposed aircraft, then designated C-17. Compared to the YC-15, the new aircraft differed in having swept wings, increased size, and more powerful engines.Norton 2001, pp. 12–13.  This would allow it to perform the work done by the C-141, and also fulfill some of the duties of the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, freeing the C-5 fleet for outsize cargo. Alternate proposals were pursued to fill airlift needs after the C-X contest.  These were lengthening of C-141As into C-141Bs, ordering more C-5s, continued purchases of KC-10s, and expansion of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.  Limited budgets reduced program funding, requiring a delay of four years.  During this time contracts were awarded for preliminary design work and for the completion of engine certification.  In December 1985, a full-scale development contract was awarded."Douglas Wins $3.4B Pact to Build C-17." Los Angeles Times, 3 January 1986.  At this time, first flight was planned for 1990.Norton 2001, pp. 13, 15.  The Air Force had formed a requirement for 210 aircraft.Kennedy 2004, pp. 70, 81–83. Development problems and limited funding caused delays in the late 1980s.Kennedy, Betty Raab. "Historical Realities of C-17 Program Pose Challenge for Future Acquisitions." Institute for Defense Analyses, December 1999.  Criticisms were made of the developing aircraft and questions were raised about more cost-effective alternatives during this time.Fuller, Richard L.

Congressional Research Service, 5 June 2007.  Two complete airframes were built for static and repeated load testing.Norton 2001, pp. 25–26, 28. A static test of the C-17 wing in October 1992 resulted in the wing failing at 128% of design limit load, which was below the 150% requirement.  Both wings buckled rear to the front and failures occurred in stringers, spars and ribs."Technical Assessment Report; C-17 Wing Structural Integrity." Department of Defense, 24 August 1993.

A July 1994 GAO document revealed that Air Force and DoD studies from 1986 and 1991 stated the C-17 could use 6,400 more runways outside the U.S. than the C-5; it was discovered that these studies only considered runway dimensions, but not runway strength or Load Classification Numbers (LCN). The C-5 has a lower LCN, but the USAF classifies both in the same broad Load Classification Group (LCG). When considering runway dimensions and load ratings, the C-17's worldwide runway advantage over the C-5 shrank from 6,400 to 911 airfields."Comparison of C-5 and C-17 Airfield Availability." United States General Accounting Office, July 1994. The C-17's ability to use low quality, austere airfields was not considered. A January 1995 GAO report revealed that, over the original cost of $41.8 billion for 210 C-17s, the 120 aircraft on order were costing $39.5 billion."C-17 Aircraft – Cost and Performance Issues." United States General Accounting Office, January 1995.  In March 1994, the U.S. Army decided it did not need the  Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES) delivery with the C-17 and that the C-130's  capability was sufficient; C-17 testing was limited to this lower weight. Airflow issues prevented the C-17 from meeting airdrop requirements.

The size and weight of U.S. mechanized firepower and equipment have grown in recent decades from increased air mobility requirements, particularly for large or heavy non-palletized outsize cargo. The C-17 is powered by four Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100 turbofan engines, which are based on the commercial Pratt and Whitney PW2040 used on the Boeing 757.  Each engine is rated at 40,400&nbsp;lbf (180&nbsp;kN) of thrust. The engine's thrust reversers direct engine exhaust air upwards and forward, reducing the chances of foreign object damage by ingestion of runway debris, and providing enough reverse thrust to back the aircraft up on the ground while taxiing. The thrust reversers can also be used in flight at idle-reverse for added drag in maximum-rate descents. In vortex surfing tests performed by C-17s, up to 10% fuel savings were reported.Drinnon, Roger. "'Vortex surfing' could be revolutionary." U.S. Air Force, 11 October 2012.

The cargo compartment is 88 feet (26.82 m) long by 18 feet (5.49 m) wide by 12 feet 4&nbsp;inches (3.76 m) high. The cargo floor has rollers for palletized cargo but it can be flipped to provide a flat floor suitable for vehicles and other rolling stock. Cargo is loaded through a large aft ramp that accommodates rolling stock, such as a 69-ton (63-metric ton) M1 Abrams main battle tank, other armored vehicles, trucks, and trailers, along with palletized cargo.  Maximum payload of the C-17 is 170,900&nbsp;lb (77,500&nbsp;kg), and its Maximum takeoff weight is 585,000&nbsp;lb (265,350&nbsp;kg). With a payload of 160,000&nbsp;lb (72,600&nbsp;kg) and an initial cruise altitude of 28,000&nbsp;ft (8,500 m), the C-17 has an unrefueled range of about 2,400 nautical miles (4,400&nbsp;km) on the first 71 aircraft, and 2,800 nautical miles (5,200&nbsp;km) on all subsequent extended-range models that include a sealed center wing bay as a fuel tank. Boeing informally calls these aircraft the C-17 ER."C-17/C-17 ER Flammable Material Locations." Boeing, 1 May 2005. The C-17's cruise speed is about 450 knots (833&nbsp;km/h) (Mach 0.74).

In the light of Airbus A400M delays, the UK Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, announced in May 2000 that the RAF would lease four C-17s at an annual cost of £100 million from Boeing for an initial seven years with an optional two-year extension. The RAF had the option to buy or return the aircraft to Boeing. The UK committed to upgrading its C-17s in line with the USAF so that if they were returned, the USAF could adopt them.  The first C-17 was delivered to the RAF at Boeing's Long Beach facility on 17 May 2001 and flown to RAF Brize Norton by a crew from No. 99 Squadron. The RAF's fourth C-17 was delivered on 24 August 2001. The RAF aircraft were some of the first to take advantage of the new center wing fuel tank found in Block 13 aircraft. In RAF service, the C-17 has not been given an official service name and designation (for example, C-130J referred to as Hercules C4 or C5), but is referred to simply as the C-17 or "C-17A Globemaster". The RAF declared itself delighted with the C-17.
