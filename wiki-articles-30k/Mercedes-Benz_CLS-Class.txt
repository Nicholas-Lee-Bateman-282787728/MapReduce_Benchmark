  The Mercedes-Benz CLS is a four-door mid-size luxury coupe originally launched in 2004 and based on the W211 E-Class and was internally designated as the W219. The second generation CLS-Class was introduced in September 2010 and production started in the beginning of 2011. The CLS slots above the E-Class and below the S-Class. The CLS marked Mercedes-Benz's return to the executive-size coupe market since the (W124) E-Class Coupe (a two-door sedan) went out of production in 1995. The (W210) E-Class did not spawn a coupe variant, as Mercedes-Benz chose instead to introduce a smaller coupe based on the compact C-Class, the CLK-Class. However, the CLK-Class was built with a lengthened C-Class wheelbase so it could be slotted as a mid-sized vehicle, and it also featured styling cues, engines, and similar pricing to the (W210) E-Class to give the impression that the (W124) E-Class Coupe had been directly replaced. Marketed as a four-door coupe, the CLS was designed by the American automotive designer, Michael Fink in 2001 (born 1967), who styled the first CLK, the C-Sportcoupe, and is known as the stylist who penned the Maybach 57 and 62. According to a Mercedes-Benz press release, the CLS-class was produced to combine the "strong, emotive charisma" of a coupe with the "comfort and practicality" of a sedan. Save for its four-door design, the CLS's design tends towards a coupe, as its sleek roofline reduces the rear passenger room to a 2+2 arrangement, and it offers a smaller selection of engines tending towards high powered of the range, compared to contemporary sedans such as the E-Class. The first generation of the CLS, the Mercedes-Benz W219, was based on a six inches (152&nbsp;mm) longer version of the W211 E-Class platform. IVM Automotive, a subsidiary of German roof system specialist Edscha, developed the entire vehicle from the Vision concept to the production version. More than 150 IVM engineers were involved, making the CLS the largest vehicle development project in the company's history. Design patents were first filed on July 24, 2002.  The production version CLS 500 made its debut at the 2004 New York International Auto Show, as well as the 2004 Bologna Motor Show. European models went on sale in 2004. United States went on sale in January 2005, initially including CLS 500 and CLS 55 AMG. The first one for the export markets rolled off the assembly line on December 2, 2004.  In 2006, Mercedes phased out both the 5.0L in the CLS 500 and 5.5L Supercharged V8 in the CLS 55 AMG in favor of two new 5.5L and 6.2L V8s. This resulted in the 2007 model year name change to the CLS 63 AMG (6.2L V8) and CLS 550 (5.5L V8) in the United States. The CLS 500 badge continues to be used in various markets with the 5.5L V8 engine. The 2012 CLS 550 had a base price of US$72,175 in June 2011 (equivalent to £ today), with the CLS 55 starting at US$87,320. The 2012 CLS63 started at $96,775 (equivalent to £ today), for a base model, and is offered with steering wheel mounted paddles (F1 style), and 19" wheels for the US market.  It is a concept vehicle with six-cylinder twin turbo diesel engine rated  and , 7G-TRONIC seven-speed automatic transmission, Active Light System from Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W 211), electrohydraulic brake system from Mercedes-Benz SL (R 230), dashboard and A-pillars upholstered in leather, soft leather upholstery at seats and door panels, oak veneer, glass roof, 470 liters trunk capacity, adaptive front airbags, window bags and side airbags, belt tensioners with adaptive belt force limiters, The vehicle was unveiled in 2003 Frankfurt International Motor Show.Mercedes-Benz Concept Vehicles – the Shape of the FutureMercedes premiere Vision CLS coupe study at Frankfurt2003 Mercedes-Benz Vision CLS Concept Boldride.com - Pictures, Wallpapers  The CLS 55 AMG and CLS 63 AMG are modified versions of the CLS produced by Mercedes-AMG.
