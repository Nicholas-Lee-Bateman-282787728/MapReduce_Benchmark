   Usher Terry Raymond IV (born October 14, 1978) known mononymously as Usher, is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actor. Born in Dallas, but raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee was where he lived until moving to Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 12 where his mother put him in local singing competiitons all over the city. At one of these competitions is where he would catch the eye of a music A&R from LaFace Records. In August 1994 he released his self-titled debut album, Usher with the lead singles "Can U Get Wit It" and "Think of You". He rose to fame in the late 1990s with the release of his second album My Way (1997), which spawned his first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit, "Nice & Slow". The album has been certified 6-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). My Way also earned Usher his first Grammy Award nomination for his debut single "You Make Me Wanna" that reached number-one on the Rhythmic Top 40, Hot Dance Singles Sales, and US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop charts. His follow-up album, 8701, produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "U Remind Me" and "U Got It Bad". Also from this album "U Don't Have to Call" won Usher his second consecutive Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2003. Usher's 2004 album, Confessions, established him as one of the best-selling musical artists of the 2000s decade. It sold over 20 million copies worldwide, bolstered by its four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number one songs  — "Yeah!", "Burn", "Confessions Part II", and "My Boo"  — and has been certified diamond by the RIAA. His follow-ups, Here I Stand (2008) and Raymond v. Raymond (2010), debuted atop the Billboard 200 and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Love in This Club" and "OMG". A follow-up EP, Versus, was released in July 2010 and produced the successful track "DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love". His seventh studio album, Looking 4 Myself (2012), debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200 chart. The RIAA ranks Usher as one of the best-selling artists in American music history, having sold over 23.8 million albums and 38.2 million digital songs in the United States alone. To date, he has sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artist. Usher has won numerous awards including eight Grammy Awards. At the end of 2009, Usher was named the number one Hot 100 artist of the 2000s decade.[ ] Billboard named him the second most successful artist of the 2000s decade,[ ]   with his 2004 album Confessions being ranked as the top solo album of the 2000s decade.[ ]   Billboard also placed Usher at number six on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years.  Usher has attained nine Hot 100 number-one singles. Usher was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Jonetta Patton (née O'Neal) from Tennessee and Usher Raymond III. Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old; there, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally. In the belief that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers. While in Atlanta, Usher attended North Springs High School. Usher's father died of a heart attack on January 21, 2008. At age 10, Usher joined an R&B local quintet called the NuBeginnings, which was organized by local music svengali, Darryl Wheeler. Usher recorded 10 songs with the group in 1991, and the ensuing album, Nubeginning Featuring Usher Raymond IV, was only made available regionally and by mail order. However, Patton took him out because, according to her, it was a "bad experience". The album was re-released nationally in April 2002 by Hip-O Records. At age 13, Usher competed on Star Search, where he was spotted by an A&R representative from LaFace Records, who arranged an audition for Usher with L.A. Reid, the co-founder of LaFace; Reid signed Usher on the spot to a contract with the record company after singing Boyz II Men hit record "End of the Road" . Usher's mother left her job as a medical technician to manage his career, but later broke up their relationship as manager-client in May 2007. Usher was introduced on "Call Me a Mack", a song he recorded for the soundtrack album to the 1993 drama-romance film Poetic Justice. During this time period is where young Usher first met Chilli, his label mate who he would later date down the road. Preparing for his debut album the unthinkable thing happens to Usher and he loses his voice. Usher was going through puberty and having a difficult time adjusting his voice. LA Reid became skeptical of Usher and put his recording on hold thinking about dropping him from the label. Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and L.A. Reid did. From this point Reid didn't know what to do with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with Puff Daddy to attend what Reid called "Flavor Camp". Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy. On August 30, 1994, LaFace released Usher's self-titled debut album. Sean "P Diddy" Combs produced several of the tracks and co-executive produced the album. Usher peaked at number twenty-five on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was accompanied by three singles: "Can U Get wit It", "Think of You", and "The Many Ways". The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date. The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex which the public had a hard time believing coming out of a 14-year-old's mouth. Again the LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn't as successful as they anticipated. At this time Jonetta Patton, Usher's mother took control of his career and put him in more talent shows the summer of 1995 building Usher a larger fan base and ultimately putting more confidence in L.A. Reid. After graduating from high school, Usher continued to develop his skills as a stage performer and laid the groundwork for his second album. He also appeared on their version of "Let's Straighten It Out", a 1995 duet with fellow Atlanta teen recording artist Monica; and on "Dreamin'", from LaFace's 1996 Olympic Games benefit album Rhythm of the Games. He was also featured on "I Swear I'm In Love" off the 1996 Kazaam soundtrack. Usher developed a friendship with American record producer, Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, My Way, released on September 16, 1997. The album's lead single, "You Make Me Wanna...", reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher's first record to be top single; the record led to his popularity reaching in the country.   It also became Usher's first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States. The album's second single, "Nice & Slow", peaked in January 1998 at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single. Later in February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America; My Way has been certified six-time platinum in the United States. "You Make Me Wanna" won the Best Male R&B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards. In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy's No Way Out tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope Tour. Usher's first concert album, Live, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil' Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States. Usher made his acting debut on the UPN television series Moesha, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty. Usher's extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year as he was cast in the soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful. He completed two more films, She's All That, and his first starring role in Light It Up. He also appeared in the Disney TV movie "Geppetto". Usher's third studio album, originally titled All About U, was slated to be released in early 2001.  The first single, "Pop Ya Collar", was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States. The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. After having revised and renamed to 8701, the album was released August 7, 2001 (8.7.01). The first two singles "U Remind Me" and "U Got It Bad" each topped the Billboard Hot&nbsp;100 for four and six weeks, respectively. 8701 has been certified four-time platinum in the United States. Usher appeared in the 2001 film Texas Rangers. In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for 'Best Male R&B Vocal Performance' for "U Remind Me". The next year, he won the same award for "U Don't Have to Call", making Usher the only artist aside from Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder to win this award consecutively. In summer 2002, Usher contributed vocals to P. Diddy's "I Need a Girl, Part I". The year closed out with a trio of TV series appearances, all in November, on The Twilight Zone, 7th Heaven, Moesha, and American Dreams, the latter in which Usher portrayed Marvin Gaye. Usher's fourth studio album, Confessions, was released on March 23, 2004—just as its first single, "Yeah!", was in its sixth week at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifth week on top of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Chart. The album's nearly 1.1&nbsp;million unit debut sales was the highest first-week numbers ever scanned by a male R&B artist and the seventh best of the Nielsen SoundScan history. To date, the album has accumulated sales of over 20 million copies worldwide, over 10&nbsp;million of which were sold in the United States, earning the album a Diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album's second and third singles, "Burn" and "Confessions Part II", also topped the Billboard Hot&nbsp;100, the former for eight weeks. Usher became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay with four consecutive number-one singles, In September 2004, "My Boo", a duet with American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys, also peaked at number one at the Billboard Hot&nbsp;100, becoming the album's fourth number-one single. In December, the album's final single "Caught Up" peaked at number eight on the Hot 100. Confessions earned Usher numerous awards, including four American Music Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. At the 47th annual Grammy Awards ceremony in 2005, Usher won three awards, including: R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals for "My Boo", which he shared with Keys; Rap/Sung Collaboration for "Yeah!"; and Contemporary R&B Album for Confessions. At the 2004 Billboard Music Awards, Usher was recognized Artist of the Year, in addition to receiving 10 other accolades. Usher supported Confessions with the "The Truth Tour". The tour set featured a small stage up on top of the main stage, where the band played with Usher and his supporting dancers left with enough room to perform. The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it which lowered to the main stage and had two big staircases on both sides of it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, there was a fire escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West and [[Christina Milian]] was the opening act for the tour.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Usher Proves He's 'The Truth' At Tour Kickoff|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/1490004/usher-proves-hes-the-truth-at-tour-kickoff/|website = MTV News|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}</ref> Usher at select dates would bring out special guest, during his Atlanta show taping he brought out his artist at the time [[Rico Love]] to rap a verse on the song "Throwback".

His last act, Michelle Chamuel, lost the winning title to Danielle Bradbery, mentored by Blake Shelton. He returned for the sixth season and his last act, Josh Kaufman, won. Usher also appeared on the 37th annual 4 July Fireworks show sponsored by Macy's and was aired on NBC with a special soundtrack designed for the show featuring four of his very own songs. On March 19, 2013, Usher made initial notice of his eighth studio album, titled UR, was being in the works. Talking to The Fader, he described the album as "everything you can imagine", saying that it's "gonna be freaking out of here". In an interview with singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger by Rap-Up, the former explained that he, along with Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Brian Alexander Morgan, was working on Usher's next album. Bellinger compared the album's music to Usher's Confessions (2004), saying that it is "more R&B, more urban" than Usher's Looking 4 Myself. The latter declared that his next album would show that he is "still Usher". "Good Kisser", a dance-heavy throwback R&B track, was released as the first single. Produced by Pop & Oak, it was performed at The Voice. Since then, two other singles have been released from the album: "She Came to Give It to You" featuring Nicki Minaj and "I Don't Mind" featuring Juicy J. On August 25, 2014 Usher announced his UR Experience Tour in support of his then-titled eighth studio album UR. The UR Experience kicked off in Montreal, Quebec on Nov. 1 and closed in Tampa, FL. on Dec. 14. The 27 city North American leg was supported by opening acts DJ Cassidy and R&B newcomer August Alsina. The European leg of the tour visited 23 cities and the support would be Nico & Vinz. "With The UR Experience, I want to give my fans an ever-changing live show full of surprises and special guests," Usher says, via a press release. "I am really excited to be with my fans and give them an Usher experience like they've never seen or heard before." On January 14, 2016, after continual delays of his eighth album, Usher announced via Twitter that he changed the title of the album from UR to Flawed.  It is scheduled to be released in late 2016.  Usher has a leggero tenor vocal range. When speaking of Usher's vocal range, Rick Juzwiak speaks "his vocal range is even more impressive than his emotional one" with emphasis on his falsetto being "something that sounds as natural as a speaking voice...he's the picture of grace against shrieking synths". Juzwiak emphasizes the singer's expressiveness by commenting "his emotional range is vast enough to sell tenderness, lechery and wistfulness within minutes of each other'. Usher's music is generally R&B, but he also incorporates pop, dance and hip hop into his songs. With the albums Raymond vs. Raymond and Looking 4 Myself, he expanded into electropop and dance pop. Known for his R&B songs, Usher expanded his appeal and range by collaborating with Latin and dance artists like Pitbull, Romeo Santos, and David Guetta. Much of Usher's music after Confessions has an autobiographical nature with emphasis of lifestyle, relationships and love. On many occasions, Usher has named Michael Jackson as his biggest influence. Usher once told MTV, "He influenced me in so many ways, more than just music ..... as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn't be who I am today without Michael Jackson." During the television special 'Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special', Usher was able to dance with Michael while performing "You Rock My World". In addition to Jackson, he has spoken of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder as great musicians and philanthropists stating that "they figured out what they were as they were going, by inspiration as well...allowing their music to speak to where they were and what they had to say". Other influences include Janet Jackson, R. Kelly, Luther Vandross, and Bobby Brown. Usher is a staunch fan of art and also supports feminism. In 2014 December, he attended Art Basel Miami and participated in an art installation at JJ Brine’s VECTOR Gallery at Select Fair by performance artist Lena Marquise “Body As Commodity” during which she offered collectors to purchase 10 minutes of energy for $100. The news of the participation became the #1 reported on event of Art Basel Though Usher refused to issue any official statements about his participation, many assume his participation has to do with support for art and feminism due to the topic and tone of Usher's recent release at the time of song “I Don’t Mind” featuring Juicy J which talks about supporting the work of an exotic dancer, hinting at his support for the new wave of feminism. Usher founded vanity record label US Records, in 2002. The label is a subsidiary of Clive Davis's J Records, which is distributed by Sony BMG. The first album released by US Records was the soundtrack to In the Mix in late 2005, which was used to introduce the label's acts, such as rapper Rico Love, Canadian teen R&B artist Justin Bieber, and R&B vocal quartet composed of Jon A. Gordon, Michael A. Gordon, Courtney Vantrease, and Robert Brent p/k/a One Chance, and singer Rayan. Usher served as songwriter-producer in the project. The Raymond Braun Media Group, which Justin Bieber is signed up to, is a joint venture between Usher and Bieber's manager, Scooter Braun.  Aside from recording music, Usher is involved in other businesses, including several restaurants. Usher is a part owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers professional basketball team. He is part of a group which bought the team with a reported total purchase price of $375&nbsp;million. He became the third pop artist to own a large stake in an NBA team.  Usher served as the contestant mentor for the Top 10 Week of Season 9 of the television show American Idol. He appeared on the ITV1 show Britain's Got Talent on June 5, 2010. Recently Usher joined as a new coach of American reality talent show The Voice alongside Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Shakira for season 4, which premiered on March 25, 2013, on NBC. On March 30, 2015, it was announced that Usher is a co-owner, with various other music artists, in the music streaming service Tidal. The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music video with curated editorial.  Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.The slogan "Turn the tide" and the hashtag "#TIDALforAll" was used by various artists on social media during the buildup to the press conference relaunching the service. Usher, along with sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Alicia Keys, Kanye West, Beyonce, Rihanna, Madonna, J.Cole, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6509498/jay-z-tidal-launch-artist-stakeholders|title=It's Official: Jay Z's Historic Tidal Launches With 16 Artist Stakeholders|work=Billboard|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}</ref> The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties."The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/business/media/jay-z-reveals-plans-for-tidal-a-streaming-music-service.html|title=Jay Z Reveals Plans for Tidal, a Streaming Music Service|date=March 31, 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}</ref>  On June 28, 2015 Usher became partners with Yoobi the fast-growing school supplies company called based out of The Los Angeles.[https://corporate.target.com/article/2015/06/yoobi-usher-back-to-school] The company donates a portion of its products to schools and has brought in over $20 million in revenue between June 2014 and June 2015, CEO Ido Leffler tells Inc. exclusively.
