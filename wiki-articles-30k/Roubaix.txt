    Roubaix () is an old mono-industrial and working-class commune in northern France, in the department of Nord, which grew rapidly in the 19th century from its textile industries. This former new town is the second largest city in the French region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais ranked by population with about 95,000 inhabitants. Located between the cities of Lille and Tourcoing, Roubaix is the chef-lieu of two cantons. Together with Lille, Tourcoing, Villeneuve-d'Ascq and eighty-one other communes, Roubaix gives structure to a four-centred metropolitan area inhabited by around 1.1&nbsp;million people: the European Metropole of Lille. To a greater extent, Roubaix belongs to a vast conurbation formed with the Belgian cities of Menen, Mouscron, Kortrijk and Tournai, which gave birth to the first European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation in January 2008, Lille–Kortrijk–Tournai with an aggregate over 2 million inhabitants. Roubaix occupies a central position on the north-east slope of the European Metropole of Lille: it is set on the eastern side of Lille and the southern side of Tourcoing, close to the Belgian border. As regards towns' boundaries, Roubaix is encompassed by seven cities which constitute its immediate neighbouring environment. These municipalities are namely: Tourcoing to the north and the northwest, Wattrelos to the northeast, Leers to the east, Lys-lez-Lannoy to the southeast, Hem to the south and Croix to the southwest and the west. Roubaix, alongside those municipalities and twenty-one other communes, belongs to the land of Ferrain, a little district of the former Castellany of Lille between the Lys and Escaut rivers. As the crow flies, the distance between Roubaix and the following cities is some odd:  to Tournai,  to Kortrijk,  to Brussels and  to Paris. The soft hollow plain upon which Roubaix lies, stretches on the axis of an east-west oriented syncline which rises to the south and the southeast towards the Paleozoic limestone of the Mélantois-Tournaisis faulted anticline. This area consists predominantly of Holocene deposits of alluvial origin. It is flat and low, with an elevation drop of only  over its . The lowest altitude of this area stands at , while its highest altitude is  meters above the sea level. The Trichon stream fed by waters of the Espierre stream used to flow through the rural landscape of Roubaix before the industrialisation process began to alter this area in the middle of the 19th century. From that century on, the ensuing industries, with their increasing needs for reliable supplies of goods and water, led to the building of an inland waterway connected upstream from the Deûle and downstream to the Marque and Espierre toward the Escaut, which linked directly Roubaix to Lille. Opened in 1877, the Canal de Roubaix crosses the town from its northern neighbourhoods to its eastern neighbourhoods and flows along the city's boundaries. The Canal de Roubaix closed in 1985, after more than a century in use. Thank to the European funded project Blue Links, the waterway has been reopened to navigation since 2011. Despite some American statements that weather conditions in Roubaix were bad during the 19th century, the area of the city is not known for undergoing unusual weather events. In regard to the town's geographical location and the results of the Météo-France's weather station of Lille-Lesquin, Roubaix is a temperate oceanic climate: while summer experiences mild temperatures, winter's temperatures may fall to below zero. Precipitation is infrequently intense. The current city's name is most likely derived from two Frankish words: "raus" meaning reed and "baki" meaning brook. Thence the sense of Roubaix can probably find its origin in the brook's banks of Espierre, Trichon or Favreuil. The place was mentioned for the first time in a Latinised form in the 9th century: Villa Rusbaci. Thereafter, the following names were in use:  1047 and 1106 Rubais, 1122 Rosbays, 1166 Rusbais, 1156 and 1202 Robais, 1223 Roubais. Parallel to the official and usual name Roubaix, some translations are worth a mention. Firstly, though the city has never belonged to the Flemish-speaking area, the seldom-heard renderings Robeke and Roodebeeke are documented for Roubaix.  Furthermore, the Dutch Language Union established Robaais as the city's proper Dutch name. Lastly, one can cite Rosbacum as the definite Latin transcription of Roubaix which has been in use since the 19th century, as recorded on dedication statements sealed in the first stones of the foundations of the City Hall laid in 1840 and the Church of Notre Dame laid in 1842.   Inhabitants of Roubaix are known in English as "Roubaisians" and in French as Roubaisiens () or in the feminine form Roubaisiennes (), also natively called Roubaignos () or in the feminine form Roubaignoses ().   The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses carried out in the town since 1793 and the research study of Louis-Edmond Marissal, Clerk of the Peace of the city, published in 1844. From the 21st century, communes with more than 10,000 population have sample surveys held every year, unlike other municipalities that have a real census every five years.At the beginning of the 21st century, the terms of census have been amended by Act No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002, called "grassroots democracy law" on the democracy of proximity and in particular Title V "of census operations", in order, after a power transition period from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For municipalities with populations greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is carried out annually, the entire territory of these municipalities is included at the end of the same period of five years. The first post-legal population from 1999, and fitting in the new system which came into force on January 1, 2009, is the census of 2006.In the census table, by Wikipedia convention, the principle was retained for subsequent legal populations since 1999 not to display the census populations in the table corresponding to the year 2006, the first published legal population calculated according to the concepts defined in Decree No. 2003-485 of June 5, 2003, and the years corresponding to an exhaustive census survey for municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants, and the years 2006, 2011, 2016, etc.… for municipalities with more than 10,000. The latest legal population is published by INSEE for all municipalities.

By the late 18th century, the city began to emerge as regional textile manufacturing centre and its population increased, reaching a level of 8,091 in 1800. As a result of the industrialisation process of the 19th century, the need of workers was supplied by rural flight as well as immigration. Belgian settlement was a feature of the Roubaisian life at that time. During the first-half period of the 19th century, Roubaix ranked the first French town in terms of population growth rate with a five times increase, whereas in the remaining period of this century its population doubled. Within this last time framework, Belgian immigration appeared to be one of the major factor to explain the significantly high population growth, with 30,465 Belgian inhabitants counted in 1866 and 42,103 in 1872. Nonetheless, the rate of natural increase shew to be a more important component of the population growth in that period. At the 20th century threshold, the Roubaisian population reached a peak of 124,661, from which it progressively declined over the successive decades.

Over this occupation period, Roubaisians suffered from dearth, deportation for compulsory labour and unusual casualties with a rather slight population drop from 122,723 to 113,265 between the 1911 and 1921 censuses. The population of the city was 94,536 at the January 2012 census. This enables Roubaix to remain the second largest municipality in the region Nord-Pas de Calais. Although the region of Roubaix was subjected many times to the domination of Flanders' rulers throughout its history, Roubaisians have used a local Picard variant as the language of everyday life for centuries. This spoken vernacular is locally known as Roubaignot. Until the early 20th century this patois prevailed. Therefore, French language progressive penetration into local culture should not only be analysed as a result of the industrialisation and urbanisation of the area but should also be considered in terms of public education policies. In the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War and the German annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, many Jews left their homes and emigrated. Jewish arrival in Roubaix derives from that bitter period of history. At the time, the new immigrant community, even though its small size, dedicated a building to Jewish faith and liturgical practises. The newly opened synagogue, located in a house at number 51 on the narrow rue des Champs, operated more than 60 years, from 1877 to 1939 when it closed under imprecise local circumstances, while Nazi era arose in Europe. Despite the closure of the synagogue, the occupation and police raids, the local practise of Judaism saw an humble revival after the war which lasted until the start of the Nineties when the modest Jewry of Roubaix handed over its Sefer Torah to the care of the one of Lille. Roubaix has no longer been home to a Jewish place of worship since that event. The house inside which the first one was created 123 years ago, has been demolished since an urban renewal project occurred in 2000. On September 10, 2015, Guillaume Delbar, mayor of Roubaix, unveiled a commemorative plaque on the rue des Champs in memory of the religious purpose of this former building and the Roubaisian Jewry. As of August 2013 there were six mosques in the town, including one under construction. Three areas of the cemetery were designated for Muslims. According to estimates by the mayor's office, around 20,000 people, or about 20 percent of the population were Muslims. During the Middle Age, the city grew in a northward-facing semicircle around its primitive core, beyond the area spread out between the church Saint Martin and the former fortified castle. The existence of this south boundary remained until the 18th century and marked an urban expansion which mainly occurred on the western and northern sides of the town. Increasing industrialisation, land transport improvement, continued population growth and the resulting need for suitable low cost lands for housing and manufacturing plants, all of which finally led to expand the city southward from the centre, in the 19th century. Roubaix grouped four cantons from 1988 to 2012. Since then, this number has fell to two with Roubaix 1 and Roubaix 2. After the last redistricting of French legislative constituencies in 2010, the city is now divided into two constituencies : Nord's 7th constituency which include the former canton of Roubaix-Ouest and Nord's 8th constituency formed by the following former cantons: Roubaix-Centre, Roubaix-Nord and Roubaix-Est. Roubaix is twinned with: Remarkable buildings, old brick factories and warehouses abound in this once renowned city which was esteemed to be the worldwide textile capital in the early years of the 20th century. Thus, the city inherited one of the most architectural works in the French history and culture of the 19th century Industrial Revolution and was designated Town of Art and History on Decembre 13, 2000. Ever since the Ministry of Culture endowed Roubaix with this label, the city has entered the 21st century by promoting its cultural standing as the inheritance of its industrial and social history. Several profane or sacral buildings of Roubaix are registered as historic monuments.

From the end of the Second World War to the beginning of the seventies, a casual group of young artists from Roubaix and the surrounding region was formed and given the name . Two painters commonly associated with the group are  and . Roubaix has been home to two major museums of the region Nord-Pas de Calais since the beginning of the 21st century: La Piscine – André Diligent Museum of Art and Industry and La Manufacture – Museum-Workshop; inheriting both of the local socioeconomic history. The city of Roubaix was the filming location (mostly or partly) of the following films: Roubaix has an old sporting heritage and is home to the finishing of one of the world's oldest races of professional road cycling at its velodrome: Paris–Roubaix known as the Hell of the North. While Roubaix is famous for its velodrome, there is more to this city than the cycling sports facilities. The building of indoor and outdoor sports amenities in the city should be associated with its era of economic rise during the industrial revolution, in addition to the development of local sporting clubs and associations. During the 19th century, Roubaix acquired an international reputation for textile industry and wool production. In the Seventies and Eighties, international competition and automation caused an industrial decline and resulted in the closure of many factories. From that moment on and since the implementation of the French urban policy in the early Eighties, around three-fourth of the town's territory has been regularly assigned specific zoning designations as well as health and welfare plans. Successive local governments have tried to address difficulties associated with deindustrialisation by attracting new industries, making the most of the town's cultural credentials and organising a strong student presence on different campuses. Nevertheless, Roubaix's high level of unemployment remains and the town is listed first among France's poorest cities. Mail order companies of international renown such as La Redoute, Damart and 3 Suisses, stemmed from textile industries which were founded in Roubaix. OVH has established its head office in Roubaix since 1999. Ankama Games has established its head office in Roubaix since 2007. A22 autoroute, a French part of the European route E17 from Burgundy to Antwerp, is the only motorway, within a motorway roads network of the highest density in France after Paris, which passes by Roubaix. The Gare de Roubaix railway station offers connections to Antwerp, Lille, Ostend, Paris and Tourcoing. The city is also served by the Lille Metro.
