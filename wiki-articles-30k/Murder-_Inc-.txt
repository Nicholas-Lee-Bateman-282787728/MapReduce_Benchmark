  Murder, Inc. (or Murder Incorporated) was the name the press gave to organized crime groups in the 1930s through the 1940s that acted as the "enforcement arm" of the American Mafia, the early organized crime groups in New York and elsewhere.Carl Sifakis, The Mafia Encyclopedia. Checkmark Books, 2005. Page 13 The groups were composed of largely Italian-American and Jewish gangsters from the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brownsville, East New York, and Ocean Hill. Originally headed by Louis "Lepke" Buchalter, and later by Albert "The Mad Hatter" Anastasia, Murder, Inc. was believed to be responsible for between 400 and 1,000 contract killings,Wendy Ruderman, The Ice Pick Seems Antiquated, but It Still Shows Up on the Police Blotter, The New York Times, August 31, 2012 until the group was exposed in the early 1940s by  a former group member Abe "Kid Twist" Reles. In the trials that followed, many members were convicted and executed, and Abe Reles himself died after falling out of a window. Thomas E. Dewey first came to prominence as a prosecutor of Murder, Inc. and other organized crime cases. The Bugs and Meyer Mob was the predecessor to Murder, Incorporated. The gang was founded by New York Jewish American mobsters Meyer Lansky and Benjamin Siegel in the early 1920s. After the Castellammarese War and the assassination of U.S. Mafia boss Salvatore Maranzano, Italian mafioso Charles "Lucky" Luciano created the Commission. Soon after, Siegel and Lansky disbanded the Bugs and Meyer gang and formed Murder, Incorporated. Most of the killers were Italian and Jewish gangsters from the gangs of the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brownsville, East New York, and Ocean Hill. In addition to carrying out crime in New York City and acting as enforcers for New York Jewish mobster Louis "Lepke" Buchalter, they accepted murder contracts from mob bosses all around the United States. In his biography The Valachi Papers, Mafia turncoat Joe Valachi insisted Murder, Inc. did not commit crimes for the Mafia, but this is contradicted by other sources, and Albert Anastasia was also head of a Mafia crime family.Carl Sifakis, The Mafia Encyclopedia. Checkmark Books, 2005. Page 14 Based in part out of Rosie "Midnight Rose" Gold's candy store at corner of Saratoga and Livonia Ave in Brooklyn, Murder Inc. hit men used a wide variety of weapons, including ice picks, to murder their victims.Murder, Inc.: The Story Of The Syndicate by Burton B. Turkus, Sid Feder Though the group had a number of members, Harry "Pittsburgh Phil" Strauss was the most prolific killer, committing over 100 murders (some historians put the number as high as 500).NASA Report, The Mafia Encyclopedia. Checkmark Books, 2005. Page 360 The killers were paid a regular salary as retainer as well as an average fee of $1,000 to $5,000 per killing. Their families also received monetary benefits. If the killers were caught, the mob would hire the best lawyers for their defense. Murder, Inc. was established after the formation of the commission of the National Crime Syndicate, to which it ultimately answered. It was largely headed by mob boss Louis "Lepke" Buchalter and Mangano Family underboss Albert Anastasia, but also had members from Buchalter's labor-slugging gang (in partnership with Tommy "Three-Fingered Brown" Lucchese) as well as from another group of enforcers from Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York led by Martin "Buggsy" Goldstein and Abe "Kid Twist" Reles. Buchalter, in particular, and Joe Adonis occasionally, gave the outfit its orders from the board of directors of the syndicate. Albert "The Mad Hatter" Anastasia was the troupe's operating head, or "Lord High Executioner", assisted by Lepke's longtime associate Jacob "Gurrah" Shapiro. In 1932 Abe Wagner informed on the crime syndicate to the police. He fled to Saint Paul, Minnesota, and adopted a disguise to evade possible pursuit. Two killers, George Young and Joseph Schafer, found and shot him but were later apprehended. Bugsy Siegel failed to get them released. In the 1930s Buchalter used Murder, Inc. to murder witnesses and suspected informants when he was investigated by crusading prosecutor Thomas Dewey. In one case on May 11, 1937, four killers hacked loan shark George Rudnick to pieces on the mere suspicion he was an informant. On  October 1, 1937, they shot and seriously wounded Buchalter's ex-associate Max Rubin. Rubin had disobeyed Buchalter's orders to leave town and "disappear" in order to avoid being summoned as a witness against Buchalter. Three alleged victims of Murder, Inc. in 1935 were Morris Kessler and brothers Louis and Joseph Amberg. Probably their most well known victim was Dutch Schultz, who had openly defied the syndicate. In October 1935, Schultz insisted on putting a hit on Dewey, who was leading an all-out effort to put the mob out of business. The syndicate board overruled Schultz. They feared that Dewey's murder would incite public outrage and result in an even greater campaign to shut down the rackets. Schultz vowed that he would ignore the board's decision and kill Dewey himself. The board decided they needed to act immediately to kill Schultz before he killed Dewey. Therefore, in an ironic twist Buchalter actually saved Dewey's life, which allowed Dewey to continue his efforts to bring down Buchalter. This led Shapiro to suggest years later that Schultz should have been allowed to kill Dewey, although at the time he supported the syndicate's decision to overrule Schultz. Hitmen Mendy Weiss and Charles Workman were given the assignment to kill Schultz. On October 24, 1935, they tracked down Schultz and his associates Otto Berman, Abe Landau, and Lulu Rosenkrantz and shot them at the Palace Chop House in Newark, New Jersey. Berman, Landau, and Rosenkrantz died almost immediately, while Schultz clung to life until the following day. As the thorough Workman stayed behind to make sure they had completed their assignment and finished off Schultz in the men's room of the restaurant, Weiss escaped the scene with their Murder, Inc. getaway driver Seymour Schechter. Furious at being abandoned by his confederates, Workman had to make his way back to Brooklyn by foot. A day or two later Workman filed a 'grievance' with the board against Weiss and Schechter. Although he had simply followed Weiss' frantic orders to drive away without waiting for Workman, the unfortunate Schechter ended up bearing the punishment, becoming a Murder, Inc. victim himself a short time later. In 1944 Weiss ended up in the electric chair for another murder. Workman was eventually tried by the State of New Jersey for the Schultz murder and served 23 years in prison.Brooklyn Gang Solved by Confessions of Pair, O'Dwyer Says 15 SEIZED IN ROUND-UP Penn Case Mistake Laid to Thugs Who Specialized in 'Rubbing Out' Witnesses], The New York Times, March 18, 1940, p.1 Detective Osnato talked with Maffetore, even though he had worked with Rudolph previously and did not put much credibility in his story since Rudolph was paid for information in other cases that turned out to be false.What Makes a Successful Detective; John Osnato, who cracked big cases, used his own formula: stool pigeons and common sense,The New York Times, September 10, 1944, Sunday Magazine, p.SM18 Eventually, Maffetore decided to cooperate, stating that he was not involved in the Alpert murder, but was the driver in six gangland murders.

Reles also testified that he waited outside the garage while Maione, Abbandando and Strauss were inside with Rudnick. After Rudnick was believed to have been murdered, Abbandando called for Reles and summoned Angelo "Julie" Catalano to the garage to assist with moving the body.

Cassele then forced Joseph "Joe the Baker" Liberto, who was being held as a material witness in the George Rudnick murder, to meet with Gurino. According to Liberto, he was pushed up against a wall in his cell and threatened with death if he cooperated with the District Attorney. Liberto was taken into custody shortly after an acquaintance drove him to a farmhouse on Long Island. Liberto quickly exited through a window convinced he was going to be killed.

When Murder Inc. arrives, their van reads: "We rub out anybody $1.00. Midgets—½ price. Japs—FREE." In 1951, Burton B. Turkus, an assistant Brooklyn District Attorney, and Sid Feder, an Associated Press reporter, released one of the most definitive accounts of Murder, Inc. entitled Murder, Inc.: The Story of the Syndicate, published by Plenum and Da Capo Press, and reprinted again in 2012 by  Tenacity Media Books, an imprint of investigative reporter Peter Lance, with a new forward. In 1960, Twentieth Century Fox released the movie Murder, Inc., written for the screen by Irve Tunick and Mel Barr from the book by Burton Turkus and Sid Feder, Murder, Inc. The movie starred Stuart Whitman, Henry Morgan and Peter Falk and was directed by Stuart Rosenberg. In the television series The West Wing, Jules Ziegler (played by Jerry Adler), the father of Toby Ziegler, was stated to be a member of Murder, Inc decades after its dissolution.  The show possibly erroneously dates activities of Murder, Inc. into the 1950s (December 24, 1954).  Although given Toby Ziegler also asked for the date of death of a founder of the organization the story could be playing this as Toby being uninterested in keeping track of the details of a father he is clearly unhappy to see.  The character also could know and chooses to use the more impactful organization to describe his father.  Also, given the fact this show does not exist in the same world as our own (e.g. the story's Presidential elections are in different years from our own), this could be an accurate statement within the world's storyline. An analogy of Murder, Inc., "Homicide International Trust" appears in several episodes of MacGyver, usually through the character Murdoc. The 1951 police procedural, The Enforcer, starring Humphrey Bogart, is loosely based on the prosecution of a Murder, Inc. kingpin. Bruce Springsteen's 1995 Greatest Hits compilation includes a track named "Murder Incorporated".
