    Footscray is a suburb (neighborhood) 5&nbsp;km west of Melbourne, Australia. Its local government area is the City of Maribyrnong. At the 2011 Census, Footscray had a population of 13,203. Footscray is characterised by a very diverse, multicultural central shopping area, which reflects the successive waves of immigration experienced by Melbourne, and by Footscray in particular. Once a centre for Greek, Italian and former Yugoslavian migrants, it later became a hub for Vietnamese and East African immigrants in Melbourne, but has recently begun to undergo gentrification. Footscray is named after Foots Cray, on the River Cray in Kent, England.  Footscray is part of the City of Maribyrnong and was built largely on the traditional lands of the Kulin nation. For thousands of years, Footscray was the meeting place of the lands of the Yalukit-willan, the Marin-balluk and the Wurundjeri. Koories stalked game, collected food and fished along the river junction, estuaries, swamps and lagoons. Within Melbourne's western region, the Marin-balug and Kurung-jand-balug clans of the Woiwurrung cultural group, and the Yalukit willam clan of the Boonwurrung cultural group shared the luscious resources around the Maribyrnong Valley. The first European to visit the area was Charles Grimes in 1803. A park, where he landed, is named after him at Napier St.[ ]  In 1839 a punt was built on the Maribyrnong River, it was the only connecting link between Melbourne and Geelong, Ballarat, Castlemaine and Bendigo. The Punt Hotel opened three years later and was the first building in the area.  During the first decade drovers transporting cattle and sheep provided the only business at the hotel. After 1851, when gold was discovered out west, the pub did a roaring trade with diggers. Part of the old pub still stands and it has been renamed The Pioneer.  (Ref: Charlie Lovett's Footscray) The Post Office first opened on 12 October 1857. Footscray was declared a municipality in 1859 with a population of 300 and 70 buildings. Around the same year the first bridge was built across Saltwater River. (Ref: Charlie Lovett's Footscray) Between 1881 and 1891 Footscray's population more than tripled from almost 6,000 to 19,000. (Ref: Charlie Lovett's Footscray) Footscray developed into an industrial zone in the second half of the nineteenth century, with the manufacturing industry beginning to decline in the 1960s and 70s. Footscray was home to the Aboriginal Woimurrung and Boonwurrung tribes of the Kulin nation.[ ]  In 2011, Footscray's 13,193 residents came from 135 countries. In 2006 less than half the population (41.1%) was born in Australia, the main countries of overseas origin are Vietnam, China, India, United Kingdom and Italy. In the 21st Century, Maribyrnong of which Footscray is a part, saw a major increase in residents from Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, including a large proportion of refugees.[ ]  Footscray has Victoria's fourth-highest proportion of residents born in South-East Asia (13.9%). The average person in Footscray is a youthful 33 years of age. Maribyrnong Council predicts a population boom will more than double Footscray resident numbers from 14,100 to 30,500 by 2031, requiring about 7000 new dwellings.http://www.maribyrnongweekly.com.au/story/1483944/growth-to-test-footscray-cbd-infrastructure-council-report-finds/?cs=1216 Footscray falls within the federal electorate of Gellibrand (currently held by Tim Watts from the ALP) and the state electorate of Footscray (currently held by the ALP's Marsha Thomson), and the City of Maribyrnong at local level (currently controlled by four independents).
