      Gatwick Airport  is  north of the centre of Crawley, West Sussex, and  south of Central London. Also known as London Gatwick, it is London's second-largest international airport and the second-busiest (by total passenger traffic) in the United Kingdom (after Heathrow). Gatwick is Europe's leading airport for point-to-point flightsaccounting for 93&nbsp;percent of all passenger traffic as of March 2012 and has the world's busiest single-use runway, with a maximum of 55 aircraft movements per hour. Its two terminals (North and South) cover an area of  and , respectively. In 2015, 40.3&nbsp;million passengers passed through the airport, a 5.6 per cent increase compared with 2014. From 1978 to 2008, many flights to and from the United States used Gatwick because of restrictions on the use of Heathrow implemented in the Bermuda II agreement between the UK and the US. US Airways, Gatwick's last remaining US carrier, ended service from Gatwick on 30 March 2013. This leaves Gatwick without a scheduled US airline for the first time in over 35 years. The airport is a base for scheduled airlines British Airways (BA), EasyJet, Monarch Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Virgin Atlantic and charter operators such as Thomas Cook Airlines and Thomson Airways. Gatwick is unique amongst London's airports in its representation of the three main airline business models: full service, low-/no frills and charter. As of April 2015, these respectively accounted for 30&nbsp;percent, 64&nbsp;percent and 6&nbsp;percent of Gatwick's seat capacity. BAA Limited (now Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited) and its predecessors, BAA plc and the British Airports Authority, owned and operated Gatwick from 1 April 1966 to 2 December 2009. On 17 September 2008, BAA announced it would sell Gatwick after the Competition Commission published a report about BAA's market dominance in London and the South East. On 21 October 2009 it was announced that an agreement had been reached to sell Gatwick to a consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), who also have a controlling interest in London City and Edinburghas of May 2012 airports, for £1.51&nbsp;billion. The sale was completed on 3 December.  The land on which Gatwick Airport stands was first developed  as an aerodrome in the late 1921 The Air Ministry approved commercial flights from the site in 1933, and the first terminal, "The Beehive" was built in 1935. Major development work at the airport took place during the 1950s. Since 2009, the airport has been owned and operated by Gatwick Airport Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ivy Holdco Limited. Ivy Holdco is owned by a consortium of companies, with the following holdings as of March 2014: In February 2010, GIP sold minority stakes of 12&nbsp;percent and 15&nbsp;percent to the South Korean National Pension Service and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) for £100&nbsp;million and £125&nbsp;million, respectively, in Gatwick's (rather than GIP's) name. The sales were part of GIP's strategy to syndicate the equity portion of the original acquisition by issuing bonds to refinance bank debt. Although this entails bringing additional investors into the airport, GIP aims to retain management control. The Californian state pension fund CalPERS acquired a 12.7-&nbsp;percent stake in Gatwick Airport for about $155&nbsp;million (£104.8&nbsp;million) in June 2010. On 21 December 2010, the A$69&nbsp;billion (£44&nbsp;billion) Future Fund, a sovereign wealth fund established by the Australian government in 2006, agreed to purchase a 17.2-percent stake in Gatwick Airport from GIP for £145&nbsp;million. This transaction completed GIP's syndication process for the airport, reducing its stake to 42&nbsp;percent (although the firm's extra voting rights mean it still controls the airport's board). The airport has two terminals, North and South. Both have shops and restaurants landside and airside, and all areas are accessible to disabled passengers. There are facilities for baby changing and feeding, and play areas and video games for children; business travellers have specialised lounges. On 31 May 2008, Virgin Holidays opened the V Room, Gatwick's first lounge dedicated to leisure travellers, for use by Virgin Holidays customers flying to Orlando, Las Vegas and the Caribbean on sister airline Virgin Atlantic. On 9 April 2009, an independent pay-for-access lounge, No.1 Traveller, opened in the South Terminal. Gatwick has a conference and business centre, and several on- and off-site hotels ranging in class from executive to economy. The airport has Anglican, Catholic and Free Church chaplains, and there are multi-faith prayer and counselling rooms in each terminal. A daily service is led by one of the chaplains."Chaplain's Corner — with Gatwick chaplain Sister Jo Threlfall", Skyport, Gatwick edition, Hammersmith, 29 April 2011, p. 9  The Civil Aviation Authority Safety Regulation Group is in Aviation House."Bus Services to CAA Safety Regulation Group, Aviation House".

Passengers passing through the airport are informed about the redevelopment programme with large mobile barcodes on top of construction hoardings. Scanning these transfers information on the construction to the user's smartphone. In summer 2013, Gatwick introduced Gatwick Connect, a free flight connection service to assist passengers changing flights at Gatwick whose airlines do not provide a full flight connection service. At a Gatwick Connect desk in the baggage reclaim hall in each terminal, passengers can confirm their details or leave their bags for onward flights if already checked in online. As of mid-September 2015, the service is branded "GatwickConnects". It is available to passengers arriving on any airline who have an onward flight connection on Aer Lingus, EasyJet, Flybe, Monarch Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Thomas Cook Airlines, Virgin Atlantic or WOW air. On 15 September 2015, the airport launched a service enabling passengers to book connecting flights involving a change of aircraft at Gatwick, where airlines do not provide a full flight connection service, in a single transaction at a lower cost (compared with the total cost when each flight is booked separately). It includes a guarantee to safeguard connections and make alternative arrangements for passengers who miss their connection in the event of their flight being delayed or cancelled. Gatwick claim this to be a world-first. This service is marketed under the "GatwickConnects" brand and is bookable through Dohop and Skyscanner. Initially, it is available to passengers flying with EasyJet, Norwegian Air Shuttle and WOW air.  Gatwick operates as a single-runway airport although it has two runways; the northern runway (08L/26R) can only be used when the main runway (08R/26L) is out of use for any reason. Documentation published by the airport in April 2014 indicates that the usable length of its main runway (08R/26L) is  when aircraft take off in a westerly direction (26) and  when takeoffs occur in an easterly direction (08). The documentation lists the respective usable runway lengths for the northern runway (08L/26R) as  (direction 08) and  (direction 26), and states that nearly three-quarters of takeoffs are towards the west (74&nbsp;percent, over a 12-month period). Both runways are  wide; they are  apart,"Gatwick Runway Options Consultation" (Section 2: Our runway options / 2.1 Features common to all options – The length of the runway), Gatwick Airport Limited, April 2014, p. 16 which is insufficient for the simultaneous use of both runways. During normal operations the northern runway is used as a taxiway, consistent with its original construction (although it was gradually widened). The main runway uses a Category III Instrument Landing System (ILS). The northern runway does not have an ILS; when it is in use, arriving aircraft use a combination of distance measuring equipment and assistance from the approach controller (using surveillance radar) or (where equipped, and subject to operator approval) an RNAV (GNSS) approach (also available for the main runway). On both runways, a continuous descent approach is used to minimise the environmental effects of incoming aircraft, particularly at night. Night flights are subject to restrictions; between 11&nbsp;pm and 7&nbsp;am, noisier aircraft (rated QC/8 and QC/16) may not operate. From 11.30&nbsp;pm to 6&nbsp;am (the night quota period) there are three limits: The airport is policed by the Gatwick District of Sussex Police. The district is responsible for the entire airport (including aircraft) and, in certain circumstances, aircraft in flight. The 150 officers attached to this district include armed and unarmed officers, and community support officers for minor offences. The airport district counters man-portable surface-to-air missiles (MANPADS) by patrolling in and around the airport, and a separate sub-unit has vehicle checks around the airport."Guarding Gatwick", Airports – September/October 2007 (Key Publishing), p. 17 Gatwick is one of three UK airports with body scanners, located in the main search areas of both terminals. Access to airside portions of the airport is controlled and maintained by the airport's team of security officers, regulated by the Department for Transport. Brook House, an immigration-removal centre of UK Visas and Immigration, was opened near the airport on 18 March 2009 by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.  By late 2015, EasyJet flew over 100 routes from Gatwick with a fleet of more than 60 aircraft. The airport is the carrier's largest base, and its 16&nbsp;million passengers per year accounted for 45&nbsp;percent of Gatwick's 2013 totalThe Times (Business – EasyJet cleared for takeover at Gatwick Airport), UK Edition, London, 28 March 2014 (ahead of Gatwick's second-largest passenger airline: British Airways (BA), whose 4.5&nbsp;million passengers comprised 14 percent of total passenger traffic in 2011–12).1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012 The airport is a hub for BA; BA and EasyJet are Gatwick's dominant resident airlines. In terms of passengers carried, both airlines were among the five largest airlines operating at Gatwick in 2010 (which also included Thomson Airways, Monarch Airlines and Thomas Cook Airlines at the time) and the top 10 in 2015.Airways (Forward, D.C., London Gatwick Goes Global — GIP Gets the Goat Farm: Fast Facts — London Gatwick), Vol. 18, No. 5, p. 27, Airways International Inc., Sandpoint, July 2011 In terms of total scheduled airline seats at Gatwick in 2014, EasyJet accounted for 18.36&nbsp;million, more than two-and-a-half times as many as second-placed BA (seven&nbsp;million) and nearly five times the number offered by third-placed Norwegian (3.74&nbsp;million). Using data sourced from the OAG Schedules Analyser, the following changes in the respective departure seat capacity shares of Gatwick's three biggest airlines occurred from 2010 to 2015: EasyJet's share increased from 26.1&nbsp;percent in 2010 to 42.1&nbsp;percent in 2015; BA's share dropped from 18.3&nbsp;percent in 2010 to 15&nbsp;percent in 2015; Norwegian's share rose almost three-fold from less than 3&nbsp;percent in 2010 to 8.3&nbsp;percent in 2015. The OAG Schedules Analyser data for 2015 also confirms EasyJet, BA, Norwegian, Thomson Airways, Monarch Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, Thomas Cook Airlines, Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Emirates as Gatwick's top 10 airlines in terms of departure seat capacity share. EasyJet's acquisition of BA franchise carrier GB Airways in March 2008 increased its share of airport slots to 24&nbsp;percent (from 17&nbsp;percent in late 2007); the airline became the largest short-haul operator at the airport, accounting for 29&nbsp;percent of short-haul passengers."EasyJet in £103m GB Airways move", Financial Times (London), UK Edition, 26 October 2007 By 2009, BA's share of Gatwick slots had fallen to 20&nbsp;percent from its peak of 40&nbsp;percent in 2001. By 2010, this had declined to 16&nbsp;percent. By mid-2012, EasyJet had 45 percent of Gatwick's early-morning peak time slots (6 am to 8:55&nbsp;am).British Airways, 15%; Thomson Airways, 11%; Monarch Airlines, 7%; Flybe and Thomas Cook Airlines, 6% each  By 2008, Flybe was Gatwick's third-largest airline (accounting for nine&nbsp;percent of its slots) and its fastest-growing airline. It became the airport's largest domestic operator, carrying 1.2&nbsp;million passengers in its 2011–12 financial year on eight routes to destinations in the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. In March 2013, the airline announced that it would end operations at Gatwick, citing unsustainably high airport charges and increases in UK Air Passenger Duty. Flybe sold its 25 pairs of daily slotsincluding eight early-morning peak-time slot pairs at the airport to EasyJet for £20&nbsp;million. The latter's share of Gatwick slots increased to 44&nbsp;percent in summer 2014; second-placed BA has held about 16&nbsp;percent of the airport's slots since 2010. Following the sale of its Gatwick slots to EasyJet, Flybe continues to provide the scheduled service between Gatwick and Newquay, as a result of being awarded the contract to fly this route under a four-year Public Service Obligation (PSO). The EU–US Open Skies Agreement, which became effective on 30 March 2008, led a number of airlines to downsize their transatlantic operations at Gatwick in favour of Heathrow. Continental Airlines was the second transatlantic carrier (after American Airlines) to leave Gatwick after its decision to transfer the seasonal Cleveland service to Heathrow on 3 May 2009.Aviation Week & Space Technology, Vol. 169 No. 10, 15 September 2008, "Goodbye Gatwick", p. 16 Slots left by the US carriers (and the collapse of Zoom, XL Airways UK and Sterling) were taken by EasyJet, Flybe, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair. A number of full-service airlines have established or resumed operations at the airport, including Cathay Pacific, Garuda Indonesia, Swiss International Air Lines and Turkish Airlines. This is part of the airport's strategy to attract higher-spending business travellers (countering its dependence on European low-cost and charter markets), increasing year-round capacity utilisation by smoothing peaks and troughs in traffic. Gatwick's success in persuading these airlines to launch (or re-launch) routes to overseas destinations important for business and leisure travel was aided by a lack of comparable slots at Heathrow. On 16 June 2015, it was announced that Canadian low-cost carrier WestJet will begin flights to Gatwick in the spring of 2016. This was followed by an announcement on 25 June 2015 by Air Canada Rouge that it would begin a seasonal service from Gatwick to Toronto on 20 May 2016.

As part of a recently agreed, seven-year strategic commercial partnership between Gatwick and EasyJet, the airport proposes a number of changes to individual airlines' terminal locations. If agreed by all parties, the proposed changes will see EasyJet consolidate all Gatwick operations in the North Terminal while British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will swap their current terminals. Gatwick believes that these terminal moves will improve the airport's operational efficiency and resilience as the use of different terminals by EasyJet and British Airways would reduce pressure on the North Terminal's check-in, security, boarding and ramp areas at peak times. In addition, a terminal swap by Virgin would free up lounge and gate space for BA long-haul passengers in the South Terminal and, unlike BA's current short-haul schedules, Virgin's long-haul schedules would not clash with EasyJet's busy schedule in the North Terminal due to the airlines' differing peak times. It was confirmed in January 2015 that British Airways will move all its flights to the South Terminal in November 2016 while all EasyJet flights will be consolidated in the North Terminal at the same time. The busiest routes to and from London Gatwick during 2014 are listed in the following table. Gatwick handled 186,172 passengers during its first seven months of operation after the 1956–58 reconstruction; the annual number of passengers passing through the airport was 368,000 in 1959 and 470,000 in 1960."Gatwick Airport History", Business & Community Reference Guide for in and around Crawley 2008/09, Wealden Marketing, 2008, p. 85Golden Gatwick—50 Years of Aviation, Chapter 9 Passenger numbers reached one&nbsp;million for the first time during the 1962-63 fiscal year,1 April 1962 to 31 March 1963 with British United Airways (BUA) accounting for four-fifths.Gatwick Airport: The first 50 years, Woodley, C., The History Press, Stroud, 2014, pp. 86, 158 The 1.5&nbsp;million mark was exceeded for the first time during the 1966–67 fiscal year.1 April 1966 to 31 March 1967 This was also the first time more than half a million scheduled passengers used the airport.Gatwick Airport: The first 50 years, Woodley, C., The History Press, Stroud, 2014, pp. 158/9 Gatwick accommodated two&nbsp;million passengers for the first time during the 1967–68 fiscal year1 April 1967 to 31 March 1968 and three&nbsp;million in the 1969–70 fiscal year,1 April 1969 to 31 March 1970 with BUA accounting for nearly half.Golden Gatwick—50 Years of Aviation, Chapter 9 & 10 By the early 1970s, 5&nbsp;million passengers used Gatwick each year, with a record 5.7&nbsp;million during the 1973–74 fiscal year.1 April 1973 to 31 March 1974 During that period, British Caledonian accounted for approximately half of all charter passengers and three-fourths of scheduled passengers.Golden Gatwick—50 Years of Aviation, Chapter 10 Within a decade annual passenger numbers doubled, to 10&nbsp;million; they doubled again, to over 20&nbsp;million, by the late 1980s.The Gatwick Express, p. 42Iyengar, K., Bermuda Bloomers, Golden Gatwick, Skyport, Gatwick edition, Hounslow, 8 February 2008, p. 18Iyengar, K., The only way is up, Golden Gatwick, Skyport, Gatwick edition, Hounslow, 11 April 2008, p. 14 By the turn of the millennium, Gatwick handled more than 30&nbsp;million passengers annually. By 2015, Gatwick became the first single runway airport to handle more than 40&nbsp;million passengers annually. 40.3&nbsp;million passengers passed through Gatwick in 2015, an increase of 5.6&nbsp;percent over the previous year. North Atlantic, Irish, European scheduled and other long-haulexcluding North Atlantic passenger traffic recorded increases over the previous year of 11.6&nbsp;percent, 8&nbsp;percent, 7.2&nbsp;percent and 4&nbsp;percent to 1.89&nbsp;million, 1.39&nbsp;million, 26.7&nbsp;million and 3.54&nbsp;million, respectively.

Air transport movements increased by 3&nbsp;percent to 267,767. Cargo volume decreased by 17.3&nbsp;percent to 73,411 metric tonnes. Compared with a year earlier, December 2015 passenger numbers increased by 4.7&nbsp;percent to 2.703&nbsp;million (an increase of 120,578 over December 2014). The following changes were recorded amongst individual passenger traffic categories: Irish traffic +15.2&nbsp;percent (118,000 passengers); North Atlantic traffic +14.7&nbsp;percent (119,100 passengers); European scheduled traffic +5.9&nbsp;percent (1.658&nbsp;million passengers); other long-haulexcluding North Atlantic traffic +5.2&nbsp;percent (327,400 passengers); UK traffic +1.3&nbsp;percent (272,800 passengers); European charter traffic -9.8 &nbsp;percent (208,000 passengers). Air transport movements increased by 5.4&nbsp;percent to 19,440. Cargo volume decreased by 11.4&nbsp;percent to 6,508 metric tonnes. Key to continuing growth in long-haul passenger traffic (+7.6&nbsp;percent) was the increase in North Atlantic, Caribbean and Asian traffic, which was driven by additional passengers travelling to and from Las Vegas (+53&nbsp;percent), Los Angeles (+49.9&nbsp;percent), Goa (+25.6&nbsp;percent), Toronto (+22.8&nbsp;percent), Dubai (+12.1&nbsp;percent), Barbados (+11.3&nbsp;percent) and Jamaica (+7.7&nbsp;percent). Average monthly load factors stood at 78.5 percent.  Gatwick has set goals of 40-&nbsp;percent public-transport use by the time annual passenger traffic reaches 40&nbsp;million (estimated in 2015) and 45&nbsp;percent by the time it reaches 45&nbsp;million. The airport is accessible from a motorway spur road at junction 9A of the M23, which links to the main M23 motorway  east at junction 9. The M23 connects with London's orbital motorway, the M25,  north; this provides access to much of Greater London, the South East and beyond, and the M23 is the main route for traffic to the airport. Gatwick is also accessible from the A23, which serves Horley and Redhill to the north and Crawley and Brighton to the south. The A217 provides access northwards to the town of Reigate. The airport has long and short-stay car parks at the airport and off-site, although these are often full in summer. Local restrictions limit parking at (and near) Gatwick.   The airport railway station, next to South Terminal, provides connections along the Brighton Main Line to Victoria Station and London Bridge and Brighton, Worthing, Eastbourne, Portsmouth and Bognor Regis to the south. Although the Gatwick Express to Victoria (operated by Southern) is the best-known service from the station, other companies (including Thameslink and First Great Western) also use the station and Southern services Victoria and London Bridge under its own name. Thameslink provide direct trains to Luton Airport; First Great Western trains directly link Gatwick Airport with Guildford and Reading for onwards connections to Oxford, Bristol, Plymouth and South Wales. Pedestrians may reach Heathrow by a X26 Express Bus outside East Croydon station, an intermediate stop for rail service to London. London Oyster Cards and contactless cards have been accepted on the Line since January 2016.http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/update/2015-11-13/oyster-cards-to-be-used-at-gatwick-and-surrey-stations/ National Express Coaches operates coaches to Heathrow Airport, Stansted Airport and cities and towns throughout the region and country. Oxford Bus Company operate direct services to Oxford, and EasyBus operates mini-coaches from both terminals to Earls Court and West Brompton. Local buses connect North and South Terminals with Crawley, Horley, Redhill, Horsham and Caterham. Services are offered by Metrobus and Fastway, a guided bus rapid transit system which was the first of its kind to be built outside a major city. There are two sets of stairs for pedestrians to leave South Terminal at ground level (near the cycle route) from Zone L and the train-station area (labelled Exit Q and Exit P on the ground), which access local bus stops. Route 21 of the National Cycle Network passes under South Terminal, allowing virtually traffic-free cycling northwards to Horley and southwards to Three Bridges and Crawley. A goods-style lift runs between the terminal and ground level (labelled "Lift to Cycle Route"), near Zone L.   The airport's North and South Terminals are connected by a , elevated, two-way automated people mover track. The shuttle normally consists of two automatic, three-car, driver-less trains. Although colloquially known as a "monorail", the shuttle runs on a dual, concrete track with rubber tyres and is not (technically) a monorail. The Gatwick transit system opened in 1983 when the circular satellite pier was built (connecting the pier to the main terminal), and was the UK's first automated people-moving system. A second track was built in 1987, linking to the North Terminal. Although the original satellite transit line was replaced with a walkway-and-moving walkway link, the inter-terminal shuttle remains in operation. Gatwick began upgrading its shuttle service in April 2008. The original Adtranz C-100 people-mover cars remained in operation until 2009, when they had travelled a total of 2.5&nbsp;million miles (4&nbsp;million km). In September 2009 the vehicles were withdrawn from service to allow the transit system to be upgraded, and the terminals were connected by bus. A new operating system and shuttle cars (six Bombardier CX-100 vehicles) was installed, and the guideway and transit stations were refurbished at a total cost of £45&nbsp;million. The system opened on 1 July 2010, two months ahead of schedule; it featured live journey information and sensory technology to count the number of passengers at stations.  Gatwick has been included in a number of reviews of airport capacity in southeastern England. Expansion options have included a third terminal and a second runway, although a 40-year agreement not to build a second runway was made in 1979 with West Sussex County Council. Expanded operations would allow Gatwick to handle more passengers than Heathrow does today, with a new terminal between two wide-spaced runways. This would complement or replace the South Terminal, depending on expected future traffic. Airport management's proposal for a second runway (south of the existing runway and the airport boundary) were unveiled in July 2013. This was shortlisted for further consideration by the Airports Commission in December 2013, and the commission's final report is due to be published by summer 2015. Another proposal would extend the North Terminal south, with a passenger bridge in the area currently occupied by aircraft stands without jet bridges. Gatwick's draft master plan (released for consultation on 13 October 2011) apparently dropped the passenger-bridge plan in favour of a mid-field satellite (next to the control tower) linking to the North Terminal as part of an expanded 2030 single-runway, two-terminal airport.Draft Gatwick Master Plan (A single runway airport – 2030: 10.2.14 Aprons and piers and Figure A.12, p. 93 and Appendix A – Drawings), Gatwick Airport, West Sussex, 13 October 2011 In late 2011, the Department for Transport also began a feasibility study of a high-speed rail link between Gatwick and Heathrow as part of a plan combining the airports into a "collective" or "virtual hub", Heathwick. The scheme envisages a high-speed rail route parallel to the M25, covering  in 15 minutes. Trains would reach speeds of , and passengers would need to pass through immigration (or check in) only once. On 1 July 2015, the Airports Commission submitted their final report, recommending the expansion of Heathrow Airport as opposed to Gatwick. Whilst the commission recognised Gatwick's benefits and relatively lesser environmental consequences than Heathrow, they felt the economic benefits of Gatwick vs. Heathrow were not as great, nor as broad-ranging. Gatwick are currently disputing the findings.

However, the airline does not have the rights to transport passengers solely between Gatwick and Malmö. 15 September 1936 – A British Airways Ltd de Havilland DH 86 on a night mail flight to Germany crashed on takeoff, killing the airline's chief pilot and two crew members. November 1936 – A British Airways Ltd Fokker F 12 crashed in a wood  south of Gatwick on its final approach to the airport under a low ceiling in poor visibility, killing both pilots and seriously injuring the flight engineer. 17 February 1959 – A Turkish Airlines Vickers Viscount 794D (registration: TC-SEV) on an international charter flight crashed in heavy fog at Newdigate, Surrey, on its approach to Gatwick after striking trees. Fourteen of the 24 on board died, and Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes was amongst the survivors. 5 January 1969 – A Boeing 727-113C (registration: YA-FAR) operating flight 701 of Ariana Afghan Airlines arriving from Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport, Germany, crashed into a house in Fernhill (near Horley, Surrey) in low visibility. The flaps were not extended to maintain flight at final-approach speed. Forty-eight of the 62 on board died, in addition to two on the ground. 28 January 1972 – A British Caledonian Vickers VC10-1109 (registration: G-ARTA) with no passengers aboard sustained severe structural damage as a result of a hard landing at Gatwick at the end of a short ferry flight from Heathrow, where the aircraft had been diverted due to fog at Gatwick. After touching down on runway 08 and applying spoilers and reverse thrust, the aircraft became airborne again, bounced twice and landed heavily. This resulted in a burst front wheel tyre, a separated wheel and a crumpled fuselage (immediately in front of and behind the wings).Classic Airliner (VC10 – The story of a classic jet airliner: Disposal of British Caledonian VC10s), p. 60, Key Publishing, Stamford, 2015 A survey of the aircraft's damage revealed that its airframe was bent out of shape, requiring extensive repairs to be restored to airworthiness. Since the repairs were not cost-effective, the airline's management decided to cannibalise the aircraft for spare parts before scrapping it at Gatwick in 1975. 20 July 1975 – A British Island Airways (BIA) Handley Page Dart Herald 201 (registration: G-APWF) was involved in a runway accident while departing on a scheduled flight to Guernsey. The aircraft lifted off from runway 26 after a ground run of , and appeared airborne for  (with its landing gear retracting), before the rear underside of the fuselage settled back onto the runway and brought the aircraft to a stop. An investigation concluded that the landing gear was retracted before the aircraft had become established in a climb and the flap setting and takeoff speed were incorrect. Although the aircraft incurred substantial damage, none of the 45 occupants were hurt.
