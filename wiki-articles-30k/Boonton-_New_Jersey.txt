    Boonton is a town in Morris County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the town's population was 8,347, reflecting a decline of 149 (−1.8%) from the 8,496 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 153 (+1.8%) from the 8,343 counted in the 1990 Census.Table 7.

The area within the limits of the new Town was formerly part of the old Townships of Pequannock and Hanover." The development of Boonton began in about 1829, as a result of the construction of the Morris Canal and the formation of the New Jersey Iron Company. The original location of the town is now largely under the Jersey City Reservoir, completed in 1904. In 1908, the waters from this reservoir were the first municipal water supply in the United States to be chlorinated."A Public Health Giant Step: Chlorination of U.S. Drinking Water", Water Quality and Health Council.

Proceedings American Water Works Association. 110-34. During the 18th century, the settlement of Boonetown (variously spelled as Booneton or the current Boonton) was established on the Rockaway River, about  downstream from the current site of the town. As early as 1747, Obadiah Baldwin ran an iron refining forge there using the iron ore and charcoal available in the area together with water power from the river. As the ironworks grew, workers and their families formed a community that was named "Boone-Towne" in honor of the Colonial Governor, Thomas Boone, in the year 1761.Town History, Boonton Town. Accessed September 12, 2015. The present town bears only small resemblance to the settlement of Booneton Falls, and still less to Old Boonton, whose site has been covered by the Jersey City reservoir since 1903.Falkenstein, Michelle; and Strauss, Robert. "Jersey Footlights", The New York Times, February 9, 2003. Accessed August 27, 2013. "After 1830, when the canal was completed, most residents moved, and Boonetown faded into history. Only some farms, an orphanage and the Morris County poorhouse were left. In the late 1890's, construction began on the reservoir, which was flooded and completed in 1903."  The Boonton Iron Works were founded about 1770 by Samuel Ogden who, with others in his family, purchased a  tract along the Rockaway River. Throughout the American Revolutionary War the Booneton Iron Works was busily engaged in supplying numerous miscellaneous iron products for the military. After the war, operations at Boonton were continued under John Jacob Faesch and his two sons, and, later, by William Scott, who vainly sought to instill new life in the declining business. In 1824, Scott's interest in rejuvenating the antiquated ironworks faded when he learned that the Morris Canal was soon to be constructed, and that it would be of little service to the community of Booneton a mile or more away. The proximity of the canal to Booneton Falls made that site ideal for a large factory. In 1830, a group of businessmen in New York City incorporated as the New Jersey Iron Company, with a capitalization of $283,000. Machinery and ironworkers were imported from England, and with the erection of the mills, a new community, called Booneton Falls, began to appear on the rugged hillside overlooking the river. The community Main Street is unique in that it is pitched against a cliff overlooking the 'Hollow' of the Rockaway River. This was said to follow an old Native American trail, which followed the original deer path. The new Iron Company flourished for nearly 50 years. The new settlement of Booneton Falls – like the older Booneton downstream – was essentially a one-industry town. After the Company closed down its operations in 1876, the town was on the verge of collapse. Although several attempts – one by Joseph Wharton – were made to re-establish iron works on a smaller scale, none endured for any great length of time. Only vestiges of foundations and structures remain in the "Hollow", between Plane Street and the river, to remind Boonton of its own Iron Age. One of the first of the new industries secured for the town was a silk factory, which, as Pelgram & Meyer, and, later as Van Raalte, Inc., contributed materially to the town's prosperity. Others that followed were a knife factory, a paper mill (at the old settlement, by then called Old Boonton), a nail factory, a brass and iron foundry, and a carriage factory. The Morris Canal, although going into a rapid decline, still employed a number of men; the Lackawanna Railroad, which had completed its Boonton-Paterson branch in 1875, gave employment to a number of Boonton people and provided commuter service to a number of Boonton residents who worked in New York City. There were, of course, many individually owned businesses, such as blacksmith shops, machine shops, bakeries and a miscellany of stores, all of which began to prosper as the nation emerged from the depression of the 1870s. In 1891, the Loanda Hard Rubber Company was founded by Edwin A. Scribner, and began the manufacture of molded hard rubber products. After Scribner died, the management of the firm fell to his son-in-law Richard W. Seabury.  In 1906, Seabury learned of experiments with synthetic resins made by Dr. Leo Baekeland, for whom Bakelite was later to be named. Originally intended by Dr. Baekeland for a synthetic varnish, the new material was used by Seabury in making the world's first molding of organic plastics in 1907. Boontonware, a molded plastic dinnerware, was sold nationwide. George Scribner, son of Loanda founder Edwin Scribner, opted to continue the business of plastics molding and established Boonton Molding. The company went on to produce the Boontonware dinnerware, molded plastic plates, bowls, and cups manufactured in the 1950s and 1960s. The company also operated a factory outlet store in Boonton for many years.  George Scribner was eventually inducted into the Plastics Hall of Fame as a pioneer in developing molding techniques and applications at Boonton Molding Co. from 1920, and preeminent contributor to the development of the industry through his services as president and board chairman of the SPI during the period 1943–1947. The presence of the molded plastics industry helped bring the radio and electronics industries to the Boonton area. In the 1920s, the burgeoning radio industry created a large demand for molded parts, and, thereby, attracted the attention of Richard W. Seabury, who organized Radio Frequency Laboratories to exploit that new field. Spawned by that original company, more than a half dozen radio and electronics firms were later formed, and recognized internationally for the excellence of their products.  A well-known example among radio engineers was the Boonton Radio Co., located in nearby Rockaway, which manufactured a high-quality test instrument known as a Q meter, still used by hobbyists today.  Most of those companies are now divisions of larger corporations and have relocated elsewhere, having undergone name changes in many cases.  The Boonton Radio Co., for instance, was purchased by Hewlett-Packard.  RFL Industries, Aircraft Radio Corporation, Measurements Corporation and Ballantine Laboratories are among those that contributed materially to the prosperity of the area. The largest industry in the town of Boonton during the 20th century began in 1917, when E.A. Stevenson & Company established the "Butter Works" on the site of the old Knox Hat factory, and started processing coconut and other vegetable oils and making margarine. Under later operation by E.F. Drew & Company, the Boonton plant grew to be one of the largest edible oils processors in the country. The plant closed in the early 1990s, and the site is now a Walmart. In recent years, Boonton has attracted several art galleries. Most of the galleries are located on the 800 block of Main Street, with a total of six galleries in the area surrounding Boonton Avenue and Main Street that is often referred to as the Boonton Art District. The galleries hold an art walk showcasing the galleries opening receptions on the first Friday of each month.Stewart, Holly.

The building in which it resides was willed to the Town of Boonton by James Holmes for use as a public library. Holmes was born March 7, 1815, in Massachusetts and moved to Boonton in 1850 to take charge of the Taylor & Lord Nail Factory.  Since he had spent much of his early life moving from place to place and from job to job when he was able to lay down roots in Boonton he developed a strong loyalty to the town and committed himself to its development.  He became very involved in local politics and used his fortune to help develop municipal organizations and community projects.   Holmes held several political posts in his life such as serving as Mayor of Boonton, on the State Board of Education, and on the Boonton Board of Education.  Holmes also used his wealth to improve the town, one example was when he donated the land and purchased the equipment to begin the firehouse in South Boonton.  He served as a volunteer fire fighter in Boonton from the time he arrived until his death.  Holmes also started the first Boonton National Bank and served as its president.  Mr. Holmes died on February 26, 1893. The building itself dates much further back to when Eliza A. Scott purchased the corner lot in 1849 from the New Jersey Iron Company.  Miss Scott built the first structure on the site in that same year. In 1850, the Iron Company engaged James Holmes to serve as superintendent of the nail factory which had just been constructed. James Holmes bought the property and 2 lots for $5,000 in 1856. He resided at his mansion house until his death in February 1893.  Mr. Holmes bequeathed his house and lot to the Boonton Library Association which had incorporated in 1890. On July 1, 1893, the Association disbanded and reorganized itself as the Holmes Library which had been established in May under the terms of Mr. Holmes' will. The gift included the mansion house, $5,000 for endowment purposes only, $2,000 for refitting the house as a library, and $1,000 for the purchase of books. The will stipulated that the Library be governed by a Board of Trustees composed of three lifetime members appointed by him, one member from each of the existing churches at the time, and one member from the Board of Education. The Library officially opened in 1894.  Since its opening the library itself has only been on the first floor, and in later years the basement.  The upper two floors have been used, at various times, as business space, a Masonic Hall, and most recently as three apartments.  The basement also has been used commercially and has at one time housed the printing press for the Boonton Times newspaper.  In 1895, Charles Grubb rented rooms in the Holmes Library and installed presses in the basement where on Oct 4, 1895 he published the first issue of The Boonton Times newspaper. In 1911, he moved to the corner of Main and Cornelia Streets.  The Boonton Holmes Library has gained control of the entire building and is currently beginning renovations to the structure so that the upper floors can be used by the public.
