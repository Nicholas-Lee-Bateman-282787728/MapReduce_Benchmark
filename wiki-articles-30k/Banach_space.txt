 In mathematics, more specifically in functional analysis, a Banach space (pronounced ) is a complete normed vector space. Thus, a Banach space is a vector space with a metric that allows the computation of vector length and distance between vectors and is complete in the sense that a Cauchy sequence of vectors always converges to a well defined limit that is within the space. Banach spaces are named after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach, who introduced this concept and studied it systematically in 1920–1922 along with Hans Hahn and Eduard Helly. Banach spaces originally grew out of the study of function spaces by Hilbert, Fréchet, and Riesz earlier in the century. Banach spaces play a central role in functional analysis. In other areas of analysis, the spaces under study are often Banach spaces. A Banach space is a vector space  over the field  of real numbers, or over the field  of complex numbers, which is equipped with a norm and which is complete with respect to that norm, that is to say, for every Cauchy sequence  in , there exists an element  in  such that \lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=x, or equivalently: \lim_{n\to\infty}\left \|x_n - x \right \|_X = 0. The vector space structure allows one to relate the behavior of Cauchy sequences to that of converging series of vectors. A normed space  is a Banach space if and only if each absolutely convergent series in  converges,see Theorem&nbsp;1.3.9, p.&nbsp;20 in .  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \|v_n\|_X < \infty \quad \text{implies that} \quad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} v_n\ \ \text{converges in} \ \ X.</math>  Completeness of a normed space is preserved if the given norm is replaced by an [[Norm (mathematics)#Definition|equivalent]] one.  All norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent. Every finite-dimensional normed space over {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}} is a Banach space.<ref>see Corollary&nbsp;1.4.18, p.&nbsp;32 in {{harvtxt|Megginson|1998}}.</ref>  == General theory == === Linear operators, isomorphisms === {{main|Bounded operator}} If {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are normed spaces over the same [[ground field]] {{math|'''K'''}}, the set of all [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear transformation|{{math|'''K'''}}-linear maps]] {{math|''T'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is denoted by {{math|''B''(''X'', ''Y'')}}. In infinite-dimensional spaces, not all linear maps are continuous. A linear mapping from a normed space {{mvar|X}} to another normed space is continuous if and only if it is [[bounded operator|bounded]] on the closed [[Unit sphere|unit ball]] of {{mvar|X}}. Thus, the vector space {{math|''B''(''X'', ''Y'')}} can be given the [[operator norm]]  :<math>\|T\| = \sup \left \{\|Tx\|_Y \mid x\in X,\ \|x\|_X\le 1 \right \}. For  a Banach space, the space  is a Banach space with respect to this norm. If  is a Banach space, the space  forms a unital Banach algebra; the multiplication operation is given by the composition of linear maps. If  and  are normed spaces, they are isomorphic normed spaces if there exists a linear bijection  such that  and its inverse  are continuous. If one of the two spaces  or  is complete (or reflexive, separable, etc.) then so is the other space. Two normed spaces  and  are isometrically isomorphic if in addition,  is an isometry, i.e.,  for every  in . The Banach-Mazur distance  between two isomorphic but not isometric spaces  and  gives a measure of how much the two spaces  and  differ. Every normed space  can be isometrically embedded in a Banach space. More precisely, there is a Banach space  and an isometric mapping  such that  is dense in . If  is another Banach space such that there is an isometric isomorphism from  onto a dense subset of , then  is isometrically isomorphic to . This Banach space  is the completion of the normed space . The underlying metric space for  is the same as the metric completion of , with the vector space operations extended from  to . The completion of  is often denoted by \widehat X. The cartesian product  of two normed spaces is not canonically equipped with a norm. However, several equivalent norms are commonly used,see , p.&nbsp;182. such as  \|(x, y)\|_1 = \|x\| + \|y\|, \qquad \|(x, y)\|_\infty = \max (\|x\|, \|y\|)  and give rise to isomorphic normed spaces. In this sense, the product  (or the direct sum ) is complete if and only if the two factors are complete. If  is a closed linear subspace of a normed space , there is a natural norm on the quotient space ,  \| x + M\| = \inf\limits_{m \in M} \|x+m\|.  The quotient  is a Banach space when  is complete.see pp.&nbsp;17–19 in . The quotient map from  onto , sending  in  to its class , is linear, onto and has norm , except when , in which case the quotient is the null space. The closed linear subspace  of  is said to be a complemented subspace of  if  is the range of a bounded linear projection  from  onto . In this case, the space  is isomorphic to the direct sum of  and , the kernel of the projection . Suppose that  and  are Banach spaces and that . There exists a canonical factorization of  as  T = T_1 \circ \pi, \ \ \ T : X \ \overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow}\ X / \operatorname{Ker}(T) \ \overset{T_1}{\longrightarrow} \ Y  where the first map  is the quotient map, and the second map  sends every class  in the quotient to the image  in . This is well defined because all elements in the same class have the same image. The mapping  is a linear bijection from  onto the range , whose inverse need not be bounded. Basic examplessee , pp.&nbsp;11-12. of Banach spaces include: the  spaces and their special cases, the sequence spaces  that consist of scalar sequences indexed by ; among them, the space  of absolutely summable sequences and the space  of square summable sequences; the space  of sequences tending to zero and the space  of bounded sequences; the space  of continuous scalar functions on a compact Hausdorff space , equipped with the max norm,  \|f\|_{C(K)} = \max \{ |f(x)| : x \in K \}, \quad f \in C(K).  According to the Banach–Mazur theorem, every Banach space is isometrically isomorphic to a subspace of some .see , Th.&nbsp;9 p.&nbsp;185. For every separable Banach space , there is a closed subspace  of  such that .see Theorem&nbsp;6.1, p.&nbsp;55 in  Any Hilbert space serves as an example of a Banach space. A Hilbert space  on  is complete for a norm of the form \|x\|_H = \sqrt{\langle x, x \rangle}, where  \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : H \times H \to \mathbf{K} is the inner product, linear in its first argument that satisfies the following: \begin{align} \forall x, y \in H: \quad \langle y, x \rangle &= \overline{\langle x, y \rangle}, \\ \forall x \in H: \quad \langle x, x \rangle &\ge 0, \\ \langle x,x \rangle = 0 \Leftrightarrow x &= 0. \end{align} For example, the space  is a Hilbert space. The Hardy spaces, the Sobolev spaces are examples of Banach spaces that are related to  spaces and have additional structure. They are important in different branches of analysis, Harmonic analysis and Partial differential equations among others. A Banach algebra is a Banach space  over  or , together with a structure of algebra over , such that the product map  is continuous. An equivalent norm on  can be found so that  for all .  If  is a normed space and  the underlying field (either the real or the complex numbers), the continuous dual space is the space of continuous linear maps from  into , or continuous linear functionals. The notation for the continuous dual is  in this article.Several books about functional analysis use the notation  for the continuous dual, for example , , , , . Since  is a Banach space (using the absolute value as norm), the dual  is a Banach space, for every normed space . The main tool for proving the existence of continuous linear functionals is the Hahn–Banach theorem. Hahn–Banach theorem. Let  be a vector space over the field . Let further *  be a linear subspace, *  be a sublinear function and *  be a linear functional so that  for all  in . Then, there exists a linear functional  so that :F|_Y=f, \quad \text{and} \quad \forall x\in X, \ \ \operatorname{Re}(F(x))\leq p(x).  In particular, every continuous linear functional on a subspace of a normed space can be continuously extended to the whole space, without increasing the norm of the functional.Theorem&nbsp;1.9.6, p.&nbsp;75 in  An important special case is the following: for every vector  in a normed space , there exists a continuous linear functional  on  such that f(x) = \|x\|_X, \quad \| f \|_{X'} \le 1. When  is not equal to the  vector, the functional  must have norm one, and is called a norming functional for . The Hahn–Banach separation theorem states that two disjoint non-empty convex sets in a real Banach space, one of them open, can be separated by a closed affine hyperplane. The open convex set lies strictly on one side of the hyperplane, the second convex set lies on the other side but may touch the hyperplane.see also Theorem&nbsp;2.2.26, p.&nbsp;179 in  A subset  in a Banach space  is total if the linear span of  is dense in . The subset  is total in  if and only if the only continuous linear functional that vanishes on  is the  functional: this equivalence follows from the Hahn–Banach theorem. If  is the direct sum of two closed linear subspaces  and , then the dual  of  is isomorphic to the direct sum of the duals of  and .see p.&nbsp;19 in . If  is a closed linear subspace in , one can associate the orthogonal of  in the dual, M^\perp = \left \{ x' \in X' : x'(m) = 0, \ \forall m \in M \right \}. The orthogonal  is a closed linear subspace of the dual. The dual of  is isometrically isomorphic to . The dual of  is isometrically isomorphic to .Theorems&nbsp;1.10.16, 1.10.17 pp.94–95 in  The dual of a separable Banach space need not be separable, but: Theorem.Theorem&nbsp;1.12.11, p.&nbsp;112 in  Let  be a normed space. If  is separable, then  is separable. When  is separable, the above criterion for totality can be used for proving the existence of a countable total subset in . The weak topology on a Banach space  is the coarsest topology on  for which all elements  in the continuous dual space  are continuous. The norm topology is therefore finer than the weak topology. It follows from the Hahn–Banach separation theorem that the weak topology is Hausdorff, and that a norm-closed convex subset of a Banach space is also weakly closed.Theorem&nbsp;2.5.16, p.&nbsp;216 in . A norm-continuous linear map between two Banach spaces  and  is also weakly continuous, i.e., continuous from the weak topology of  to that of .see II.A.8, p.&nbsp;29 in  If  is infinite-dimensional, there exist linear maps which are not continuous. The space  of all linear maps from  to the underlying field  (this space  is called the algebraic dual space, to distinguish it from ) also induces a topology on  which is finer than the weak topology, and much less used in functional analysis. On a dual space , there is a topology weaker than the weak topology of , called weak* topology. It is the coarsest topology on  for which all evaluation maps , are continuous. Its importance comes from the Banach–Alaoglu theorem. Banach–Alaoglu Theorem. Let  be a normed vector space. Then the closed unit ball  of the dual space is compact in the weak* topology. The Banach–Alaoglu theorem depends on Tychonoff's theorem about infinite products of compact spaces. When  is separable, the unit ball  of the dual is a metrizable compact in the weak* topology.see Theorem&nbsp;2.6.23, p.&nbsp;231 in . The dual of  is isometrically isomorphic to : for every bounded linear functional  on , there is a unique element  such that  f(x) = \sum_{n \in \mathbf{N}} x_n y_n, \qquad x = \{x_n\} \in c_0, \ \ \text{and} \ \ \|f\|_{(c_0)'} = \|y\|_{\ell_1}.  The dual of  is isometrically isomorphic to . The dual of  is isometrically isomorphic to  when  and . For every vector  in a Hilbert space , the mapping x \in H \to f_y(x) = \langle x, y \rangle defines a continuous linear functional  on . The Riesz representation theorem states that every continuous linear functional on  is of the form  for a uniquely defined vector  in . The mapping  is an antilinear isometric bijection from  onto its dual . When the scalars are real, this map is an isometric isomorphism. When  is a compact Hausdorff topological space, the dual  of  is the space of Radon measures in the sense of Bourbaki.see N. Bourbaki, (2004), "Integration I", Springer Verlag, ISBN 3-540-41129-1. The subset  of  consisting of non-negative measures of mass 1 (probability measures) is a convex w*-closed subset of the unit ball of . The extreme points of  are the Dirac measures on . The set of Dirac measures on , equipped with the w*-topology, is homeomorphic to . Banach-Stone Theorem. If  and  are compact Hausdorff spaces and if  and  are isometrically isomorphic, then the topological spaces  and  are homeomorphic.see also , p.&nbsp;170 for metrizable  and . The result has been extended by Amirsee D. Amir, "On isomorphisms of continuous function spaces". Israel J. Math. 3 (1965), 205–210. and CambernM. Cambern, "A generalized Banach-Stone theorem". Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 17 (1966), 396–400, and "On isomorphisms with small bound". Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 18 (1967), 1062–1066. to the case when the multiplicative Banach–Mazur distance between  and  is . The theorem is no longer true when the distance is .H. B. Cohen, "A bound-two isomorphism between  Banach spaces". Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 50 (1975), 215–217. In the commutative Banach algebra , the maximal ideals are precisely kernels of Dirac mesures on , I_x = \ker \delta_x = \{f \in C(K) : f(x) = 0\}, \quad x \in K. More generally, by the Gelfand-Mazur theorem, the maximal ideals of a unital commutative Banach algebra can be identified with its characters---not merely as sets but as topological spaces: the former with the hull-kernel topology and the latter with the w*-topology. In this identification, the maximal ideal space can be viewed as a w*-compact subset of the unit ball in the dual . Theorem. If  is a compact Hausdorff space, then the maximal ideal space  of the Banach algebra  is homeomorphic to . Not every unital commutative Banach algebra is of the form  for some compact Hausdorff space . However, this statement holds if one places  in the smaller category of commutative C*-algebras. Gelfand's representation theorem for commutative C*-algebras states that every commutative unital C*-algebra  is isometrically isomorphic to a  space.see for example W. Arveson, (1976), "An Invitation to C*-Algebra", Springer-Verlag, ISBN 0-387-90176-0. The Hausdorff compact space  here is again the maximal ideal space, also called the spectrum of  in the C*-algebra context. If  is a normed space, the (continuous) dual  of the dual  is called bidual, or second dual of . For every normed space , there is a natural map,  \begin{cases} F_X : X \to X'' \\ F_X(x) (f) = f(x) & \forall x \in X, \forall f \in X'\end{cases} This defines  as a continuous linear functional on , i.e., an element of . The map  is a linear map from  to . As a consequence of the existence of a norming functional  for every  in , this map  is isometric, thus injective. For example, the dual of  is identified with , and the dual of  is identified with , the space of bounded scalar sequences. Under these identifications,  is the inclusion map from  to . It is indeed isometric, but not onto. If  is surjective, then the normed space  is called reflexive (see below). Being the dual of a normed space, the bidual  is complete, therefore, every reflexive normed space is a Banach space. Using the isometric embedding , it is customary to consider a normed space  as a subset of its bidual. When  is a Banach space, it is viewed as a closed linear subspace of . If  is not reflexive, the unit ball of  is a proper subset of the unit ball of . The Goldstine theorem states that the unit ball of a normed space is weakly*-dense in the unit ball of the bidual. In other words, for every  in the bidual, there exists a net  in  so that \sup_j \|x_j\| \le \|x''\|, \ \ x''(f) = \lim_j f(x_j), \quad f \in X'. The net may be replaced by a weakly*-convergent sequence when the dual  is separable. On the other hand, elements of the bidual of  that are not in  cannot be weak*-limit of sequences in , since  is weakly sequentially complete. Here are the main general results about Banach spaces that go back to the time of Banach's book () and are related to the Baire category theorem. According to this theorem, a complete metric space (such as a Banach space, a Fréchet space or an F-space) cannot be equal to a union of countably many closed subsets with empty interiors. Therefore, a Banach space cannot be the union of countably many closed subspaces, unless it is already equal to one of them; a Banach space with a countable Hamel basis is finite-dimensional. Banach–Steinhaus Theorem. Let  be a Banach space and  be a normed vector space. Suppose that  is a collection of continuous linear operators from  to . The uniform boundedness principle states that if for all  in  we have , then . The Banach–Steinhaus theorem is not limited to Banach spaces. It can be extended for example to the case where  is a Fréchet space, provided the conclusion is modified as follows: under the same hypothesis, there exists a neighborhood  of  in  such that all  in  are uniformly bounded on , \sup_{T \in F} \sup_{x \in U} \; \|T(x)\|_Y  The Open Mapping Theorem. Let  and  be Banach spaces and  be a continuous linear operator. Then  is surjective if and only if  is an open map. Corollary. Every one-to-one bounded linear operator from a Banach space onto a Banach space is an isomorphism. The First Isomorphism Theorem for Banach spaces. Suppose that  and  are Banach spaces and that . Suppose further that the range of  is closed in . Then  is isomorphic to . This result is a direct consequence of the preceding Banach isomorphism theorem and of the canonical factorization of bounded linear maps. Corollary. If a Banach space  is the internal direct sum of closed subspaces , then  is isomorphic to . This is another consequence of Banach's isomorphism theorem, applied to the continuous bijection from  onto  sending  to the sum . The Closed Graph Theorem. Let  be a linear mapping between Banach spaces. The graph of  is closed in  if and only if  is continuous.  The normed space  is called reflexive when the natural map  \begin{cases} F_X : X \to X'' \\ F_X(x) (f) = f(x) & \forall x \in X, \forall f \in X'\end{cases} is surjective. Reflexive normed spaces are Banach spaces. Theorem. If  is a reflexive Banach space, every closed subspace of  and every quotient space of  are reflexive. This is a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem. Further, by the open mapping theorem, if there is a bounded linear operator from the Banach space  onto the Banach space , then  is reflexive. Theorem. If  is a Banach space, then  is reflexive if and only if  is reflexive. Corollary. Let  be a reflexive Banach space. Then  is separable if and only if  is separable. Indeed, if the dual  of a Banach space  is separable, then  is separable. If  is reflexive and separable, then the dual of  is separable, so  is separable. Theorem. Suppose that  are normed spaces and that . Then  is reflexive if and only if each  is reflexive. Hilbert spaces are reflexive. The  spaces are reflexive when . More generally, uniformly convex spaces are reflexive, by the Milman–Pettis theorem. The spaces  are not reflexive. In these examples of non-reflexive spaces , the bidual  is "much larger" than . Namely, under the natural isometric embedding of  into  given by the Hahn–Banach theorem, the quotient  is infinite-dimensional, and even nonseparable. However, Robert C. James has constructed an example of a non-reflexive space, usually called "the James space" and denoted by J,see , p.&nbsp;25. such that the quotient  is one-dimensional. Furthermore, this space  is isometrically isomorphic to its bidual. Theorem. A Banach space  is reflexive if and only if its unit ball is compact in the weak topology. When  is reflexive, it follows that all closed and bounded convex subsets of  are weakly compact. In a Hilbert space , the weak compactness of the unit ball is very often used in the following way: every bounded sequence in  has weakly convergent subsequences. Weak compactness of the unit ball provides a tool for finding solutions in reflexive spaces to certain optimization problems. For example, every convex continuous function on the unit ball  of a reflexive space attains its minimum at some point in . As a special case of the preceding result, when  is a reflexive space over , every continuous linear functional  in  attains its maximum  on the unit ball of . The following theorem of Robert C. James provides a converse statement. James' Theorem. For a Banach space the following two properties are equivalent: *  is reflexive. * for all  in  there exists  in  with , so that  The theorem can be extended to give a characterization of weakly compact convex sets. On every non-reflexive Banach space , there exist continuous linear functionals that are not norm-attaining. However, the Bishop–Phelps theoremsee E. Bishop and R. Phelps, "A proof that every Banach space is subreflexive". Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 67 (1961), 97–98. states that norm-attaining functionals are norm dense in the dual  of . A sequence  in a Banach space  is weakly convergent to a vector  if  converges to  for every continuous linear functional  in the dual . The sequence  is a weakly Cauchy sequence if  converges to a scalar limit , for every  in . A sequence  in the dual  is weakly* convergent to a functional  if  converges to  for every  in . Weakly Cauchy sequences, weakly convergent and weakly* convergent sequences are norm bounded, as a consequence of the Banach–Steinhaus theorem. When the sequence  in  is a weakly Cauchy sequence, the limit  above defines a bounded linear functional on the dual , i.e., an element  of the bidual of , and  is the limit of  in the weak*-topology of the bidual. The Banach space  is weakly sequentially complete if every weakly Cauchy sequence is weakly convergent in . It follows from the preceding discussion that reflexive spaces are weakly sequentially complete. Theorem. see III.C.14, p.&nbsp;140 in . For every measure , the space  is weakly sequentially complete. An orthonormal sequence in a Hilbert space is a simple example of a weakly convergent sequence, with limit equal to the  vector. The unit vector basis of , or of , is another example of a weakly null sequence, i.e., a sequence that converges weakly to . For every weakly null sequence in a Banach space, there exists a sequence of convex combinations of vectors from the given sequence that is norm-converging to .see Corollary&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;11 in . The unit vector basis of  is not weakly Cauchy. Weakly Cauchy sequences in  are weakly convergent, since -spaces are weakly sequentially complete. Actually, weakly convergent sequences in  are norm convergent.see p.&nbsp;85 in . This means that  satisfies Schur's property. Weakly Cauchy sequences and the  basis are the opposite cases of the dichotomy established in the following deep result of&nbsp;H.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Rosenthal.Rosenthal, Haskell P. (1974), "A characterization of Banach spaces containing ℓ1", Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 71:2411–2413. Rosenthal's proof is for real scalars. The complex version of the result is due to L. Dor, in Dor, Leonard E. (1975), "On sequences spanning a complex ℓ1 space", Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 47:515–516. Theorem.see p.&nbsp;201 in . Let  be a bounded sequence in a Banach space. Either  has a weakly Cauchy subsequence, or it admits a subsequence equivalent to the standard unit vector basis of . A complement to this result is due to Odell and Rosenthal&nbsp;(1975). Theorem.. Let  be a separable Banach space. The following are equivalent: *The space  does not contain a closed subspace isomorphic to . *Every element of the bidual  is the weak*-limit of a sequence  in . By the Goldstine theorem, every element of the unit ball  of  is weak*-limit of a net in the unit ball of . When  does not contain , every element of  is weak*-limit of a sequence in the unit ball of .Odell and Rosenthal, Sublemma p.&nbsp;378 and Remark p.&nbsp;379. When the Banach space  is separable, the unit ball of the dual , equipped with the weak*-topology, is a metrizable compact space , and every element  in the bidual  defines a bounded function on :  x' \in K \mapsto x''(x'), \quad \left |x''(x') \right | \le \left \|x'' \right \|. This function is continuous for the compact topology of  if and only if  is actually in , considered as subset of . Assume in addition for the rest of the paragraph that  does not contain . By the preceding result of Odell and Rosenthal, the function  is the pointwise limit on  of a sequence  of continuous functions on , it is therefore a first Baire class function on . The unit ball of the bidual is a pointwise compact subset of the first Baire class on .for more on pointwise compact subsets of the Baire class, see . When  is separable, the unit ball of the dual is weak*-compact by Banach–Alaoglu and metrizable for the weak* topology, hence every bounded sequence in the dual has weakly* convergent subsequences. This applies to separable reflexive spaces, but more is true in this case, as stated below. The weak topology of a Banach space  is metrizable if and only if  is finite-dimensional.see Proposition&nbsp;2.5.14, p.&nbsp;215 in . If the dual  is separable, the weak topology of the unit ball of  is metrizable. This applies in particular to separable reflexive Banach spaces. Although the weak topology of the unit ball is not metrizable in general, one can characterize weak compactness using sequences. Eberlein–Šmulian theorem.see for example p.&nbsp;49, II.C.3 in . A set  in a Banach space is relatively weakly compact if and only if every sequence  in  has a weakly convergent subsequence. A Banach space  is reflexive if and only if each bounded sequence in  has a weakly convergent subsequence.see Corollary&nbsp;2.8.9, p.&nbsp;251 in . A weakly compact subset  in  is norm-compact. Indeed, every sequence in  has weakly convergent subsequences by Eberlein–Šmulian, that are norm convergent by the Schur property of .  A Schauder basis in a Banach space  is a sequence  of vectors in X with the property that for every vector  in , there exist uniquely defined scalars  depending on , such that  x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x_n e_n, \quad \textit{i.e.,} \quad x = \lim_n P_n(x), \ P_n(x) := \sum_{k=0}^n x_k e_k. Banach spaces with a Schauder basis are necessarily separable, because the countable set of finite linear combinations with rational coefficients (say) is dense. It follows from the Banach–Steinhaus theorem that the linear mappings are uniformly bounded by some constant . Let  denote the coordinate functionals which assign to every  in  the coordinate  of  in the above expansion. They are called biorthogonal functionals. When the basis vectors have norm , the coordinate functionals  have norm  in the dual of . Most classical separable spaces have explicit bases. The Haar system  is a basis for . The trigonometric system is a basis in  when . The Schauder system is a basis in the space .see  p.&nbsp;3. The question of whether the disk algebra  has a basisthe question appears p.&nbsp;238, §3 in Banach's book, . remained open for more than forty years, until Bočkarev showed in 1974 that  admits a basis constructed from the Franklin system.see S. V. Bočkarev, "Existence of a basis in the space of functions analytic in the disc, and some properties of Franklin's system". (Russian) Mat. Sb. (N.S.) 95(137) (1974), 3–18, 159. Since every vector  in a Banach space  with a basis is the limit of , with  of finite rank and uniformly bounded, the space  satisfies the bounded approximation property. The first examplesee P. Enflo, "A counterexample to the approximation property in Banach spaces". Acta Math. 130, 309–317(1973). by Enflo of a space failing the approximation property was at the same time the first example of a separable Banach space without a Schauder basis. Robert C. James characterized reflexivity in Banach spaces with a basis: the space  with a Schauder basis is reflexive if and only if the basis is both shrinking and boundedly complete.see R.C. James, "Bases and reflexivity of Banach spaces". Ann. of Math. (2) 52, (1950). 518–527. See also  p.&nbsp;9. In this case, the biorthogonal functionals form a basis of the dual of .   Let  and  be two -vector spaces. The tensor product  of  and  is a -vector space  with a bilinear mapping  which has the following universal property: If  is any bilinear mapping into a -vector space , then there exists a unique linear mapping  such that . The image under  of a couple  in  is denoted by , and called a simple tensor. Every element  in  is a finite sum of such simple tensors. There are various norms that can be placed on the tensor product of the underlying vector spaces, amongst others the projective cross norm and injective cross norm introduced by A. Grothendieck in 1955.see A. Grothendieck, "Produits tensoriels topologiques et espaces nucléaires". Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 1955 (1955), no. 16, 140 pp., and A. Grothendieck, "Résumé de la théorie métrique des produits tensoriels topologiques". Bol. Soc. Mat. São Paulo 8 1953 1–79. In general, the tensor product of complete spaces is not complete again. When working with Banach spaces, it is customary to call projective tensor productsee chap.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;15 in . of two Banach spaces  and  the completion X \widehat{\otimes}_\pi Y of the algebraic tensor product  equipped with the projective tensor norm, and similarly for the injective tensor productsee chap.&nbsp;3, p.&nbsp;45 in .

Grothendieck proved in particular thatsee Example.&nbsp;2.19, p.&nbsp;29, and pp.&nbsp;49–50 in . \begin{align} C(K) \widehat{\otimes}_\varepsilon Y &\simeq C(K, Y), \\ L^1([0, 1]) \widehat{\otimes}_\pi Y &\simeq L^1([0, 1], Y), \end{align} where  is a compact Hausdorff space,  the Banach space of continuous functions from  to  and  the space of Bochner-measurable and integrable functions from  to , and where the isomorphisms are isometric. The two isomorphisms above are the respective extensions of the map sending the tensor  to the vector-valued function . Let  be a Banach space. The tensor product X' \widehat \otimes_\varepsilon X is identified isometrically with the closure in  of the set of finite rank operators. When  has the approximation property, this closure coincides with the space of compact operators on . For every Banach space , there is a natural norm  linear map  Y \widehat\otimes_\pi X \to Y \widehat\otimes_\varepsilon X  obtained by extending the identity map of the algebraic tensor product. Grothendieck related the approximation problem to the question of whether this map is one-to-one when  is the dual of . Precisely, for every Banach space , the map  X' \widehat \otimes_\pi X \ \longrightarrow X' \widehat \otimes_\varepsilon X  is one-to-one if and only if  has the approximation property.see Proposition&nbsp;4.6, p.&nbsp;74 in . Grothendieck conjectured that X \widehat{\otimes}_\pi Y and X \widehat{\otimes}_\varepsilon Y must be different whenever  and  are infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. This was disproved by Gilles Pisier in 1983.see Pisier, Gilles (1983), "Counterexamples to a conjecture of Grothendieck", Acta Math. 151:181–208. Pisier constructed an infinite-dimensional Banach space  such that X \widehat{\otimes}_\pi X and X \widehat{\otimes}_\varepsilon X are equal. Furthermore, just as Enflo's example, this space  is a "hand-made" space that fails to have the approximation property. On the other hand, Szankowski proved that the classical space  does not have the approximation property.see Szankowski, Andrzej (1981), " does not have the approximation property", Acta Math. 147: 89–108. Ryan claims that this result is due to Per Enflo, p.&nbsp;74 in . A necessary and sufficient condition for the norm of a Banach space  to be associated to an inner product is the parallelogram identity: \forall x, y \in X : \qquad \|x+y\|^2 + \|x-y\|^2 = 2 \left (\|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2 \right). It follows, for example, that the Lebesgue space  is a Hilbert space only when . If this identity is satisfied, the associated inner product is given by the polarization identity. In the case of real scalars, this gives: \langle x, y\rangle = \tfrac{1}{4} \left (\|x+y\|^2 - \|x-y\|^2 \right ). For complex scalars, defining the inner product so as to be -linear in , antilinear in , the polarization identity gives: \langle x,y\rangle = \tfrac{1}{4} \left( \|x+y\|^2 - \|x-y\|^2 + i \left (\|x+iy\|^2 - \|x-iy\|^2 \right )\right). To see that the parallelogram law is sufficient, one observes in the real case that  is symmetric, and in the complex case, that it satisfies the Hermitian symmetry property and . The parallelogram law implies that  is additive in . It follows that it is linear over the rationals, thus linear by continuity. Several characterizations of spaces isomorphic (rather than isometric) to Hilbert spaces are available. The parallelogram law can be extended to more than two vectors, and weakened by the introduction of a two-sided inequality with a constant : Kwapień proved that if  c^{-2} \sum_{k=1}^n \left \|x_k \right \|^2 \le \operatorname{Ave}_{\pm} \left \| \sum_{k=1}^n \pm x_k \right \|^2 \le c^2 \sum_{k=1}^n \left \|x_k \right \|^2 for every integer  and all families of vectors , then the Banach space  is isomorphic to a Hilbert space.see Kwapień, S. (1970), "A linear topological characterization of inner-product spaces", Studia Math. 38:277–278. Here,  denotes the average over the  possible choices of signs . In the same article, Kwapień proved that the validity of a Banach-valued Parseval's theorem for the Fourier transform characterizes Banach spaces isomorphic to Hilbert spaces. Lindenstrauss and Tzafriri proved that a Banach space in which every closed linear subspace is complemented (that is, is the range of a bounded linear projection) is isomorphic to a Hilbert space.see Lindenstrauss, J. and Tzafriri, L. (1971), "On the complemented subspaces problem", Israel J. Math. 9:263–269. The proof rests upon Dvoretzky's theorem about Euclidean sections of high-dimensional centrally symmetric convex bodies. In other words, Dvoretzky's theorem states that for every integer , any finite-dimensional normed space, with dimension sufficiently large compared to , contains subspaces nearly isometric to the -dimensional Euclidean space. The next result gives the solution of the so-called homogeneous space problem. An infinite-dimensional Banach space  is said to be homogeneous if it is isomorphic to all its infinite-dimensional closed subspaces. A Banach space isomorphic to  is homogeneous, and Banach asked for the converse.see p.&nbsp;245 in . The homogeneity property is called "propriété&nbsp;(15)" there. Banach writes: "on ne connaît aucun exemple d'espace à une infinité de dimensions qui, sans être isomorphe avec (L2), possède la propriété&nbsp;(15)". Theorem.Gowers, W. T. (1996), "A new dichotomy for Banach spaces", Geom. Funct. Anal. 6:1083–1093. A Banach space isomorphic to all its infinite-dimensional closed subspaces is isomorphic to a separable Hilbert space. An infinite-dimensional Banach space is hereditarily indecomposable when no subspace of it can be isomorphic to the direct sum of two infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. The Gowers dichotomy theorem asserts that every infinite-dimensional Banach space  contains, either a subspace  with unconditional basis, or a hereditarily indecomposable subspace , and in particular,  is not isomorphic to its closed hyperplanes.see Gowers, W. T. (1994), "A solution to Banach's hyperplane problem", Bull. London Math. Soc. 26:523–530. If  is homogeneous, it must therefore have an unconditional basis. It follows then from the partial solution obtained by Komorowski and Tomczak–Jaegermann, for spaces with an unconditional basis,see Komorowski, Ryszard A. and Tomczak–Jaegermann, Nicole (1995), "Banach spaces without local unconditional structure", Israel J. Math. 89:205–226 and also (1998), "Erratum to: Banach spaces without local unconditional structure", Israel J. Math. 105:85–92. that  is isomorphic to . When two compact Hausdorff spaces  and  are homeomorphic, the Banach spaces  and  are isometric. Conversely, when  is not homeomorphic to , the (multiplicative) Banach–Mazur distance between  and  must be greater than or equal to , see above the results by Amir and Cambern. Although uncountable compact metric spaces can have different homeomorphy types, one has the following result due to Milutin:Milyutin, Alekseĭ A. (1966), "Isomorphism of the spaces of continuous functions over compact sets of the cardinality of the continuum". (Russian) Teor. Funkciĭ Funkcional. Anal. i Priložen. Vyp. 2:150–156. Theorem.Milutin. See also Rosenthal, Haskell P., "The Banach spaces C(K)" in Handbook of the geometry of Banach spaces, Vol. 2, 1547–1602, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 2003. Let  be an uncountable compact metric space. Then  is isomorphic to . The situation is different for countably infinite compact Hausdorff spaces. Every countably infinite compact  is homeomorphic to some closed interval of ordinal numbers  \langle 1, \alpha \rangle = \{ \gamma \ :\ 1 \le \gamma \le \alpha\} equipped with the order topology, where  is a countably infinite ordinal.One can take , where  is the Cantor–Bendixson rank of , and  is the finite number of points in the β-th derived set  of . See Mazurkiewicz, Stefan; Sierpiński, Wacław (1920), "Contribution à la topologie des ensembles dénombrables", Fundamenta Mathematicae 1: 17–27. The Banach space  is then isometric to . When  are two countably infinite ordinals, and assuming , the spaces  and  are isomorphic if and only if .Bessaga, Czesław; Pełczyński, Aleksander (1960), "Spaces of continuous functions. IV. On isomorphical classification of spaces of continuous functions", Studia Math. 19:53–62. For example, the Banach spaces C(\langle 1, \omega\rangle), \ C(\langle 1, \omega^{\omega} \rangle), \ C(\langle 1, \omega^{\omega^2}\rangle), \ C(\langle 1, \omega^{\omega^3} \rangle), \cdots, C(\langle 1, \omega^{\omega^\omega} \rangle), \cdots are mutually non-isomorphic. A glossary of symbols: Several concepts of a derivative may be defined on a Banach space. See the articles on the Fréchet derivative and the Gâteaux derivative for details. The Fréchet derivative allows for an extension of the concept of a directional derivative to Banach spaces. The Gâteaux derivative allows for an extension of a directional derivative to locally convex topological vector spaces. Fréchet differentiability is a stronger condition than Gâteaux differentiability. The quasi-derivative is another generalization of directional derivative that implies a stronger condition than Gâteaux differentiability, but a weaker condition than Fréchet differentiability. Several important spaces in functional analysis, for instance the space of all infinitely often differentiable functions R → R, or the space of all distributions on R, are complete but are not normed vector spaces and hence not Banach spaces. In Fréchet spaces one still has a complete metric, while LF-spaces are complete uniform vector spaces arising as limits of Fréchet spaces.   Classical Banach spaces !! Dual space !!

Equipped with the max norm on , the disk algebra  is a closed subalgebra of . The Wiener algebra  is the algebra of functions on the unit circle  with absolutely convergent Fourier series. Via the map associating a function on  to the sequence of its Fourier coefficients, this algebra is isomorphic to the Banach algebra , where the product is the convolution of sequences.
