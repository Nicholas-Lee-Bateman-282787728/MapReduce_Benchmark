   Decatur is a city in Morgan and Limestone counties in the State of Alabama. The city, affectionately known as "The River City", is located in Northern Alabama on the banks of Wheeler Lake, along the Tennessee River. It is the largest city and county seat of Morgan County.  The population in 2010 census was 55,683. Decatur is also the core city of the two-county large Decatur, Alabama Metropolitan Area which had an estimated population of 153,374 in 2013.  Combined with the Huntsville Metropolitan Area, the two create the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area, of which Decatur is the second largest city. Like many southern cities in the early 19th century, Decatur's early success was based upon its location along a river.  Railroad routes and boating traffic pushed the city to the front of North Alabama's  economic atmosphere.  The city rapidly grew into a large economic center within the Tennessee Valley and was a hub for travelers and cargo between Nashville and Mobile, as well as Chattanooga and New Orleans. Throughout the 20th century, the city experienced steady growth, but was eclipsed as the regional economic center by the fast-growing Huntsville during the space race.  The city now finds its economy heavily based on manufacturing, cargo transit, and hi-tech industries such as General Electric, and the United Launch Alliance.  Initially the area was known as "Rhodes Ferry Landing", named for Dr. Henry W. Rhodes, an early landowner who operated a ferry that crossed the Tennessee River in the 1810s at the present-day location of Rhodes Ferry Park. The city was incorporated as Decatur in 1821. It was named in honor of Stephen Decatur; after he was killed in a duel in 1820, President Monroe directed that the Alabama town be named for him. In the early 1830s, Decatur was the eastern terminus of the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad, the first railway built west of the Appalachian Mountains.  In 1850 the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad was incorporated into the Memphis & Charleston Railroad. Because of its location on the Tennessee River at the strategically important crossing of two major railroads, Decatur was the site of several encounters during the American Civil War. When the Union army occupied the city early in the war, the commanding general ordered all but four buildings in the town destroyed. Bricks from some of the churches in town were used to build stoves and chimneys for the buildings that housed soldiers. The four buildings that remained (and are still standing) are the Old State Bank, the Dancy-Polk House, the Todd House, and the Burleson-Hinds-McEntire House. After the Union victory in the Battle of Atlanta, a Confederate army under the command of Gen. John Bell Hood briefly sparred with a vastly outmanned garrison during the 1864 Battle of Decatur, when Decatur was referred to as A Tough Nut To Crack. While the city was under Confederate control, plans for the Battle of Shiloh were mapped out within the Burleson-Hinds-McEntire House.  These activities make the house one of the most historic buildings in Decatur. New Decatur, Alabama was a city that rose out of the ashes of former Decatur west of the railroad tracks.  New Decatur was founded in 1887 and incorporated in 1889. However, residents of the older Decatur resented the new town, founded and occupied by people who moved down from northern states. Animosity built until New Decatur renamed their town Albany, after Albany, N.Y., in September 1916.  The impetus to meld the two towns came from the need for a bridge, instead of a ferry, across the Tennessee River. The Decatur Kiwanis Club was formed with an equal number of members from each town to organize efforts to get the state to build the bridge. In 1925, the two cities merged to form one City of Decatur.  There is a noticeable difference between the two sides of town.  The cities developed differently at different times, and still to this day have  somewhat different cultures.  Eastern portions of Decatur tend to act more suburban and traditional, while western portions tend to look more metropolitan and contemporary. The Old State Bank, on the edge of downtown, is the oldest bank building in the State of Alabama, being 173 years old.  The first wave pool in the United States was built in Decatur and is still in operation at the Point Mallard Aquatic Center.  The city has the largest Victorian era home district in the state of Alabama.  Decatur is also home to Alabama's oldest opera house, the Cotaco Opera House, which still stands on Johnston Street. In the past its industries included repair shops of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, car works, engine works, bottling plants, and manufacturers of lumber, sashes and blinds, tannic acid, fertilizers, cigars, flour, cottonseed oil, and various other products. The Tennessee River has traditionally been the northern border of the city and Morgan County, while Flint Creek and the Wheeler Wildlife Refuge on the east side of the city.  The city does extend to the other side of Flint Creek and the Refuge in the Indian Hills and Burningtree subdivision areas.  There is also an inlet that extends one mile (2&nbsp;km) into the city limits from Wheeler Lake called Dry Branch.   There is also a small portion of Decatur that extends into Limestone County north along the Highway 31 corridor to the Calhoun College area and along Hwy 20 Corridor until it reaches I-65. The northern portion of Decatur sits on top of a short hill that overlooks the Tennessee River, this creates a very steep dropoff to the river shore at Rhodes Ferry Park.  This hill allows the "Steamboat Bill" Memorial Bridge to leave the mainland at grade without any major sloping required more height to cross the river while not interfering with Decatur's heavy barge traffic.  This hill extends from the banks of the river about  south to the 14th St./Magnolia St. intersection with 6th Avenue (US 31). South past the 14th St. and 6th Ave. intersection, land continues to remain flat.  South, and also west, past Alabama 67 there are a few minor mountains that sit within the city limits. Decatur is located at  (34.580992, −86.983392). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which,  of it is land and  of it (10.83%) is water. Decatur has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) with four distinct seasons. Winters are generally mild, with a January daily average temperature of . On average, the low temperature falls to the freezing mark or below on 59 days a year, and to or below  on 9.2 days. Winters usually do not produce much snow; a large amount of snow is rare within the city limits. A small, measurable amount of snow can be experienced a few times each year. In 2011, Decatur received up to  of snow in a single storm. It tied for the most since 1963.Summers are hot and humid with a July daily average temperature of . There are 51–52 days of + highs annually and 1.7 days of + highs. Thunderstorms are common during the summer months. The latter part of summer tends to be drier. Autumn, which spans from mid-September to early-December, tends to be similar to spring in terms of temperature and precipitation, although it begins relatively dry. Occasionally, severe thunderstorms occur. These storms can produce damaging winds and large hail in addition to the usual hazards of lightning and very heavy rain. There is also the risk of Tornadoes. Severe thunderstorms can occur at any time of the year but are most common during the spring months. There is a secondary severe weather season during the fall months. Tropical disturbances - some of which reach the Gulf Coast as Hurricanes but lose intensity as they move inland - can occasionally bring heavy rains. The highest recorded temperature was  on July 28, 1952 and August 16, 1954, while the lowest recorded temperature was  on January 30, 1966. Decatur is divided into four different regions of town (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest). Southeast and Northeast Decatur lie East of the CSX Railroad's mainline. North of Lee Street the dividing line is Bank Street which runs a block east of and parallel to the RR. Northeast & Southeast and are divided by Moulton Street.  Southwest consists of the area west of the CSX Railroad and south of Moulton Street.  Northwest is bordered by Moulton Street, the CSX Railroad from Moulton Street to Lee Street and then by Bank Street from Lee Street to the Tennessee River. While there are few major cultural differences between the East and the West, minute differences such as street grid patterns, zoning patterns, and architectural styles are noticeable. Northeast Limestone County Southeast Northwest Southwest The current mayor of Decatur is Don Kyle, who was elected in 2012[ ] The city has a five-member/district City Council. The current members are: There are also many boards and commissions run by the city, supervising schools, planning, downtown development, and so on. Past Decatur, AL Mayors include: 2012 City Elections: On October 9, former Decatur Mayor Don Kyle defeated opponent Carl Cole with a 56% margin to win his second term as Mayor.   The preliminary election, held on August 28, left incumbent Mayor Don Stanford with only 6% of the vote and Gail Busby with about 20%. City Council Elections showed Billy Jackson winning his 5th consecutive council term and Roger Anders and Gary Hammon also getting re-elected.   Councilman Charles Kirby was appointed the previous term when Ronny Russell resigned and he won his district without opposition.   Kirby was narrowly defeated by Russell in the 2008 election.   Councilman Greg Reeves did not seek re-election, and Charles Ard won District 5. Past Mayors and City Councilmen: The Public Safety Department consists of the Decatur Police Department and Decatur Fire & Rescue. The Public Safety annex is located at 4119 Old Highway 31 in the Flint Community at the south end of the city and houses the Fire Department's administrative offices. This is also the site of the fire and police training facilities. The Police and Fire Departments currently cover approx.  in and around the city. Both the Decatur Police and Decatur Fire & Rescue are dispatched by the Morgan County E-911 Center. The Decatur Police Department consists of 143 officers, assigned to 4 divisions (Operations, Traffic, Investigations, & Administration). The Decatur Fire & Rescue consists of approx. 140 firefighters. The department currently runs 7 Engine Companies, 5 Reserve Engines, 1 Reserve Ladder, 1 Ladder Companies, 1 Heavy Rescue, 1 Brush Truck, 1 HazMat Unit, 1 Shift Commander Vehicle, and several other staff and support vehicles out of 8 Fire Stations. Decatur is served by one ambulance services. First Response EMS, which began operations in July 2012 is a private company contracted through the city of Decatur to provide emergency medical services. Huntsville MedFlight, a division of Air Methods, and Air Evac Lifeteam provide aeromedical services for the city of Decatur and North Alabama. Decatur is served by two hospitals, Decatur General Hospital and Parkway Medical Center. Decatur General Hospital is a 273-bed, general acute care hospital and a 64-bed behavioral medicine hospital making it the third largest employer in Morgan County. Decatur General is accredited by the Joint Commission and its medical staff consists of more than 200 physicians representing 20 specialties. Decatur General Hospital is designated as a level two trauma center by the Alabama Department of Public Health. Parkway Medical Center is a 120-bed hospital that is designated as a level three trauma center by the Alabama Department of Public Health. As of January 1, 2012, Huntsville Hospital is the full owner of Parkway Medical Center. Parkway was formally a private not-for-profit hospital until their purchase from the public Huntsville Hospital System. Huntsville Hospital is the regions referral center and also serves as North Alabama's level one trauma center. As of November 2010 Decatur General Hospital and Huntsville Hospital are affiliate hospitals, ensuring the continued tradition and excellence of public, not-for-profit health care in North Alabama.

Decatur has grown to be the busiest river port on the Tennessee River.  The Port of Decatur sees large amounts of barge traffic from up and down the Tennessee River, which has led to twenty Fortune 500 companies opening plants in the city. Decatur is also known as the "Home of Meow Mix", after the company bought a  facility in town, and now utilizes its riverfront property to ship the finished product up and down the Tennessee River. Being part of the Huntsville-Decatur CSA, the city lies within the region having the most engineers per capita in the nation. A recent BRAC Base realignment will bring a population, conservatively estimated at 5,000−10,000 people (not including their families), to the area surrounding Redstone Arsenal. Approval of the United Launch Alliance combined Lockheed-Martin and Boeing's rocket manufacturing contracts to a central location at the plant in Decatur.  All satellite launching rockets used by the U.S. government will be built in Decatur.  This approval brought over 230 new jobs to the Decatur area.  The ULA plant utilizes the Tennessee River to ship the rockets to Cape Canaveral. In March 2008, a $1.3 billion development, including a Bass Pro Shops was announced for the Interstate 65/Interstate 565 interchange inside the city limits.  The development, named Sweetwater, would have included more than  of retail space,  of medical and office space, 2,700 residences, and an entertainment venue with seating for up to 8,000 people.  A school, fire department, parks and lakes were expected to support the future development. As of Spring 2010, this project still seems to be on the horizon, but there is no set date for the project to start.   As of 2012, Bass Pro Shop has removed Decatur from its list of stores "Coming Soon" on its webpage.  In 2013, Mayor Don Kyle announced that the "Sweet Water" complex was back on track, but has not announced whether Bass Pro Shops will be involved or not.  Research from the Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity suggests that the economic impact of Bass Pro Shops is typically limited despite the large subsidies the company often receives. According to Decatur's 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,City of Decatur CAFR the top employers in the city are: Other large employers include:   Tourism is a major part of Decatur's economy.  Hundreds of thousands of people from in and out of town, and from many other countries and territories, attend some of the premier festivals in the South. The Alabama Jubilee, begun in 1978, is the oldest hot air balloon race south of the Kentucky Derby's Great Balloon Race (from 1973).  With visiting populations rising into 100,000, people crowd around more than 60 seven-story-tall balloons as they inflate.  Because of the Alabama Jubilee, Decatur has been named "The Ballooning Capital of Alabama" by the Alabama State Legislature. The Spirit of America Festival is one of the largest free 4 July festivals in the south. More than 65,000 people arrive in Decatur to watch annual celebrations and the Miss Spirit of America beauty pageant. (The contest was known as "Miss Point Mallard" from 1976 through 2013. It moved to the Princess Theater in 2014.) Riverfest is a celebration sponsored by the Decatur Jaycees.  Set at Ingalls Harbor, along the beautiful Tennessee River, barbecuers come from all over the country to try their luck at beating Big Bob Gibson's Barbecue, the seven-time world champion. Another large event in Decatur and North Alabama, the Racking Horse World Celebration attracts horses from around the world to compete in the largest Racking Horse competition.  Held in the Celebration Arena near Priceville, the celebration draws up to 75,000 fans and competitors each year.   The Decatur Daily has been the only major newspaper based in the Decatur Metropolitan Area since 1912, and one of the few family owned newspapers in Alabama.  It has an average daily circulation of 20,824 and a Sunday circulation of 23,840.  The paper circulates in the morning to an area that includes Morgan County, Lawrence County, and Limestone County, and parts of Cullman County, and Winston County The Huntsville Times is the only other newspaper with a larger circulation in the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area, and has been in circulation since 1996 to most area counties, when the Huntsville News closed. Before then, the News was the morning paper, and the Times was the afternoon paper. After the News closed, the Times remained an afternoon paper until 2004. Charter Communications, AT&T and Knology offer cable TV to Decatur. AT&T, Charter and Knology offer phone service to Decatur. With AT&T, Huntsville and Madison are local calls (Madison County only), but Athens is long distance. Decatur comes within  of Athens and touches Huntsville. AT&T has not kept pace with growth in the region as reported in the Huntsville Times/Decatur Daily/Athens-News-Courier. at&t/Huntsville/Athens/Decatur/Madison Decatur is served by two major airports.  The Huntsville International Airport, in suburban Huntsville is the second busiest airport in Alabama, behind Birmingham International Airport.  The city is also served by the busiest regional airport in Alabama, the Pryor Field Regional Airport.  Decatur, being only a mid-sized city, has not yet seen the conveniences of a major controlled access highway passing through the city limits. Decatur's main thoroughfares are 6th Avenue (US 31) and The Beltline (State Route 67). 6th Avenue begins as both SR 20, US 72 Alt., and U.S. 31 split after being carried by the twin-span "Steamboat Bill" Hudson Memorial Bridge that crosses Tennessee River at the north central part of town.  SR 20/Alternate U.S. 72 continues west towards The Shoals, after the Beltline begins in the vicinity of the Ascend Performance Materials LLC plant. 6th Avenue continues southward where it eventually intersects with Beltline Road.  After that intersection, 6th Avenue continues southward to Birmingham as Decatur Highway. Plans are under way to construct a controlled access beltway from Interstate 65 south of the city to Alternate U.S. 72 in Lawrence County, known as Veteran's Parkway. In addition, there are plans to transform Alabama Highway 20/Alternate U.S. 72 into an extension of Interstate 565 into the city. Governor Bob Riley has said  he will make sure that plans for the road will be put on the fast track, since more than 85 vehicle accidents occur on Highway 20's final approach into Decatur each year. The Beltline was built as a western bypass to relieve congestion on 6th Avenue. In doing so, however, this created another problem as sprawl quickly developed along the new arterial. Construction is currently under way to widen the road from four to six lanes, which was expected to be complete by 2012. As of August 2013 news reports, the project is well behind schedule and forecast to be into 2014 before it is completed. Large shipments can move from Decatur to the Atlantic Ocean via the Tennessee River to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The United States builds all of its large space launch vehicles in Decatur, and ships them to both Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base via this water route. Austin High and Decatur High are the two main high schools of the city. With the addition of the International Baccalaureate Program to Austin and Decatur High Schools, Decatur has become the first Alabama school system north of Birmingham and one of five in the state to offer the honors program for juniors and seniors (as of July 2006). All high school football and soccer teams compete in the 10,000 seat Ogle Stadium. However, both Austin and Decatur failed to make adequate yearly progress in 2006 as mandated in the No Child Left Behind Act.  The state said Austin's 86 percent graduation rate was four points too low. Decatur High missed in two categories: percent of special education students the system tested in reading and percent tested in math. The graduate rate was 76 percent. The only institution of higher education located within the Decatur city limits is Calhoun Community College.  It has three campuses; the main campus is located just north of the city on Highway 31.
