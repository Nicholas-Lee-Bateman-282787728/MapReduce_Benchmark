Graham is regarded by critics as one of the most dominant players of his era, having taken the Browns to league championship games every year between 1946 and 1955, winning seven of them. With Graham at quarterback, the Browns posted a record of 114 wins, 20 losses and four ties, including a 9–3 [[Winning percentage|win–loss record]] in the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]]. While most of Graham's statistical records have been surpassed in the modern era, he still holds the NFL record for career average [[Yards from scrimmage|yards gained]] per [[Forward pass#American and Canadian football|pass attempt]], with 8.98. He also holds the record for the [[Most wins by a starting quarterback (NFL)|highest career winning percentage]] for an NFL starting quarterback, at 0.814. Long-time [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]], a friend of Graham's, once called him "as great of a quarterback as there ever was."<ref name="Graham obit" /> He is also known for being one of only two people (the other being Gene Conley—Milwaukee Braves in the 1957 World Series and three Boston Celtics championships from 1959–61) to win championships in two of the four major American sports—1946 NBL (became NBA) and AAFC Championship, plus 3 more AAFC and 3 NFL championships.  Graham grew up in [[Waukegan, Illinois]], the son of music teachers. He entered [[Northwestern University]] in 1940 on a basketball scholarship, but football soon became his main sport. After a brief stint in the military at the end of [[World War II]], Graham played during the 1946 season for the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League's]] [[Sacramento Kings|Rochester Royals]], who won the league championship that year. [[Paul Brown]], Cleveland's coach, signed Graham to play for the Browns, where he thrived. After he retired from playing football in 1955, Graham coached college teams in the [[College All-Star Game]] and became head football coach at the [[Coast Guard Academy]] in [[Connecticut]]. After seven years at the academy, he spent three unsuccessful seasons as head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]]. Following his resignation, he returned to the Coast Guard Academy, where he served as athletic director until his retirement in 1984. He was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1965.  ==Early life and college career==  Born in [[Waukegan, Illinois]], Graham's first interest growing up was music.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=19}} Encouraged by his parents, both of whom were music teachers, he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, [[cornet]] and [[French horn]].{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=79}}{{sfn|Boyer|2006|p=12}} Graham also excelled in athletics, and attended [[Northwestern University]] on a basketball scholarship in 1940.<ref name="Schwartz on Graham">{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=Larry|title='Automatic Otto' defined versatility|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014210.html|accessdate=August 24, 2012|newspaper=ESPN.com|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A9YSqdkZ|archivedate=August 24, 2012}}</ref> There he played on the [[Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball|varsity basketball team]] as a [[freshman]] and continued to study music.{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}}<ref name="Graham primary-source bio">{{cite web|title="Otto" Biography|url=http://www.ottograham.net/biography/|publisher=Ottograham.net|accessdate=August 24, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A9YlgJSy|archivedate=August 24, 2012}}</ref> Graham did not take up football until his [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] year, when Northwestern coach [[Pappy Waldorf]] saw him throwing in an [[Intramural sports|intramural]] game and invited him to practice with the team.<ref name="Schwartz on Graham" />{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} Northwestern's coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced him to sign up.<ref name="Schwartz on Graham" />{{sfn|LaTourette|2005|p=54}} Although football became Graham's primary sport, he also played [[Northwestern Wildcats baseball|baseball]] and continued on the basketball team.
