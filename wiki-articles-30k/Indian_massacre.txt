   In the history of the European colonization of North America, an atrocity termed "Indian massacre" is a specific incident wherein a group of people (military, mob or other) deliberately kill a significant number of relatively defenseless or innocent people—usually civilian noncombatants or to the summary execution of prisoners-of-war. The term pertains to the killings of people of European descent by indigenous people of the North American continent (Indians) or killings of indigenous people by people of European descent and/or other indigenous people. It is difficult to determine the total number of people who died as a result of Indian massacres.  However, one book, The Wild Frontier: Atrocities during the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee presents an estimate by counting every recorded atrocity in the area that would eventually become the continental United States, from first contact (1511) to the closing of the frontier (1890).  The parameters were limited to the intentional and indiscriminate murder, torture, or mutilation of civilians, the wounded, and prisoners. The results revealed that 7,193 people died from atrocities perpetrated by those of European descent, and 9,156 people died from atrocities perpetrated by Native Americans.Osborn, William M. (2001).
