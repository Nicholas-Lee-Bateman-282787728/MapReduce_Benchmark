   The Kingpin (real name Wilson Fisk) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is portrayed as one of the most feared and powerful crime lords in the Marvel Universe, typically holding the position of New York City's crime overlord. The Kingpin first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #50. Initially an adversary of Spider-Man, the character later became the archenemy of Daredevil,top 5 enemies of Daredevil, comicbooked.com and a recurring foe of the Punisher. IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains Of All Time List ranked The Kingpin as number 10. The Kingpin's signature look is his extraordinarily heavyset appearance, with most of his mass consisting of muscle. He usually wears a white suit jacket and carries a walking stick, which he tips with diamonds or other hard substances as necessary to aid his physical combat. The name "Kingpin" is a reference to the title crime lord in mafia slang nomenclature. Wilson Fisk is played by Michael Clarke Duncan in the 2003 film Daredevil, and by Vincent D'Onofrio in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  The Kingpin first appears in The Amazing Spider-Man #50 (July 1967), and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita, Sr, who based his physical appearance on actor Sydney Greenstreet. In his debut story arc in The Amazing Spider-Man #50â€“52, the Kingpin is portrayed purely as a mob boss, albeit one who tends to be unusually hands-on in his criminal dealings. In his subsequent appearances in the series, also written by Lee, he is developed into more of a typical supervillain, employing fantastic devices to further his criminal capers. In the early 1980s the character took a sharp turn in his characterization. A series of appearances in Daredevil by writer/penciler Frank Miller depicted the Kingpin as a scheming, cold-blooded crime lord who consistently stays beyond the reach of the law. This take on the character would remain the dominant one for decades, and the Kingpin became widely regarded as Daredevil's archenemy.top 5 enemies of Daredevil, comicbooked.com He continues to be a recurring opponent of Spider-Man, Daredevil, and the Punisher. Wilson Fisk began his life as a poor child in New York City, bullied by his classmates due to his obesity. Fisk began training himself in physical combat, using his new-found strength to intimidate the bullies into joining his gang. He was eventually discovered by crime lord Don Rigoletto. Fisk became Don Rigoletto's bodyguard and right-hand man. Eventually, Fisk killed Don Rigoletto and took control of his criminal empire, immediately becoming one of the most powerful figures in New York's underworld. While the Kingpin enjoyed a long tenure in his new position, he had made enemies such as the Maggia crime syndicate and the terrorist group HYDRA. The two groups teamed together to oppose Fisk, causing him to flee to Japan. There, he started a spice business in order to regain his wealth. After earning enough money, Fisk returned to New York and started gang wars, in an attempt to bring down the Maggia. With the criminal world in chaos, Fisk was able to step in and take back control.

Jonah Jameson, but was foiled by Spider-Man in his first confrontation with the web-slinger.The Amazing Spider-Man #50-52. Marvel Comics While Fisk was a powerful crime lord, he posed as a legitimate businessman, one who made donations to charities, and seemed like a generous, wealthy man.

He regained control of the New York mobs because he had built them up in the first place and knew how to damage them; promises to keep the East Coast stable kept Midwestern crime lords happy and allowed him room to move. The Kingpin also gained Bullseye's loyalty by promising steady work. The files were taken by Daredevil; Kingpin encouraged him to turn them over to the police as that would allow him to replace the arrested crime lords that much swifter.

The Kingpin has a small role in Marvel vs. DC, when he purchases the Daily Planet, firing Perry White and replacing him with J. Jonah Jameson.

In "The Big Brainwasher", Kingpin has opened a club that Mary Jane has gotten a job at where she takes pictures of city officials and the camera mesmerizes them to enter a room where Kingpin has them brainwashed. Spider-Man stops Kingpin's plot and he and his henchmen are handed over to the police. Kingpin appeared in the Spider-Woman episode "The Kingpin Strikes Again". In that episode, he was first seen trying to loot a bank with a band of capable henchmen. Though initially thwarted by the timely arrival of Spider-Woman, she herself was foiled when she left herself wide open to attack by sticking to a wall, and one of Kingpin's henchmen with a jackhammer used the contraption to shake the surface the heroine was sticking on, causing Spider-Woman to fall into a cell, holding her at bay. He later finds out Jessica Drew is the Spider-Woman and shares this knowledge with the world. In the end, she uses a robot to make everybody (including the Kingpin) think he made a mistake.

Kingpin appears in the Spider-Man: The New Animated Series episode "Royal Scam", voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan. In this series, the Kingpin is depicted as an African-American and uses a red diamond-studded cane capable of shooting lasers. Here, the Kingpin manipulated Spider-Man into thinking he worked for the FBI and assigned the superhero to steal a chip from the mob (they were actually innocent scientists). Spider-Man soon realized he was scammed (evidenced when he learned that the first FBI agent he met is just a movie actor). With the help of Harry Osborn and the real FBI, Spider-Man had the Kingpin behind bars after a confrontation in one of the Kingpin's helicopters. When the copter crashed, both of them successfully escaped and due to Kingpin's weight, he fell from Spider-Man's hand. However, the superhero saved him and had him trapped behind a crate long enough for the FBI to arrest him. In the Netflix TV series Daredevil, Wilson Fisk is portrayed by Vincent D'Onofrio. He is portrayed in childhood flashbacks by Cole Jensen. As a young boy, Fisk grew up in Hell's Kitchen, the son of Bill Fisk, an abusive, cruel and driven man trying to make a name for himself and his wife Marlene Vistain. One night, Bill got inebriated and attacked Marlene, which provoked Wilson to kill his father by striking him repeatedly over the back of the head with a hammer. Wilson and his mother dismembered Bill's body and dumped pieces of it into the river every night, followed by Fisk going to live with some relatives for a while with Fisk keeping his father's cuff links as a reminder to never to be like his father. In the 2010s, Fisk has become a criminal businessman with corrupt ties to multiple people, helping carefully build a criminal enterprise by recruiting branches of the Triad, the Yakuza, and the Russian mob, his number two James Wesley, financial expert Leland Owlsley, mob enforcer Turk Barrett, Parish Landman of the law firm Landman & Zack LLP, Senator Randolph Cherryh, lead editor Ellison's secretary Caldwell at the New York Bulletin, several cops from the New York City Police Department's 15th Precinct, and Melvin Potter. This has brought him into conflict with Daredevil. Fisk's network collapses when Detective Hoffman, one of the corrupt cops on Fisk's payroll, is saved by Daredevil and turns state's evidence, leading to the FBI arresting most of the conspirators in Fisk's enterprise. Intent on reuniting with his girlfriend Vanessa Marianna, Fisk orchestrates an escape attempt from the police convoy transporting him to Rikers Island to await trial, but is stopped when Daredevil tracks him to an alleyway and fights him, which ends when Daredevil knocks Fisk out.

David Banner (Bill Bixby) is unjustly arrested after interrupting an assault on a New York City subway by two thugs in the employ of Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin. Attorney Matt Murdock (Rex Smith) agrees to represent him, hoping to use information gleaned from Banner to bring down Fisk's organization. Banner and Murdock eventually learn about each other's secret lives as the Hulk and Daredevil, respectively. The pair is able to thwart Fisk's plans, but the Kingpin himself escapes. In the 2003 feature film Daredevil, he is played by Michael Clarke Duncan. When Duncan was cast, he weighed 290 pounds. He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin. In order to do this, he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day, and power-lifted, as well as eating whatever he wanted. Despite this, Duncan's biggest concern was that he is an African-American, while Kingpin had always been portrayed as European-American in the comics. He spoke on the fans' loyalty to the source material by saying "they watch movies to say, 'Hey, that's not like the comic book.' But I want them to get past that and just see the movie for what it is and see me for what I amâ€”an actor." After he hires Bullseye to kill Nikolas Natchios, Natchios' daughter, Elektra, vows revenge on Daredevil, whom she incorrectly concludes was the killer. After she learns the truth, however, she herself is killed by Bullseye. After Bullseye is defeated by Daredevil, Daredevil confronts the Kingpin, who unmasks Daredevil. Daredevil then breaks Fisk's legs and leaves him for the police, secure in his belief that the Kingpin will not reveal Daredevil's identity to the public, knowing that it would damage his reputation in the underworld if it were known that he was beaten by a blind man. As the police close in on him, Kingpin swears that he will get out of prison and take his revenge. Kingpin appears as the final boss of The Punisher.

Spider-Man then goes to the Kingpin's penthouse and after defeating the gang members and their bosses, he fights the Kingpin.

Due to the Symbiote invasion, Kingpin stays locked inside his heavily fortified office; however, Spider-Man manages to convince him to help with saving the city by providing the Tinkerer with the resources he needs to build a device to destroy the alien substance. If Spider-Man is dominated by the Black Suit, Kingpin allows Tinkerer and Black Widow to use his base to launch a new plan; they send Wolverine, who has gained control of a Symbiote, to bring back Spider-Man - dead or alive.
