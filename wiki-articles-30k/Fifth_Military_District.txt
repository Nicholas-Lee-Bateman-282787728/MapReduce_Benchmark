   The 5th Military District was a temporary administrative unit of the United States set up by the Reconstruction Acts during the Reconstruction period following the American Civil War.  It included Texas, from Brazos Santiago Harbor, (previously Port Matamoros), at the Mexican border, north to Louisiana.  General Philip Sheridan served as its first military governor, until removed by U.S. President Andrew Johnson because of a charge of excessive harshness in Sheridan's treatment of former Confederate soldiers. He was replaced by Charles Griffin, then by Joseph J. Reynolds. Several incidents committed against negro federal soldiers at Ft. Brown in Brownsville, Texas noted, and elsewhere by Jayhawkers, wild Indians, desperados, etc.  Most incident reports fail to identify the perpetrators. Among the United States Army forces stationed in Texas were the following units: The Following are a summary of U.S. Cavalry/Infantry activities in the 5th Military District of Texas from January 1866 to April 1870 – such as in pursuit of Native Americans and outlaws based on Official Reports and the 6th US Cavalry Regimental History and deaths/injuries to soldiers in the Fifth Military District.
