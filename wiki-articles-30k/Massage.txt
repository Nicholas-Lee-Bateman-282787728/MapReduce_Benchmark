    Massage involves working and acting on the body with pressure&nbsp;– structured, unstructured, stationary, or moving&nbsp;– tension, motion, or vibration, done manually or with mechanical aids. Massage can be applied with the hands, fingers, elbows, knees, forearm, feet, or a massage device. Massage can promote relaxation and well-being, can be a recreational activity, and can be sexual in nature (see Erotic massage). In professional settings massage clients are treated while lying on a massage table, sitting in a massage chair, or lying on a mat on the floor, while in amateur settings a general purpose surface like a bed or floor is more common. Aquatic massage and bodywork is performed with recipients submersed or floating in a warm-water therapy pool. The massage subject may be fully or partially clothed or unclothed. The word comes from the French massage "friction of kneading", or from Arabic massa meaning "to touch, feel" or from Latin massa meaning "mass, dough", cf. Greek verb μάσσω (massō) "to handle, touch, to work with the hands, to knead dough".μάσσω, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus In distinction the ancient Greek word for massage was anatripsis, and the Latin was frictio. Archaeological evidence of massage has been found in many ancient civilizations including China, India, Japan, Korea, Egypt, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[Greece]], and [[Mesopotamia]].

A typical commercial massage table has an easily cleaned, heavily padded surface, and a horseshoe-shaped head support that allows the client to breathe easily while lying face down and can be stationary or portable, while home versions are often lighter weight or designed to fold away easily. An [[orthopedic pillow]] or bolster can be used to correct body positioning.  Ergonomic chairs serve a similar function as a massage table. Chairs may be either stationary or portable models. Massage chairs are easier to transport than massage tables, and recipients do not need to disrobe to receive a chair massage. Due to these two factors, chair massage is often performed in settings such as corporate offices, outdoor festivals, shopping malls, and other public locations.  === Warm-water therapy pools === Temperature-controlled warm-water therapy pools are used to perform aquatic bodywork.<ref name=Osinski2011>Osinski, A. 2011.

These beds differ from a Vichy shower in that the client usually stays dry. Two common types are one in which the client lies on a waterbed-like mattress which contains warm water and jets of water and air bubbles and one in which the client lies on a foam pad and is covered by a plastic sheet and is then sprayed by jets of warm water, similar to a Vichy shower.<ref name="amiaspa">{{cite web|url=http://www.circlesoflight.com/alternative/water-jet-machine.html |title=Using a Water Massage Machine |publisher=Circlesoflight.com |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2013-02-26}}</ref> The first type is sometimes seen available for use in malls and shopping centers for a small fee.  === Vichy showers === A [[Vichy shower]] is a form of hydrotherapy which uses a series of shower nozzles which spray large quantities of water over the client while they lie in a shallow wet bed, similar to a massage table, but with drainage for the water. The nozzles may usually be adjusted for height, direction, and temperature to suit the clients needs.  === Cremes, Lotions, Gels, and Oils === Many different types of massage cremes, lotions, gels, and oils are used to lubricate and moisturize the skin and reduce the friction between skin ( hands of technician and client). lightly different properties, and the choice depends upon the type of massage and the therapist’s preference.

Examples are: * Registered Massage Therapist (RMT) Canada * Remedial Massage Therapist (RMT) New Zealand * Certified Massage Therapist (CMT) New Zealand * Licensed Massage Practitioner (LMP) * Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT) * Licensed Massage and Bodywork Therapist (LMBT) North Carolina * Therapeutic Massage Therapist (TMT) South Africa  In some jurisdictions, [[practicing without a license]] is a crime.  ==== Canada ==== In regulated provinces massage therapists are known as Registered Massage Therapists, in Canada only four [[provinces]] regulate massage therapy:<ref name=overviewca>{{cite web|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/news/upcomingmeetings/abstracts_mt/overview_canada.htm |title=Overview of Manual Therapy in Canada |last=Verhoef |first=M. |publisher=The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) |date=2005-06-10 |accessdate=2007-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20150527022820/http://nccih.nih.gov/news/upcomingmeetings/abstracts_mt/overview_canada.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2015 }}</ref> [[British Columbia]], [[Ontario]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[New Brunswick]].<ref name=law/> Regulated provinces have, since 2012, established inter-jurisdiction competency standards. {{cite web|url=http://www.cmto.com/cmto-wordpress/assets/Inter-Jurisdictional-Competency-Standards-June-2012.pdf |title=Inter-Jurisdiction Competency Standards |date=2012-06-10 }}  <ref name=overviewca/> [[Quebec]] is not provincially regulated.

Only someone who has completed 3,200 hours of training (theoretical and practical) can use the professional title "Masseur und Medizinischer Bademeister" or Medical Masseur and Spa Therapist.  This person can prolong his training depending on the length of professional experience to a Physiotherapist (1 year to 18 months additional training).  The Masseur is trained in Classical Massage, Myofascial Massage, Exercise and Movement Therapy.  During the training they will study: Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Gynecology, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Surgery, and probably most importantly Dermiatry and Orthopedics.  They are trained in [[Electrotherapy]], and Hydrotherapy.  Hydrotherapy includes: Kneipp, Wraps, underwater Massage, therapeutic washing, Sauna and Steambath.  A small part of their training will include special forms of massage which are decided by the local college, for example: Foot reflex zone massage, Thai Massage etc.  Finally a graduate is allowed to treat patients under the direction of a doctor.  He is regulated by the professional body which regulates Physiotherapists.  This includes the restriction on advertising and oath of confidentiality to clients.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  ==== India ==== In India, massage therapy is licensed by The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)]] in March 1995. Massage therapy is based on Ayurveda, the ancient medicinal system that evolved around 600 BC. In [[ayurveda]], massage is part of a set of holistic medicinal practices, contrary to the independent massage system popular in some other systems. In Siddha, Tamil traditional medicine from south India, massage is termed as "Thokkanam" and is classified in to nine types, each for specific variety of disease.  ==== Japan ==== In Japan, shiatsu is regulated but oil massage and Thai massage are not.

These businesses are often confined to a specific area of the city, such as the [[Zona Norte (Tijuana)|Zona Norte]] in [[Tijuana]].  ==== New Zealand ==== In New Zealand, massage is unregulated.  There are two levels of registration with Massage New Zealand, the professional body for massage therapists within New Zealand, although neither of these levels are government recognised.  Registration at the Certified Massage Therapist level denotes competency in the practice of relaxation massage.  Registration at the Remedial massage therapist denotes competency in the practice of remedial or orthopedic massage.  Both levels of registration are defined by agreed minimum competencies and minimum hours. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  ==== South Africa ==== In South Africa, massage is regulated, but enforcement is poor.  The minimum legal requirement to be able to practice as a professional massage therapist is a 2-year diploma in Therapeutic Massage and registration with The Allied Health Professions Council of SA (AHPCSA). The 2 year qualification includes 240 credits, about 80 case studies, and about 100 hours community service.  ==== South Korea ==== In [[South Korea]],  blind and visually impaired people can become licensed masseurs.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7699114.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blind S Korea masseurs win case | date=2008-10-30 | accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref>  ==== Thailand ==== In [[Thailand]], [[Thai massage]] is officially listed as one of the branches of [[traditional Thai medicine]], recognized and regulated by the government.
