    The Passion Play or Easter pageant is a dramatic presentation depicting the Passion of Jesus Christ: his trial, suffering and death. It is a traditional part of Lent in several Christian denominations, particularly in Catholic tradition. The development of the Passion Play was about the same as that of the Easter Drama. It originated in the ritual of the Church, which prescribes, among other things, that the Gospel on Good Friday should be sung in parts divided among various persons. Later on, the Passion Play made its appearance, first in Latin, then in vernacular languages; contents and forms were adapted more and more to audience expectations, until, in the fifteenth century, the popular religious plays had developed. Thus, the Benedictbeurn Passion Play (thirteenth century) is still largely composed of Latin ritual sentences in prose and of church hymns, and, being designed to be sung, resembles an oratorio. Yet even this oldest of the Passion Plays already shows a tendency to break away from the ritual and to adopt a more dramatic form.  This evolution is shown by the interpolation of free translations of church hymns and of German verses not pertaining to such hymns, as well as by the appearance of Mary (the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene in the action. From these humble beginnings the Passion Play developed very rapidly, since in the fourteenth century it was at a stage of development which could not have been reached except by repeated practice. From this second period we have the Vienna Passion, the St. Gall Passion, the oldest Frankfort Passion, and the Maestricht Passion. All four Plays, as they are commonly called, are written in rhyme, principally in German. The Vienna Passion embraces the entire history of the Redemption, and begins with the revolt and fall of Lucifer; the play, as transmitted to us, ends with Jesus and his Twelve Apostles sitting at the Last Supper. The oldest Frankfort Passion play, that of Canon Baldemar von Peterwell (1350–1381), the production of which required two days, was more profusely elaborated than the other Passion Plays of this period. Of this play only the Ordo sive Registrum has come down to us, a long roll of parchment for the use of the director, containing stage directions and the first words of the dialogues. The plays based on this list of directions lead us to the period in which the Passion Play reached its highest development (1400–1515). During this period the later Frankfort Passion Play (1467), the Alsfelder, and the Friedberger (1514) originated. Connected with this group are the Eger, the Donaueschingen, Augsburg, Freising and Lucerne Passion Plays, in which the whole world drama, beginning with the creation of man and brought down to the coming of the Holy Ghost, is exhibited, and which was produced with great splendour as late as 1583. Nearly all these Passion Plays have some relation to those coming from the Tyrol, some contributing to, others taking from, that source. These, again, are founded upon the Tyrolese Passion play which originated during the transition period of the fourteenth to the fifteenth century. Historian J. E. Wackernell, with the aid of the plays that have reached us, has reconstructed this period. In Tyrol the Passion Plays received elaborate cultivation; at Bolzano they were presented with great splendour and, in 1514, lasted no less than seven days.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://cma.gbv.de/dr,cma,007,2004,a,07.pdf |title=The Social Stages of the City.

The artistic sense and the [[Aesthetics|love of art]] of the citizens had, in co-operation with the clergy, called these plays into being, and the wealth of the citizens provided for magnificent productions of them on the public squares, whither they migrated after expulsion from the churches. The citizens and civil authorities considered it a point of honour to render the production as rich and diversified as possible. Ordinarily the preparations for the play were in the hands of a spiritual brotherhood, the play itself being considered a form of [[worship]]. People of the most varied classes took part in the production, and frequently the number of actors was as high as two hundred and even greater. If was undoubtedly no small task to drill the performers, particularly since the [[set design|stage arrangements]] were still very primitive.  ===Staging and set design=== The [[Stagecraft|stage]] was a wooden structure, almost as broad as it was long, elevated but slightly above the ground and open on all sides. A house formed the background; a [[balcony]] attached to the house represented [[Heaven]]. Under the balcony three [[cross]]es were erected. Sometimes the stage was divided into three sections by [[stage door|doors]]. Along the sides of the stage, taken lengthwise, stood the houses required for the production; they were indicated by fenced-in spaces, or by four posts upon which a roof rested. The [[Gates of Hell|entrance into]] [[Hell]] was pictured by the mouth of a monster, through which the [[Devil]] and the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s captured or released during the plays passed back and forth. The actors entered in solemn procession, led by musicians or by a præcursor ([[herald]]), and took their stand at the places appointed them. They remained on the stage all through the performance; they sat on the barriers of their respective divisions, and were permitted to leave their places only to [[dialogue (fiction)|recite]] their lines. As each actor finished speaking, he returned to his place. The audience stood around the stage or looked on from the windows of neighbouring houses. Occasionally platforms, called "bridges", were erected around the stage in the form of an [[amphitheatre]].  ===Simplicity of scenery, dialog, action, and costumes=== The [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]] was the background of old time middle east. There were no side [[scene (fiction)|scenes]], and consequently no stage perspective. Since an illusion of reality could not be had, indications were made to suffice. Thus a cask standing on end represents the mountain on which Christ is tempted by the Devil; [[thunder]] is imitated by the report of a gun; in order to signify that the Devil had [[Demonic possession|entered into him]], [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] holds a bird of black plumage before his mouth and makes it flutter. The suicide of Judas is an execution, in which [[Beelzebub]] performs the hangman's duty. He precedes the culprit up the ladder and draws Judas after him by a [[rope]]. Judas has a black bird and the [[intestines]] of an animal concealed in the front of his clothing, and when Satan tears open the garment the bird flies away, and the intestines fall out, whereupon Judas and his executioner slide down into Hell on a rope. A [[painting|painted picture]] representing the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], is hung from the mouth of each of the two [[thief|thieves]] on the cross; an [[angel]] takes the soul of the [[penitent]], the devil that of the impenitent thief. Everything is presented in the concrete, just as the [[imagination]] of the audience pictures it, and the scenic conditions, resembling those of the antique theatre demand. All [[costume]], however, is contemporary, historical accuracy being ignored.  ===Secularization of the Passion Play=== The Passion Plays of the 15th century, with their peculiar blending of religious, artistic, and increasingly secular [[Dramatic structure|elements]], gave a true picture of German city life of those times. Serious thought and lively humour were highly developed in these plays. When, however, the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]], in the sixteenth century, withdrew more and more from the plays, the plays, left to the lower classes, began to lose their serious and (in spite of the comic traits) dignified character. The influence of the Carnival plays (Fastnachtspiele) was felt more and more. Master Grobianus with his coarse and [[obscenity|obscene]] jests was even introduced into some of the Passion Plays. In time the [[ecclesiastical]] authorities forbade the production of these "secularized"{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} plays. Thus, the [[Bishop of Havelberg]] commanded his clergy, in 1471, to suppress the Passion Plays and legend plays in their parish districts because of the disgraceful and irrelevant [[farce]]s interspersed through the productions.  ===Secularized Passion Plays banned=== With the advent of the 16th-century European religious conflict the uneasiness with [[liturgical drama]] in general increased. The [[Synod]] of [[Strasbourg|Strasburg]] of 1549 opposed the religious plays, and the year previous, in 1548, the [[Parliament of Paris]] forbade the production of ''The Mysteries of the Passion of our Redeemer and other Spiritual Mysteries''. One consequence was that the secularized plays were separated from the religious, and, as Carnival plays, held the public favour. The Passion Plays came to be presented more rarely, particularly as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was inimical to them.  ==Rediscovery of the Passion Play==  ===The Passion Play almost disappears=== School dramas now came into vogue in Catholic and Protestant schools, and frequently enough became the battle-ground of religious [[controversies]]. When, in the 17th century, the splendidly equipped [[Jesuit drama]] arose, the Passion Plays (still largely secularized) were relegated to out-of-the-way [[villages]] and to the [[monasteries]], particularly in [[Bavaria]] and [[Austria]]. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, during the [[The Enlightenment|Age of Enlightenment]], efforts were made in Catholic Germany, particularly in Bavaria and the Tyrol, to destroy even the remnants of the tradition of [[medieval]] plays.  ===A resurgence of public interest=== Public interest in the Passion Play developed in the last decades of the 19th century, and the statistician [[Karl Pearson]] wrote a book about them.  Since then, [[Brixlegg]] and Vorderthiersee in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [http://www.ckrumlov.cz/uk/region/histor/t_pasije.htm Horice na Sumave, near Cesky Krumlov] in the [[Czech Republic]], and above all, the [[Oberammergau]] in [[Upper Bavaria]] attract thousands to their plays.  The text of the play of Vorderthiersee (''Gespiel in der Vorderen Thiersee'') dates from the second half of the seventeenth century, is entirely in verse, and comprises in five [[Act (theater)|acts]] the events recorded in the Gospel, from the Last Supper to the Entombment. A prelude (Vorgespiel), on the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]], precedes the play. After being repeatedly remodelled, the text received its present classical form from the Austrian [[Benedictine]], [[P. Weissenhofer]]. Productions of the play, which came from Bavaria to the Tyrol in the second half of the eighteenth century, were arranged at irregular intervals during the first half of the nineteenth century; since 1855 they have taken place at regular intervals, at Brixlegg every ten years. The Höritz Passion Play, the present text of which is from the pen of Provost Landsteiner, has been produced every five years, since 1893.  ==Modern performances of the Passion Play==  ===The Oberammergau Passion Play=== The chief survivor of former times is the [[Oberammergau Passion Play]], first performed in the Bavarian village of [[Oberammergau]] in 1634, and now performed every ten years.  ;''Oberammergau Passion Play 2010'' [[File:Oberammergau Theatre IMG 4083.JPG|thumb|Oberammergau Theatre. 2013]] About half the inhabitants of Oberammergau take part in the once-a-decade Passion Play in the year 2010.  This means that over 2,000 villagers brought the story of Jesus of Nazareth to life for the audiences that flocked in from around the world. In according with tradition, the play started with Jesus entering Jerusalem, continuing with his death on the cross and finishing with the resurrection. As ever, this was an extraordinary community enterprise.  2010 saw a new production directed by Christian Stückl, director at Munich's noted Volkstheater. He was supported by the artistic team that, along with him, staged the 2000 Passion Play: deputy director and dramatic adviser Otto Huber, set and costume designer Stefan Hageneier, music director Marxus Zwink, and conductor Michael Bocklet. All four of these collaborators are from Oberammergau. The play started at 14.30 and included a three-hour interval, ending at 22.30. Performances took place between mid-May and early October 2010.  The next Oberammergau Passion Play will take place in 2020.  ===Australia=== * In Australia, there are several major productions of The Passion staged annually in the lead up to Easter. * [http://www.passionplay.org.au The Iona Passion Play] was founded in 1958 in [[Queensland]] and tours cities and towns around Australia. In each location the touring cast invites community members to join the production.  * A New group of enthusiastic people staged a version of the Passion Play with music and script written by Roy Pires in a completely original score. It was staged for the first time in 2007 at Riverstage in the City botanical gardens in [[Brisbane, Queensland]] and was very successful, touching the lives of many people."  * In [[New South Wales]], at [[Turramurra]], ''The Turramurra Passion'' is a contemporary, character-driven interpretation, using multimedia elements and an original score[[File:Thelaketheatre.jpg|thumb|The Lake Theatre, Moogerah Queensland Australia]] * The ''Moogerah Passion Play'' is produced in [[Queensland]], and is staged "realistically" on a large outdoor stage beside a lake. The Moogerah Passion Play was established in 1993, and continues to be performed annually at Easter time. The performance is held each year at The Lake Theatre, a purpose built theatre which has been designed specifically for the Moogerah Passion Play. Contemporary versions of the play endevour to use different Bibles to convey messages to the audience every year.   ===Brazil=== [[Image:Nova-Jerusalém-Fórum-Pilatos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Roman Forum stage, in [[New Jerusalem theater|New Jerusalem]]]] The Passion of the Christ is performed every year during Easter in a purpose-built {{convert|100000|m2|sing=on}} theatre-city in the arid backlands of [[Pernambuco]], in northeastern [[Brazil]]. It is considered to be the largest open-air theatre in the world. Thousands of visitors arrive every year to watch the performance; over 500 actors appear on the nine separate stages within the stone walls of the [[New Jerusalem theater|New Jerusalem]] city-theatre.  ===Canada=== * [[The Canadian Badlands Passion Play]] is performed annually in [[Drumheller]], Alberta. It is staged outdoors in a naturally occurring [[amphitheatre]] in the hills of the Drumheller valley. Performers are a mix of professionals and volunteers from across Alberta and Canada, with nearly 300 actors and musicians annually.  * In [[Queensway Cathedral]] ([[Toronto]], Ontario) a Passion Play takes place during the Easter Season. For more than 20 years the Church on the Queensway (formally Queensway Cathedral) has presented different versions of the Passion Play in their 3200-seat venue using hundreds of volunteers, live animals, singers and dancers.  The play has become a favorite and most shows experience capacity crowds.  This presentation is known for its powerful portrayal of the life of Christ, dramatic resurrection, and ascension scenes.  There is also a well-known Passion Play in Vaughan, Ontario organized by St. Peters Parish and performed at [[Holy Cross Catholic Academy]].  * In [[Manitoba]], located in the La Riviere Valley at Oak Valley's Outdoor theatre, located on the edge of the valley among the natural beauty of the Pembina Valley. The cast and crew are all volunteers from all over southern Manitoba. Rehearsals usually start in April or early May and are ready for mid-July performances.  * In [[Kingston, Ontario]], a full-scale Passion Play production has been traditionally performed for decades at the [[Kingston Gospel Temple]], a Pentecostal worship center.  The production features local amateur and professional talent.  * In [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Cardinal Newman Catholic Secondary School puts on a Passion Play annually for all the students who attend it.  * In [[Thornhill, Ontario]], in what has become an annual tradition at St. Joseph the Worker Parish, over 200 parish youth and young adults annually come together to present the LIfe and Passion of Christ, the decisive event in history that gave victory to hope, love, light, and life. Every year, the StJW Parish Passion Play increases in quality and number as the bar continues to be raised. Funds raised from the Passion Play go to subsidize the StJW Youth's annual trip to the Steubenville Youth Conference.  ===Malta=== The island nation of [[Malta]] features many Passion Plays, put on by provincial theatres, clubs and societies in various localities. Each village and town often hosts several plays and there is some competition between the troupes to put on the most moving, or beautiful display. These are often combined with processions and ''wirjiet'' ("exhibitions") that feature models and renditions of the Passion. Since 2007, a Passion Play entitled [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Il-Mixja-2013/545028902185445 "Il-Mixja"] with Jesus being played by popular Maltese actor Alan Fenech and featuring some of the most highly acclaimed actors in Malta has become one of the highlights of the genre on the island with the audience experiencing the passion of Jesus Christ as if they were present on the streets of Jeruslaem during those historical two days. The play is held outdoors and has so far been held 4 times in the streets of Rabat, once at Ħaġar Qim temples and twice (in 2013 and 2014) for charity on the grounds surrounding Mount Carmel Hospital.  ===The Netherlands=== ''De Passiespelen'' is a re-enactment of the Passion of the Christ taking place every year that is divisible by 5, e.g. 2005 and 2010. It is performed in the open air in [[Openluchttheater De Doolhof]] in [[Tegelen]]. Originating in 1931 it has become an internationally acclaimed event drawing visitors from all over the world.  The Passion is a huge event, performed since 2011 during the evening of Maundy Thursday. The open-air event is performed each year at another place, in 2013 in [[The Hague]] in the close proximity of the Dutch parliament buildings. The event, being the Dutch adaptation of the [[Manchester Passion]], is live broadcast by the Dutch television channel [[Nederland 3]].  ===Philippines=== [[File:Jesus Christ Pagtaltal 2010.jpg|thumb|Actor portraying Jesus on the cross during the ''Pagtaltal'' in Barotac Viejo, [[Iloilo]], Philippines, April 2010.]]The predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Philippines]] has Passion Plays called ''Senákulo'', named after the [[Cenacle|Upper room]], every ''[[Holy Week in the Philippines|Semana Santa]]'' (Holy Week). Theatre companies and community groups perform different versions of the ''Senákulo'', using their own scripts that present the dialogue in either poetic or prosaic form. These scripts are decades or even centuries-old, and draw from both the Bible and folk tradition.  Costumes and scenery in traditional Senákulo conform to Hispanic iconography instead of actual [[historical realism]], which is more common with recent productions (particularly by professional companies). Some productions use ropes to hold actors on crosses while others use actual nails.<ref>{{cite news|title=In pictures: Philippines crucifixions|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1901095.stm | work=BBC News | date=29 March 2002}}</ref>   One of the more popular Senákulo is ''Ang Pagtaltal sa Balaan Bukid'' in [[Jordan, Guimaras|Jordan]], [[Guimaras]], which began in 1975 and draws some 150,000 visitors annually <ref>{{cite web|title=Pagtaltal article in "The News Today"|url=http://www.thenewstoday.info/2009/04/08/pagtaltal.sa.balaan.bukid.will.retell.the.worlds.greatest.story.html|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> Some people perform crucifixions outside of Passion Plays to fulfill a ''panatà''  (vow for a request or prayer granted), such as the famous penitents in Barangay [[San Pedro Cutud]], [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], [[Pampanga]].  ===Poland=== Tradition of Passion Plays in [[Poland]] has become popular again in the early 20th century. Today the best known plays take place in Kałków, Kalwaria Pacławska, the [[Pallotines]]' Seminary in Ołtarzew, and the most prominent in [[Sanctuary]] of [[Kalwaria Zebrzydowska]]. This Passion Play is one of the oldest. Since 1998 there has been a yearly Passion Play in Poznan, performed on Palm Sunday in open air of Cytadela City Park. Now it is the biggest performance of this kind in Europe. In 2009 one hundred thousand pilgrims are expected to come.  ===Slovenia=== In the 17th and 18th century, Passion Plays were also organised in the towns of the [[Slovene Lands]], like [[Kranj]], [[Ljubljana]], and [[Novo Mesto]].

They depict the events of Jesus Christ’s trial, death and resurrection and may also extend to the events of his life, works and miracles. Today they are performed at Easter and often take place in public spaces such as city centres and town squares as free, community-led performances.  Popular biblical dramas of the Middle Ages - including liturgical drama, Passion Plays and the Corpus Christi cycles or Mystery Play - are the originators of modern Passion Plays.

[http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/newsletter/2004/feb20.html "Why some Jews fear ''The Passion''"], ''[[Christianity Today]]'', 2004.</ref>  The [[Religion Newswriters Association]] observed that <blockquote>"in Easter 2001, three incidents made national headlines and renewed their fears. One was a column by [[Paul Weyrich]], a conservative Christian leader and head of the [[Free Congress Foundation]], who argued that "Christ was crucified by the Jews." Another was sparked by comments from the NBA point guard and born-again Christian [[Charlie Ward]], who said in an interview that Jews were persecuting Christians and that Jews "had his [Jesus'] blood on their hands." Finally, the evangelical Christian comic strip artist [[Johnny Hart]] published a B.C. strip that showed a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] disintegrating until it became a cross, with each panel featuring the last words of Jesus, including "[[Sayings of Jesus on the cross#Father forgive them2C for they know not what they do|Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do]]".<ref name=religionlink>[http://www.religionlink.org/tip_040120a.php "'Passion' plays out locally"] February 17, 2004</ref> </blockquote>  On 16 November 1998, Church Council of [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] similarly adopted a resolution prepared by its Consultative Panel on Lutheran-Jewish Relations urging any Lutheran church presenting a Passion Play to adhere to their ''Guidelines for Lutheran-Jewish Relations'', stating that "the New Testament . . . must not be used as justification for hostility towards present-day Jews," and that "blame for the death of Jesus should not be attributed to Judaism or the Jewish people."<ref>Evangelical Lutheran Church in America [http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Ecumenical-and-Inter-Religious-Relations/Inter-Religious-Relations/Christian-Jewish-Relations/Guidelines.aspx "Guidelines for Lutheran-Jewish Relations"] 16 November 1998</ref><ref>World Council of Churches [http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/interreligious/cd33-23.html "Guidelines for Lutheran-Jewish Relations"] in [http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/interreligious/cd33-01.html Current Dialogue, Issue 33] July 1999</ref>  In 2003 and 2004 some people compared [[Mel Gibson]]'s recent film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' to these kinds of Passion Plays, but this characterization is hotly disputed; an analysis of that topic is in the article on [[The Passion of the Christ]]. Despite such fears, there have been no publicized antisemitic incidents directly attributable to the movie's influence.  ==Supporters of Passion Plays==  ===Passion Trust===  [[File:Passion Trust logo.png|thumb|right|Passion Trust Logo 2014]]  The Passion Trust supports the resurgence of Passion Plays in the United Kingdom through resourcing, networking, advocating and financing new and existing plays.

Established in 1982, this umbrella organisation draws together Passion Play communities from countries all over Europe, some of which have been performing their plays for hundreds of years.  According to Mons. Fausto Panfili, the Chaplain of the Europassion:  ''The experience of the Europassion constantly lets us experience a so far unexplored pathway, so that we can continue to grow.Surmounting a self-referred vision of our own experience obligates us to confront a regional, national, European and universal horizon. That is why a new vision, not fragmentary, is necessary. Unity doesn’t mean uniformity. A spiritual energy, stronger and more attentive to cultural elaboration, a more evident solidarity in order to be recognised as bearers of hope, to help the people and communities grow.<ref>{{cite web|title=Europassion|url=http://www.europassion.net/en/salutaion/|website=Europassion|accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref>  ==See also== {{colbegin||27em}} * [[Arrest of Jesus]] * [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] * [[Christian drama]] * [[Dramatic portrayals of Jesus]] * {{nowrap|[[Easter Drama]]}} * [[Gospel]] * [[Jesus Christ]] * [[Morality play]] * [[Mummers Play]] * [[Mystery play]] * [[Resurrection of Jesus]] * [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] * [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus]] * [[Ta'ziya]] — a [[Shia Islam|Shiite Muslim]] Passion Play ([[ta'zieh]]) commemorating the [[martyr]]dom of [[Husayn bin Ali]] {{colend}}  ==References== {{Reflist|2}}  ==External links== {{Commons category|Passion plays}} *[http://www.oberammergau-passion.com Official English Website for the Oberammergau Passion Play 2010] *[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/445807/Passion-play Encyclopedia Britannica entry for Passion play]  {{Authority control}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Passion Play}} [[Category:Art of the Passion]] [[Category:Medieval drama]] [[Category:Stage portrayals of Jesus]] [[Category:Theatrical genres]]
