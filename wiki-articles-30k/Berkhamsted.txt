    Berkhamsted  is a medium-sized historic market town on the western edge of Hertfordshire, England. The affluent commuter town is located in the small Bulbourne valley in the Chiltern Hills,  northwest of London. Berkhamsted is a civil parish, with a town council within the larger borough of Dacorum. People have been living in the Berkhamsted area for over 5,000 years, including evidence of flint working in the Neolithic period and metal working in the late Iron Age and Roman periods. The high street is on a pre-Roman route known by its Saxon name Akeman Street. The earliest written reference to Berkhamsted is in 970AD. Berkhamsted was recorded as a 'burbium' (an ancient borough) in the Domesday Book in 1086. The oldest known extant [[jettied]] timber-framed building in Great Britain, built 1277 - 1297, survives as a shop on the town's high street.<ref name="EH173">{{NHLE|num=1246942|desc=173 High Street, Berkhamsted |accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="BBC173">{{cite news|date=26 February 2003 |publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2801215.stm|title=Restoration boost for oldest shop|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref> In the 13th and 14th century the town was a [[Medieval English wool trade|wool trad]]<nowiki/>ing town, with thriving local market.  The most important event in the town's history was in December 1066. After [[William the Conqueror]] defeated [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold's]] [[Anglo-Saxon]] army at the [[Battle of Hastings]], the Anglo-Saxon leadership surrendered to the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman]] [[Military camp|encampment]] at Berkhamsted. The event was recorded in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]. From 1066 to 1495, [[Berkhamsted Castle]] was a favoured residence held by many English royals, including [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and [[Edward, the Black Prince]]; and historical figures such as [[Thomas Becket]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chilternsaonb.org/ccbmaps/1318/137/berkhamsted-castle.html|title=Berkhamsted Castle|publisher=Chilterns Conservation Board|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> After the castle was abandoned in 1495 the town went into decline, losing its borough status in the second half of the 17th century. Modern Berkhamsted began to expand following the construction of the canal and the railway in the 19th century.  Among those born in Berkhamsted was Colonel [[Daniel Axtell]], who was the captain of the Parliamentary Guard at the trial and execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649. The towns literary connections include the 17th century hymnist and poet, [[William Cowper]], the 18th century writer [[Maria Edgeworth]], and the 20th century novelist [[Graham Greene]]. The town is the location of [[Berkhamsted School]], a co-educational boarding [[independent school]], founded in 1541 by [[John Incent]], [[Dean of St Paul's|Dean of St Paul's Cathedral]]; and [[Ashlyns School]] a state school whose history began as the [[Foundling Hospital]] established in London by [[Thomas Coram]], in 1742. The town is home to the [[The Rex, Berkhamsted|Rex Cinema]] (a highly regarded independent cinema) and the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[BFI National Archive]] at King's Hill, one of the largest film and television archives in the world, which was endowed by [[J. Paul Getty, Jr.]]{{sfn|Hastie|1999|p=60}}  ==History==  ===Origin of the town's name===  The earliest recorded spelling of the town's name is the 10th century [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Beorhðanstædæ''. The first part originates from the [[Old Celtic]] word ''Bearroc'', meaning "hilly place"; alternatively it may originate from the [[Old English]] words ''beorg'', meaning "hill", or ''berc'' or ''beorc'', meaning "[[birch]]". The latter part, "hamsted", derives from the Old English word for homestead, and thus the town can be understood as either the "homestead amongst the hills" or the "homestead among the birches".<ref name="David Mills">{{cite book|last=Mills | first=David |title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXucAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA53|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-019960908-6|page=53}}</ref><ref name="Caroline Taggart">{{cite book|author=Caroline Taggart|title=The Book of English Place Names: How Our Towns and Villages Got Their Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xNNERjxFr4C&pg=PA153|year=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978009194043-0|page=153}}</ref>  Local historian [[Percy Birtchnell]] identified over 50 different spellings and epithets for the town's name since the writing of the [[Domesday Book]]; the present spelling was adopted in 1937.<ref>{{cite web |last=Langston |first=Brett |url=http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/reg/districts/berkhampstead.html |title=Berkhampstead Registration District |publisher= GENUKI|accessdate=31 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Langston | first=Brett |url=http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/reg/districts/berkhamsted.html |title=Berkhamsted Registration District |publisher=GENUKI | accessdate=31 March 2015}}</ref> Other spellings included: "Berkstead", "Berkampsted", "Berkhampstead", "Muche Barkhamstede", "Berkhamsted Magna", "Great Berkhamsteed" and "Berkhamstead".<ref name=page1908>{{harvnb|Page|1908|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/victoriahis02page#page/162/mode/1up 162–179]}}</ref>{{sfn|Cobb|1883}} The town's local nickname is "Berko".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/threecounties/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8598000/8598429.stm |title=Joseph Millson talks about loving life in Berko|last= Herman | first=Judi |date=1 April 2010 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref>  ===Prehistoric and Roman===  [[File:WAW-C4A5F5.jpg|thumb|An Early Middle Bronze Age (c.1500 to 1300 BC) copper Chisel found in Berkhamsted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finds.org.uk:443/database/ajax/webcite/id/124479/type/artefacts |title=Finds record for: WAW-C4A5F5 |author=Bolton,A |accessdate=23 Oct 2015|publisher=The Portable Antiquities Scheme}}</ref>]][[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] and Roman artefacts show that the Berkhamsted area of the [[River Bulbourne|Bulbourne Valley]] has been settled for over 5,000 years.{{sfn|Hastie|1999|p=7}}{{sfn|Thompson|Bryant|2005|pp=2-5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkhamstedtowncouncil.gov.uk/uploads/e-history-etc-040204.pdf|title=Berkhamsted Official Guide 2004|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> The discovery of a large number of worked flint chips provides Neolithic evidence of on-site flint knapping in the centre of Berkhamsted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://reports.cotswoldarchaeology.co.uk/content/uploads/2015/03/660376-Berkhamsted-Police-Station-Eval-Report-15039.pdf |title=Berkhamsted Police Station Berkhamsted Hertfordshire Archaeological Evaluation |publisher=Cotswold Archaeology |date=January 2015 |accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref> Several settlements dating from the Neolithic to the Iron Age (about 4500–100&nbsp;BC) have been discovered south of Berkhamsted.

It was a hub of the country's inland water transport system, linking the ports and industrial centres of the country. Main activities included the transport of coal, grain, building materials and manure. Timber yards, boating wharves, breweries, boat building and chemical works flourished as a result of the canal, with over 700&nbsp;workers employed locally. It is still known as the "Port of Berkhamsted". Separately, [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]] (the "Canal Duke" and "father of the inland waterway system"), lived in Ashridge, near Berkhamsted. The canal became part of the [[Grand Union Canal]] in 1929. Once an important trade artery, today the Grand Union Canal, Canal Fields and river provide an open space, recreational opportunities, and a wildlife corridor running east–west through the centre of the town. [[File:Berkhamsted Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Berkhamsted's current railway station next to the Grand Union Canal.]]  ===Railway=== {{main|Berkhamsted railway station}}  The next stage in the town's transport history occurred in 1834 when, after opposition from [[turnpike trusts]] and local landowners was resolved, the first [[Berkhamsted railway station]] was built by chief engineer [[Robert Stephenson]]. Though the castle was the first building to receive statutory protection from Parliament, the railway embankment obliterated the old castle [[barbican]] and adjacent earthworks.

He campaigned for a hospital to accommodate them and was successfully granted a [[Royal Charter]] "for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Children" in 1739.
