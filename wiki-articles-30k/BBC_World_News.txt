   BBC World News is the BBC's international news and current affairs television channel. It has the largest audience of any BBC channel, with an estimated 76 million viewers weekly in 2014, part of the estimated 265 million users of the BBC's four main international news services.http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/global-news-audience-265m Launched on 11 March 1991 as BBC World Service Television outside Europe, its name was changed to BBC World on 16 January 1995 and to BBC World News on 21 April 2008. It broadcasts television programming including BBC News bulletins, documentaries, lifestyle programmes and interviews. It employs more correspondents and reporters and has more international bureaux than any other news channel. Unlike the BBC's domestic channels, BBC World News is owned and operated by BBC Global News Ltd., part of the BBC's commercial group of companies and is funded by subscription and advertising revenues, and not by the United Kingdom television licence. It is not owned by BBC Worldwide. The channel originally launched as BBC World Service Television, though unlike BBC World Service radio which (until 2011) was funded by a grant-in-aid from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the British government refused to extend the grant-in-aid to the new television service. It was launched on 11 March 1991, after two weeks of real-time pilots, initially as a half-hour bulletin once a day at 19:00 GMT. The programme editor was Johan "John" Ramsland from World Service Radio News with John Exelby from domestic BBC TV News as his managing editor. The original picture editing team consisted of Bob Scholes, Peter Hodge and Mike Casey. On Thursday, 26 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT, BBC World Service Television was split into 2-television stations: Since 1995, the service has gone through several branding changes. From 1995 to 1997, the channel used relatively few graphics to display the name of the channel, with the  studio modelled on that used for BBC News in the United Kingdom. As part of a major BBC corporate redesign (which included a new logo for the corporation on 4 October 1997) the channel received its first main refresh on 9 November 1997, the day BBC News 24 was launched. Various fictional flags with some real ones were used. The idents were computer generated and developed by the Lambie-Nairn design agency. Another large relaunch for BBC World took place on 3 April 2000,BBC World Unveils A New Look And A New Schedule | Scoop News which brought it in line with the BBC's UK news channel which was relaunched in 1999.  The new uniform look was made up of red and cream designed by Lambie-Nairn, with music based on a style described as 'drums and beeps' composed by David Lowe, a departure from the general orchestral versions of other news programmes. On 8 December 2003 a second makeover, using the same 'drums and beeps' style music but new graphics took place, although on a much smaller scale to that of 1999. The music was changed slightly while the main colour scheme became black and red, with studios using frosted glass, white and red colours. Later in 2004, the channel's slogan became Putting News First, replacing Demand a Broader View. The graphical refresh introduced in 2003 was refreshed in May 2006 with a more red output. On 22 January 2007 a new refresh was presented based on the previous graphics, a red coloured labels covering a red and black earthglobe along with the BBC World logo. The channel's present name was introduced on 21 April 2008 as part of a £550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output and visual identity. BBC World News later moved to the renovated former studio of BBC News 24 (now BBC News). New graphics were produced by the Lambie-Nairn design agency and music reworked by David Lowe. BBC World News relocated to Broadcasting House from its previous home at BBC Television Centre on 14 January 2013. This is a part of the move of BBC News and other audio and vision departments of the BBC into one building in Central London. Broadcasting House was refurbished at a cost of £1 billion with a new newsroom and several state-of-the-art news television studios being built. Live news output originates from studios B and C in Broadcasting House with some recorded programming from Broadcasting House studio A and the BBC Millbank studio. The BBC World News newsroom is now part of the new consolidated BBC Newsroom in Broadcasting House along with BBC World Service and UK domestic News services. Previously, the channel was broadcast in 4:3, with the news output fitted into a 14:9 frame for both digital and analogue broadcasting, resulting in black bands at the top and bottom of the screen. On 13 January 2009 at 09:57 GMT, BBC World News switched its broadcast to 16:9 format, initially in Europe on Astra 1L satellite, and Eutelsat Hot Bird 6 satellite to other broadcast feeds in the Asian region from 20 January 2009. As a result of the move to Broadcasting House, BBC World News gained high-definition studios and equipment to be able to broadcast in high-definition. On 5 August 2013, BBC World News will be offered as a High Definition (HD) feed across the Middle East when it launches its international HD channel on Arabsat. Arabsat will be the BBC's first distribution partner in the Middle East to offer the award-winning news channel in HD. On 1 April 2015 BBC World News in English started broadcasting in high definition from the 11.229&nbsp;GHz/V transponder on Astra 1KR at the 19.2°E orbital position, available free-to-air to viewers with 60&nbsp;cm dishes across Europe and coastal North Africa.BBC World News launches HD service in Europe BBC Media Centre. April 1, 2015.  Retrieved April 29, 2015 BBC World News claims to be watched by a weekly audience of 74 million in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. BBC World News is most commonly watched as a free-to-air (FTA) channel. The channel is available in Europe and many parts of the world via satellite (FTA) or cable platforms. In the United States, the channel is available through various providers such as Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, AT&T U-verse, DirecTV and others. This version is distributed through the BBC's partnership in the United States through AMC Networks, which owns the 'minority' half (49.9%) of partner channel BBC America, with some of the schedule carrying American advertising overlaid over the master BBC World News feed. In mid-2012, Livestation made BBC World News available as part of a subscription package with Sky International, Al Jazeera English, and EuroNews. As of 3 January 2013, the channel is not available in the United States via the website. Worldwide, the station is available free of charge and without geographical limitations through the free Readon Player software. There are usually at least two links to the feed. It can be found using the channel search feature or in the United Kingdom and News & Information sections. In Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, it is additionally available as a subscription mobile phone service, having also been available as a terrestrial channel. More recently, ad-supported mobile phone apps have been providing free access. TVGO Live TV provides a very clear and stable stream to Android devices; LiveTV also carries a stream but tends to suffer from stability issues in both the stream and the app itself. The channel is not officially available as a stand-alone, full-time channel in the United Kingdom because it carries and is funded by advertising (BBC's domestic channels are funded by a television licence fee which households and establishments that want to watch television programmes as they are being broadcast must pay), although it can be easily received due to its 'free-to-air' status on many European satellite systems, including Astra and Hot Bird and is available in selected London hotels.  BBC World News can also be viewed in the public areas of Broadcasting House (the lobby and cafe). However, some BBC World News programmes are available to UK audiences. There is a simulcast of the 05:00 UK edition of BBC World News on BBC One and the BBC News channel, followed by an edition of World Business Report. This programme was previously branded as ''''The World Today''''.  While international audiences see advertisements during the break, UK viewers see domestic headlines.  This simulcast is in addition to overnight simulcasts of the top of the hour from 00.00 to 05.00 UK time on both BBC World News and BBC News channel and are simply branded as ''BBC News'' (except for Newsday which simulcasts 00.00 UK time weekdays), even if they are produced by BBC World News. The 11:30 UK edition of ''[[BBC World News (TV series)|BBC World News]]'' is shown on [[BBC Two]] Mon-Fri but not on Wednesdays when Parliament is sitting and there is Prime Minister's Questions.  This forms '''BBC News at 11''' on BBC Two, which is made up of half an hour of BBC News and then half an hour of BBC World News. This can also happen during big news events and the News Channel presenter will join the BBC World News presenter in Studio C as it used by both channels. This was done for example for coverage of events such as the Glasgow Helicopter Crash, Election of Pope Francis and Boston Marathon Bombings. Previously ''[[GMT (programme)|GMT]]'' was shown at 12:30 on the channel.  BBC World News also produces a version of ''[[World News Today]]'' at 19:00 weekdays and 21:00 weekends UK time. The first half-hour of this programme can be seen in the UK on [[BBC Four]]. The edition of the programme replaced ''The World'', which had been broadcast as a simulcast on the channel between 2002 and 2007.  Both World and the BBC News channel have also occasionally had to simulcast the same news program due to strike action or technical issues; this occurred in 2003 when Television Centre in London was affected by electrical problems.  ==Programming== Live news programmes: *''[[BBC World News (TV series)|BBC World News]]'' – The latest international news as it breaks. *''[[Newsday (TV series)|Newsday]]'' – Live international news from London and Singapore every weekday.

On PBS stations, ''BBC World News'' does not appear with commercials (the breaks are replaced with news stories) but omits the [[Met Office]] international [[Weather forecasting|weather forecast]] at the end, replacing it with underwriting announcements. The PBS airings are [[Broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] on some stations.  BBC America airs a 3-hour block of BBC World News coverage from 05:00 to 08:00 on weekdays. Met Office forecasts are removed, and is broadcast with advertisements. Another BBC World News programme, the hour-long ''[[BBC World News America]]'', aired on BBC America at 19:00 [[Eastern Time]]. A second broadcast at 22:00 Eastern Time ended in 2010 when BBC America introduced a second feed for the western time zones of the US on 18 February 2011, it was announced that ''BBC World News America'' would be discontinued on BBC America and would instead be airing only on BBC World and local [[PBS]] stations in the United States as a 30-minute program.<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/content/bbc-world-news-america-shifts-bbc-world-news 'BBC World News America' Shifts To BBC World News] Multichannel News, 18 February 2011</ref>  ''BBC World News'' bulletins also appear on [[Hong Kong]] [[TVB Pearl|TVB English Channel]] instead of: ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' [[simulcast]]ing on [[NBC News]] by [[WNBC-TV|WNBC-4]] from 07:30 until 08:00 [[Hong Kong Time]] (18:30 until 19:00 [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]), [[CCTV News|CCTV English News Live]] [[simulcast]]ing on [[CCTV News]] from 12:00 until 13:00 [[Beijing Time|Beijing]]/[[Hong Kong Time]] and [[News at 7:30]] from 19:30 until 20:00 [[Hong Kong Time]].

However, there are some regional programming variations. For example, a number of programmes are made exclusively for regional viewings, such as Indian feeds, and ''The Record Europe'', which is only broadcast in Europe.  On most feeds of BBC World News, when there are no commercials being inserted by the cable or satellite provider similar to other channels, the break filler shows promotions for upcoming programmes on the channel. During BBC News, a news story that has not been promoted airs during what would be the [[commercial break]]. This is the case on the broadband versions of BBC World News, and on versions of BBC World News aired in the United States on [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) stations. However, there are some global commercials and sponsorships which air throughout the network.  On 11 September 2007, the break filler was redesigned and now more closely resembles previous versions{{clarify|date=February 2015}}. The promotional videos now fill the entire screen and are interspersed with news and market updates, schedules, and other information. There is also no longer a unifying music composition. Instead, each 20-second promotional video uses music selected from a handful of themes, which have some unifying musical characteristics. The information screens, such as the 10-second plug for the website or YouTube channel, and the 15-second weather/time/coming up screens each feature their own theme. The colour theme was updated following the relaunch of the channel in April 2008.  Since its inception, and more so since its extensive association with the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News channel]], the countdown to the hourly news bulletin has been a feature of the channel's presentation, accompanied by music composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]]. The current style of countdown features reporters and technical staff in many different locations working to bring news stories to air.  ==Awards== BBC World News was named ''Best International News Channel'' at the [[Association for International Broadcasting]] Awards in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world_radio_and_tv/ |title=Key Dates |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |publisher=BBC World News}}</ref> It won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2007 for ''White Horse Village"<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/white-horse-village 67th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2008.</ref> and another in 2009 for "Where Giving Life is a Death Sentence."<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/where-giving-life-is-a-death-sentence 69th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2010.</ref>''  ==Other stations== {{div col|2|colwidth=30em}} *[[Al Jazeera English]] *[[Bloomberg Television]] *[[CNBC]] *[[CBC News]] *[[CNN International]] *[[CCTV-News]] *[[Channel NewsAsia]] *[[Deutsche Welle]] *[[Euronews]] *[[Le Canal Nouvelles]] *[[France 24]] *[[Globo News]] *[[Band News]] *[[i24news]] *[[Japan News Network]] *[[NHK World]] *[[RTÉ News Now]] *[[Russia Today TV|RT]] *[[Press TV]] *[[Sky News]] {{div col end}}  ==References== {{Reflist|30em}} {{Portal|BBC}}  ==External links== *{{Official website|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world_radio_and_tv/}} *[http://www.asialive.tv/bbc-world-news/ Watch BBC World TV Live ]  {{BBC News}} {{Navboxes |list1= {{BBC Television}} {{BBC World Service}} {{International news channels}} {{Television in Greece}} }} {{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Bbc World News}} [[Category:BBC World News]] [[Category:BBC News channels]] [[Category:International BBC television channels]] [[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1991]] [[Category:Television channels in the Netherlands]] [[Category:Television channels in Belgium]] [[Category:Television channels in Flanders]] [[Category:Multilingual news services]] [[Category:24-hour television news channels in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:1991 establishments in the United Kingdom]] Monday, 16 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT: 24-hour 24-hour English free-to-air terrestrial international news channel such: news bulletin, information, business and financial, news magazine and current affairs programmes led of "BBC World" (now BBC World News).
