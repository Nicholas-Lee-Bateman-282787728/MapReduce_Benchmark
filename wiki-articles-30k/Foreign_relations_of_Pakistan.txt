   Pakistan is the second largest Muslim country in terms of population (after Indonesiahttp://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/21/by-2050-india-to-have-worlds-largest-populations-of-hindus-and-muslims/) and its status as a declared nuclear power, being the only Islamic nation to have that status, plays a part in its international role. Pakistan has a fiercely independent foreign policy, especially when it comes to issues such as development of nuclear weapons, construction of nuclear reactors, foreign military purchases and other issues that are vital to its national interests. Pakistan has a strategic geo-political location at the corridor of world major maritime oil supply lines, and has close proximity to the resource and oil rich central Asian countries. Pakistan is an important member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), is ranked by the US as a major non-NATO ally in the war against terrorism, and has a highly disciplined and professional military. The foreign policy of Pakistan sets out in the way it interacts with foreign nations and to determine its standard of interactions for its organizations, corporations and individual citizens.  Backed by the semi-agricultural and semi-industrialized economy, Pakistan is the 45th largest (nominal GDP) and 25th largest (purchasing power) economic power in the world, with a defence budget of $6.98 billion, which accounts for approximately ~0.37% of global military spending. The Foreign Minister of Pakistan is the official charged with state-to-state diplomacy, although the Prime minister maintains an ultimate authority over foreign policy. The state foreign policy includes defining the national interest, as well as the economic interest and strategies chosen both to safeguard that and to achieve its policy goals. Following the general election held on May 2013, Tariq Fatimi and NSA Sartaj Aziz are designated as advisers to the Prime Minister on foreign and strategic policies. Since its independence in 1947, Pakistan's foreign policy has encompassed difficult relations with the neighboring Soviet Union (USSR) who maintained a close military and ideological interaction with the neighboring countries such as Afghanistan (in the West) and India (in East) as well as East Pakistan.  During most of 1947–1991, the USSR support was given to India; especially on the core-issue of Kashmir, over which it has fought three wars. During the 1960s, Pakistan's relations with East Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan have also been extremely difficult due to the latter's contest over the Durand Line. The foreign relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia and China remains extremely important and based on the extensive cooperation in national security and economical interests in the Persian Gulf and wide-ranging bilateral relations with the United States and other Western countries. With the growing influence of USSR in the region, Pakistan cemented close security relations with China in Asia and Poland in Europe during most of the Cold War. While Pakistan's had "on-off relations" with the United States, Pakistan assisted President Nixon reapproach with China and other East Asian countries. In 1947, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of the state of Pakistan, clearly described the principles and objectives of Pakistan's foreign policy in a broadcast message, which is featured prominently in a quotation on the homepage of Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website: "The foundation of our foreign policy is friendship with all nations across the globe."   In 1951, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan paid a historical and friendly state visit to the United States, and held meetings with President Harry Truman and the American military officials for the purpose of the military aid. Ideologically, Prime Minister Ali Khan was opposed to the communism; his government was also struggling with the issues concerning the matters of uplifting the national economy and protecting interests of national security. In 1954–56, the United States and Pakistan signed the  Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement which saw the dispatching of the Military Assistance Advisory Group to provide military training to the Pakistan Armed Forces in 1955–56. In 1955, Pakistan joined the CENTO and the SEATO alliances in 1956. In 1971, Pakistan withdrew itself from these two alliances in a vision of exercising the independent foreign policy. In 1974, Pakistan became a critical entity in the militarization of the OIC and has  historically maintained brotherly and friendly relations with all the Arab and Muslim countries under the banner of OIC. In 2004, Pakistan became the Major non-NATO ally of the United States.  Since 1947, Pakistan's relations have been difficult with regional neighbors, India and Afghanistan over the geopolitical issues. In fact, India and Pakistan have fought three conventional wars throughout the 20th century over the issue of Kashmir. The continuing dispute over the status of Kashmir inflames opinions in both nations and makes friendly relations difficult. In the 1960s, the problems over the Durand Line escalated with Afghanistan which led to open hostilities in the 1970s.  Pakistan is an active member of the United Nations. It was a member of the CENTO and SEATO military alliances. Its alliance with the United States was especially close after the Soviets invaded the neighboring country of Afghanistan. In 1964, Pakistan signed the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) Pact with Turkey and Iran, when all three countries were closely allied with the U.S., and as neighbors of the Soviet Union, wary of perceived Soviet expansionism. To this day, Pakistan has a close relationship with Turkey. RCD became defunct after the Iranian Revolution, and a Pakistani-Turkish initiative led to the founding of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in 1985. Pakistan is the leading member of the Coffee Club to oppose Indian membership in the United Nations Security Council.  Pakistan was a member of the Commonwealth from 1947 to 1956 under the name 'Dominion of Pakistan'. From 1956 to 1972,the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was a Commonwealth republic, when it was withdrawn in protest at the Commonwealth's support of East Pakistan's secession and Bangladesh's independence. In 1989, Pakistan regained its status as a Commonwealth republic, which remains the case, despite Pakistan's suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations between 1999 and 2008.            Country Formal relations began Notes 1971 Islamabad and Manama enjoy close co-operations between the two in many fields of brotherhood.  Joint initiatives between Bahraini and Pakistani governments have started to further bilateral trades that reached to $250 million in 2007.  Pakistan Army also maintains an Infantry Battalion and a Squadron of Tanks in Bahrain 14/Aug/1947 Teheran and Islamabad have a somewhat simple relationship.  Although both the countries have been at odds at some issues including border clashes and supported rival entities during the Afghan civil war, there is a general consensus within both the countries to develop close and steady relations over the span of time.  Pakistan has an embassy in Iran's capital Teheran and consulates-general in Mashhad and Zahidan. Iran has an embassy in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, supported by many consulates-general and cultural centers in many major cities including Karachi, Lahore, Quetta, Peshawar, Rawalpindi and Multan. Iraq and Pakistan have had close, friendly, and cooperative relations since the latter's independence in 1947.  Issues such as Iraqi support for Pakistan in its 1971 war with India (which Iraq also has excellent relations with), and Pakistani support for Iraq against Iran in the Iran-Iraq War have forged relations between the two. No formal diplomatic relations There are very close relations between Jordan and Pakistan.  Princess Sarvath wife of Prince Hassan is originally a Pakistani. At the international level Pakistan and Jordan have similar views such as the Israel/Palestine issue. After the end of the first Gulf War in 1991 Pakistani army engineers were involved in a programme of mine clearance in the country.[ ]  Kuwait was also the first country to send aid to isolated mountain villages in Kashmir after the quake of 2005,[ ]  also offering the largest amount of aid in the aftermath of the quake ($100m). Lebanon and Pakistan have good relations.  Pakistan has also been a steadfast supporter of Lebanon particularly when it was invaded by Israel.   Additionally, Pakistan has extended moral, diplomatic and material support to Lebanon and refuses to recognize Israel officially, as a legitimate country in solidarity with the Palestinian, Lebanese and other Middle Eastern countries. The relationship between Muscat and Islamabad is warm, because it is the nearest Arab country to Pakistan and the fact that some 30% of Omani's are of Balochi origin from Pakistan's Balochistan province having settled Oman over a hundred years ago.  In 1958 Gwadar was part of Oman but was transferred to Pakistan in that year.  Pakistan recognized independence of Azerbaijan 1991 (the second country after Turkey) and the two countries established full diplomatic relations in 1992. Pakistan was one of the first countries to open its Embassy in Baku. Pakistan fully supports the proposal of the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Due to Pakistan's pro-Palestinian stance, bilateral relations between Pakistan and Israel have continuously wavered over the last few years. Pakistan has also declined to recognise the state of Israel until the "liberation of Palestine" will take place. Saudi Arabia has also provided extensive religious and educational aid to Pakistan.  Saudi Arabia remains a major destination for immigration amongst Pakistanis, the number of whom living in Saudi Arabia stands between 900,000 and 1 million.  Saudi Arabia is the largest source of petroleum for Pakistan. It also supplies extensive financial aid to Pakistan and remittance from Pakistani migrants to Saudi Arabia is also a major source of foreign currency. Both countries were on the silk route through which civilizational exchanges took place for centuries, Islamic missionaries that introduced Islam after 711 AD were from Syria.  During the Yom Kippur War of 1973 (usually referred to as the Ramadan war in Pakistan) several Pakistani pilots assisted the Syrian air force. In 2005 Syria and Pakistan agreed on mutual cooperation in the fields of science and technology.[ ]  Pakistan was the first country to accord formal recognition to UAE on its achieving independence.  Bilateral relations and mutually beneficial cooperation have progressed steadily ever since.  These relations date back to the UAE's formation in 1971, and have since evolved into wide-ranging co-operation in various fields. UAE has been a major donor of economic assistance to Pakistan. 18/Jan/1976 Relations between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh are influenced by the fact that Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan until 1971, when it achieved independence after the Bangladesh Liberation War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. As part of Shimla Agreement, India sought to make sure that Pakistan would take steps to recognize Bangladesh. Pakistan established full diplomatic relations with Bangladesh on January 18, 1976, and relations improved in the following decades. However, since Bangladesh is one of the most anti Pakistani countries relations have been strained now. Pakistan is one of the few countries with which Bhutan maintains diplomatic relationship.  Both countries are member of SAARC. Trade and bilateral relationship between the two countries can be largely regarded as being insignificant, and the diplomatic relationship as being largely symbolic. Diplomatic relationship between Pakistan and Brunei are very warm and friendly, this is primarily because both are Muslim countries and member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.  Pakistan maintains an High commission in Brunei,HIGH COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN IN BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, BRUNEI and Brunei has an embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan.

PRC 1951 Diplomatic relations between Pakistan and the People's Republic of China (PRC) were established on 21 May 1951, shortly after the retreat of the Republic Of China in 1949.Pakistan and China Relations While initially ambivalent towards the idea of a Communist country on its borders, Pakistan hoped that the PRC would serve as a counterweight to Indian influence. India had recognised the PRC a year before, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru also hoped for closer relations between India and the PRC. However, with escalating border tensions leading to the 1962 Sino-Indian war, the PRC and Pakistan formed an alliance. One year after the PRCs border war with India, Pakistan ceded the Trans-Karakoram Tract to the PRC in order to convince the PRC Authorities to be friendly towards Pakistan. Relations between India and Pakistan have been strained by a number of historical and political issues, and are defined by the violent partition of British India in 1947, the Kashmir dispute and the numerous military conflicts fought between the two nations. Consequently, even though the two South Asian nations share historic, cultural, geographic, and economic links, their relationship has been plagued by hostility and suspicion. India and Pakistan have fought in numerous armed conflicts since their independence. There are three major wars that have taken place between the two states, namely in 1947, 1965 and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. In addition to this was the unofficial Kargil War and some border skirmishes.
