    The National University of Ireland, Maynooth (), commonly known as Maynooth University, is a constituent university of the National University of Ireland in Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland. It is Ireland's youngest university, having been founded by the Universities Act, 1997 from the secular faculties of the now separate St Patrick's College, Maynooth, which was founded in 1795.NUI Maynooth> About NUI Maynooth > History The university consists of two connected campuses; an older south campus with 19th century buildings, shared with St Patrick's College, and a modern north campus, occupying circa . With around 8,800 registered students, it is Ireland's smallest, yet fastest growing university.M195   In 2009, NUI Maynooth was listed as a Top500 university in the Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings.Top Universities  The 2012 QS World University Rankings puts NUIM in the 501-550 bracket worldwide. In 2008 it was named Sunday Times University of the Year. In 2011, NUI Maynooth became the first and only institution outside of North America to be included in the Princeton Review of Best Colleges.  The university and St Patrick's College, Maynooth have a common history from 1795 to 1997. The college in Maynooth was established by the government as a college for Catholic lay and ecclesiastical students in 1795, archives of which can be found hereMaynooth College History www.maynoothcollege.ie Official St Patrick's College website the lay college was based from 1802 in Riverstown House on the south campus, with the opening of Clongowes Wood, the lay college which had lay trustees was closed in 1817Lay Catholics Educated at Maynooth College. (Hansard, 27 March 1908) Lay Catholics Educated at Maynooth College (Hansard, 1908) and it functioned solely as a Catholic seminary for almost 150 years. In 1876 the college became a constituent college of the Catholic University of Ireland, and later offered Royal University of Ireland degrees in arts and science. The Pontifical Charter was granted to the college in 1896. The college became a recognised constituent college of the National University of Ireland in 1910. From this time, arts and science degrees were awarded by the National University of Ireland, while the Pontifical University of Maynooth continued to confer its own theology degrees, as these had been prohibited in the Royal University of Ireland, and continued to the National University of Ireland (its successor) until 1997. In 1966 the college allowed again the entry of lay students; this greatly expanded the college and essentially set the foundation stone for the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. In 1997 the Universities Act resulted in the transfer of the faculties of arts, Celtic studies, philosophy and science of the recognised college of St Patrick's College to the new university. The university has also expanded into finance and engineering since its creation in 1997. In 2007 the university added business studies, followed by law in 2008. Any person who was a student at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, and was conferred with a National University of Ireland degree prior to the creation of the university is legally considered a graduate of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.Universities Act, 1997 Section 48   In 1994, W. J. Smyth was appointed to the position of Master of St. Patrick's College Maynooth (NUI). In 1997 this position became President of NUIM. In 2004 W. J. Smyth was succeeded by John Hughes as president of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. On 2 December 2011, eight students from NUIM, including the university's student union president Rob Munnelly, began occupying the Naas constituency office of Fine Gael TD Anthony Lawlor amid concerns about increased tuition fees. They did so with sleeping bags, clothes, a chemical toilet and a week's supply of food and were supported by other students on Facebook and Twitter. During the occupation Munnelly debated with Lawlor live on Kildare TV, USI President Gary Redmond visited the revolting students and a banner with the slogan "SAVE THE GRANT" was erected at Lawlor's entrance. The university campus straddles the main Maynooth to Kilcock Road in County Kildare. It is divided into the North Campus and the South Campus (also referred to by staff and students as the "new" and "old" campuses respectively). The campuses were connected by means of a footbridge that crossed over the road until mid-2011. The footbridge was then decommissioned due to the construction of a library extension on the South Campus. The campuses are now connected by means of a pedestrian crossing on the Kilcock Road. The South Campus houses the facilities of St. Patrick's College, as well as most of administrative offices it shares with NUIM. A number of NUIM academic departments also have their offices on the South Campus including mathematics, music, geography, economics and history. The main buildings, most of which were built in the 19th century, are the Aula Maxima; St. Patrick's House (including the college chapel); the John Paul II Library (built in 1984); New, Dunboyne, Humanity and Stoyte Houses which collectively form St. Joseph's Square; Logic House and Rhetoric House. The first building to be completed on the South Campus was named after its designer, John Stoyte. Stoyte House, still a prominent presence on campus, stands in proximity to Maynooth Castle.. Over the next 15 years, the site at Maynooth underwent rapid construction so as to cater for the influx of new students, and the buildings which now border St. Joseph's Square (to the rear of Stoyte House) were completed by 1824. The university chapel is located on the South Campus, just off St. Joseph's Square; masses and choir services are frequently held in the chapel, as is the traditional Christmas carol service. The South Campus also houses the National Science Museum.Science Museum, Maynooth  The North Campus was developed far more recently than the South Campus, in the latter half of the 20th century. Here, the main buildings are the Students' Union, Sports Complex, Biosciences and Engineering Building, Callan Science Building (named after the inventor of the induction coil, Nicholas Callan), the Iontas building, the Arts Building, the Science Building and the John Hume Building. The new ICT Hub is currently under construction and is set to house the department of Computer Science, the Business Incubation Centre and  IVI, Hamilton and Callan Institutes with several teaching spaces.ICT Hub Maynooth The North Campus also contains the student residences, most of the student service departments, a number of playing fields and a sports complex, which includes a fully equipped gym, that is free to all university students.
