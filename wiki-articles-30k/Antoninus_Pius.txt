He was one of the Five Good Emperors in the Nerva–Antonine dynasty and the Aurelii.Bowman, pg. 150 He acquired the name Pius after his accession to the throne, either because he compelled the Senate to deify his adoptive father Hadrian,Birley, pg. 54; Dio, 70:1:2 or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.Birley, pg. 55, citing the Historia Augusta, Life of Hadrian 24.4 He was born as the only child of Titus Aurelius Fulvus, consul in 89Bowman, pg. 150 whose family came from Nemausus (modern Nîmes).Bury, pg. 523 Titus Aurelius Fulvius was the son of a senator of the same name, who, as legate of Legio III Gallica, had supported Vespasian in his bid to the Imperial office and been rewarded with a suffect consulship, plus an ordinary one under Domitian in 85. The Aurelii Fulvii were therefore a relatively new senatorial family from Gallia Narbonensis whose rise to prominence was supported by the Flavians.Hugo Thomas Dupuis Whitfield, "THE RISE OF NEMAUSUS FROM AUGUSTUS TO ANTONINUS PIUS: A PROSOPOGRAPHICAL STUDY OF NEMAUSIAN SENATORS AND EQUESTRIANS".M.A. Thesis, Queen's University, Ontario, 2012, pages 49/57.

The Arrii Antoninii were an older senatorial family from Italy, very influential during Nerva's reign.Arria Fadilla, Antoninus'mother, married afterwards Publius Julius Lupus, a man of consular rank, suffect consul in 98, and two daughters, Arria Lupula and Julia Fadilla, were born from that union.Birley, pg. 242; Historia Augusta, Life of Antoninus Pius 1:6 Some time between 110 and 115, Antoninus married Annia Galeria Faustina the Elder.

By this scheme, Verus, who was already Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his natural father, remained Hadrian's adoptive son through his new father.  The adoption of Marcus Aurelius was probably a suggestion of Antoninus himself, since the former was the nephew of the latter's wife and would be his favorite son.     On his accession, Antoninus' name became "Imperator Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pontifex Maximus". One of his first acts as Emperor was to persuade the Senate to grant divine honours to Hadrian, which they had at first refused;Bowman, pg. 151 his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is the most likely reason given for his title of Pius (dutiful in affection; compare pietas).Birley, pg. 55; Canduci, pg. 39  Two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged father-in-law with his hand at Senate meetings, and that he had saved those men that Hadrian, during his period of ill-health, had condemned to death.Bury,pg. 523 Immediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus' betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead.

This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations.See Victor, 15:3 Antoninus was regarded as a skilled administrator and as a builder. In spite of an extensive building directive - the free access of the people of Rome to drinking water was expanded with the construction of aqueducts, not only in Rome but throughout the Empire, as well as bridges and roads -, the Emperor still managed to leave behind a sizable public treasure, of around two and a half million sesterzi. The Emperor also famously suspended the collection of taxes from cities affected by natural disasters, such as when fires struck Rome and Narbona, and earthquakes affected Rhodes and the Province of Asia. He offered hefty financial grants for rebuilding and recovery of various Greek cities after two serious earthquakes: the first, circa 140, which affected mostly Rhodes and other islands; the second, in 152, which hit Cyzicus - where the huge and newly built Temple to Hadrian was destroyedBarbara Burrell.

Antoninus tried to portray himself as a magistrate of the res publica, no matter how extended and ill-defined his competences were: therefore the fact that he is credited with the splitting of the imperial treasure, the Fiscus. This splitting had to do with the division of Imperial properties into two parts: firstly, the fiscus itself-or patrimonium, meaning the properties of the "Crown", the hereditary properties of each succeeding person that sat on the throne, transmitted to his successors in office,Oxford Classical Dictionary, London: 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-954556-8, entry "Patrimonium". regardless of their being members of the imperial family or not;After the death of Nero, the personal properties of the Julio-Claudian dynasty had been appropriated by the Flavians, and therefore turned into public properties: Carrié & Roussele, 586 secondly, the res privata, the "private" properties tied to the personal maintenance of the Emperor and his family.Carrié & Rousselle, 586 An anecdote in the Historia Augusta biography, where Antoninus replies to Faustina - who complained about his stingness - that "we have gained an empire [and] lost even what we had before" possibly relates to Antoninus' actual concerns at the creation of the res privata.The Cambridge Ancient History, XI: The High Empire, AD 70-192.

However, Antoninus did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire.Bury, pg. 526 One of his chief concerns was to having local communities conform their legal procedures to existing Roman norms: in a case concerning repression of banditry by local police officers ("irenarchs") in Asia Minor, Antoninus ordered that these officers should not treat suspects as already condemned, and also keep a detailed copy of their interrogations,to be used in the possibility of an appeal to the Roman governor.Clifford Ando, Imperial Rome AD 193 to 284: The Critical Century. Edinburgh University Press, 2012,ISBN 978-0-7486-2050-0,page 91 Also, although Antoninus was not an innovator, he would not always follow the absolute letter of the law; rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality, and introduced into Roman law many important new principles based upon this notion.Bury, pg. 526 In this, the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers: L.

He mitigated the use of torture in examining slaves by certain limitations. Thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years, though this rule had exceptions.Bury, pg. 527 However, it must be stressed that Antoninus extended, by means of a rescript, the use of torture as a means of obtaining evidence to pecuniary cases, when it had been applied up until then only in criminal cases.Digest , 48.18.9, as quoted by Edward Peters, Torture, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996, ISBN 0-8122-1599-0 , page  29 Also, already at the time torture of free men of low status (humiliores) had become legal, as proved by the fact that Antoninus exempted town councillors expressly from it, and also free men of high rank (honestiores) in general.Grant, 154/155.

While this increased Antoninus’s popularity, the frugal emperor had to debase the Roman currency.

However, it seems that this was not the case: according to his Historia Augusta biography (which seems to reproduce an earlier, detailed report)  Antoninus' body (and not his ashes) was buried in Hadrian's mausoleum. After a seven-day interval (justitium) Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification.Robert Turcan, "Origines et sens de l'inhumation à l'époque impériale". In: Revue des Études Anciennes. Tome 60, 1958, n°3-4. pp. 323-347. Available at [ ]. Accessed January 14, 2016 In contrast to their behavior during Antoninus' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A flamen, or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Antoninus, now Divus Antoninus. A column was dedicated to Antoninus on the Campus Martius, and the temple he had built in the Forum in 141 to his deified wife Faustina was rededicated to the deified Faustina and the deified Antoninus.Bury, pg. 532 It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 118.   The only account of his life handed down to us is that of the Augustan History, an unreliable and mostly fabricated work. Nevertheless, it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound – for instance, it is the only source that mentions the erection of the Antonine Wall in Britain.Historia Augusta, Life of Antoninus Pius 5:4  Antoninus is unique among Roman emperors in that he has no other biographies. Historians have therefore turned to public records for what details we know. Antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans, but also by later scholars of classical history, such as Edward Gibbon or the author of the article on Antoninus Pius in the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica:  Later historians had a more nuanced view of his reign. According to the historian J. B. Bury,  Inevitably, the surviving evidence is not complete enough to determine whether one should interpret, with older scholars, that he wisely curtailed the activities of the Roman Empire to a careful minimum, or perhaps that he was uninterested in events away from Rome and Italy and his inaction contributed to the pressing troubles that faced not only Marcus Aurelius but also the emperors of the third century.  German historian Ernst Kornemann has had it in his Römische Geschichte [2 vols., ed. by H. Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954] that the reign of Antoninus comprised "a succession of grossly wasted opportunities," given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' passing.  Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders. Although only one of his four children survived to adulthood, Antoninus came to be ancestor to generations of prominent Roman statesmen and socialites, including at least one empress consort and as the maternal grandfather of the Emperor Commodus.  The family of Antoninus Pius and Faustina the Elder also represents one of the few periods in ancient Roman history where the position of Emperor passed smoothly from father to son.  Direct descendants of Antoninus and Faustina were confirmed to exist at least into the fifth century AD. 1. Marcus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus (died before 138), died young without issue 2.
