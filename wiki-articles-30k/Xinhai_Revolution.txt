     The Xinhai Revolution (or the Hsin-hai Revolution), also known as the Revolution of 1911, or the Chinese Revolution, was a revolution that overthrew China's last imperial dynasty (the Qing dynasty), and established the Republic of China (ROC). The revolution was named Xinhai (Hsin-hai) because it occurred in 1911, the year of the Xinhai (辛亥) stem-branch in the sexagenary cycle of the Chinese calendar.Li Xing. [2010] (2010). The Rise of China and the Capitalist World Order. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. ISBN 0-7546-7913-6, ISBN 978-0-7546-7913-4. pg 91. The revolution consisted of many revolts and uprisings. The turning point was the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, that was a result of the mishandling of the Railway Protection Movement. The revolution ended with the abdication of the six-year-old "Last Emperor", Puyi, on February 12, 1912, that marked the end of 2,000 years of imperial rule and the beginning of China's early republican era (1912–16).Li, Xiaobing. [2007] (2007). A History of the Modern Chinese Army. University Press of Kentucky. ISBN 0-8131-2438-7, ISBN 978-0-8131-2438-4. pg 13. pg 26–27. The revolution arose mainly in response to the decline of the Qing state, which had proven ineffective in its efforts to modernize China and confront foreign aggression, and was exacerbated by ethnic resentment against the ruling Manchu minority. Many underground anti-Qing groups, with the support of Chinese revolutionaries in exile, tried to overthrow the Qing. The brief civil war that ensued was ended through a political compromise between Yuan Shikai, the late Qing military strongman, and  Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Tongmenghui (United League). After the Qing court transferred power to the newly founded republic, a provisional coalition government was created along with the National Assembly. However, political power of the new national government in Beijing was soon thereafter monopolized by Yuan and led to decades of political division and warlordism, including several attempts at imperial restoration. The Republic of China in Taiwan and the People's Republic of China on the mainland consider themselves the legitimate successors to the Xinhai Revolution and revere the ideals of the revolution including nationalism, republicanism, modernization of China and national unity. October 10 is commemorated in Taiwan as Double Ten Day, the National Day of the ROC. In mainland China,  the same day is usually celebrated as the Anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution.雙十節是？ 陸民眾：「國民黨」國慶. Tvbs.com.tw. Retrieved on October 8, 2011. Many overseas Chinese also celebrate the anniversary in Chinatowns across the world.   After suffering its first defeat to the West in the First Opium War in 1842, the Qing court struggled to contain foreign intrusions into China. Efforts to adjust and reform the traditional methods of governance were constrained by a deeply conservative court culture where ethnic Manchu rulers did not want to give too much authority to the Han Chinese majority. In the wars against the Taiping (1851–64), Nian (1851–68), Muslims of Yunnan (1856–68) and the Northwest (1862–77), the traditional Manchu armies proved themselves incompetent, and the court came to rely on local Han armies.Wang, Ke-wen. [1998] (1998). Modern China: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Nationalism. Taylor & Francis publishing. ISBN 0-8153-0720-9, ISBN 978-0-8153-0720-4. pg 106. pg 344. Following defeat in the Second Opium War, the Qing tried to modernize by adopting certain Western technologies through the Self-Strengthening Movement from 1861.Wang, Gabe T. [2006] (2006). China and the Taiwan Issue: Impending War at Taiwan Strait. University Press of America. ISBN 0-7618-3434-6, ISBN 978-0-7618-3434-2. pg 91. In 1895, China suffered a serious defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War.Bevir, Mark. [2010] (2010). Encyclopedia of Political Theory. Sage Publishing. ISBN 1-4129-5865-2, ISBN 978-1-4129-5865-3. pg 168. This demonstrated that traditional Chinese feudal society also needed to be modernized if the technological and commercial advancements were to succeed. In 1898, the Guangxu Emperor was guided by reformers like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao for a drastic reform in education, military and economy under the Hundred Days' Reform. The reform was a failure, as it was ended prematurely by a conservative coup led by Empress Dowager Cixi.Chang, Kang-i Sun, Owen, Stephen (2010). The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature, Volume 2. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-11677-5, ISBN 978-0-521-11677-0. pg 441. The Guangxu Emperor, who had always been a puppet emperor dependent on Cixi, was put under house arrest in June 1898. Reformers Kang and Liang would be exiled. While in Canada, in June 1899, they tried to form the Emperor Protection Society in an attempt to restore the emperor. Empress Dowager Cixi mainly controlled the Qing dynasty from this point on. The Boxer Rebellion prompted another foreign invasion of Beijing in 1900 and the imposition of unequal treaty terms, which carved away territories, created extraterritorial concessions and gave away trade privileges. Under internal and external pressure, the Qing court began to adopt some of the reforms. The Qing managed to maintain its monopoly on political power by suppressing, often with great brutality, all domestic rebellions. Dissidents could operate only in secret societies and underground organizations, in foreign concessions or in exile overseas. There were many revolutionaries and groups that wanted to overthrow the Qing government to re-establish a Han Chinese government. The earliest revolutionary organizations were founded outside of China, such as Yeung Ku-wan's Furen Literary Society, created in Hong Kong in 1890. There were fifteen members, including Tse Tsan-tai, who did political satire such as "The Situation in the Far East", one of the first ever Chinese manhua, and who later became one of the core founders of the South China Morning Post.South China morning post. March 29, 2011. Hong Kong played a key role in the life of Sun Yat-sen. Sun Yat-sen's Xingzhonghui (Revive China Society) was established in Honolulu in 1894 with the main purpose of raising funds for revolutions.Lum, Yansheng Ma. Lum, Raymond Mun Kong. [1999] (1999).

The Huaxinghui (China Revival Society) was founded in 1904 with notables like Huang Xing, Zhang Shizhao, Chen Tianhua and Song Jiaoren, along with 100 others. Their motto was "Take one province by force, and inspire the other provinces to rise up".Platt, Stephen R. [2007] (2007). Provincial Patriots: The Hunanese and Modern China. Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-02665-9, ISBN 978-0-674-02665-0. pg 128. The Guangfuhui (Restoration Society) was also founded in 1904, in Shanghai with Cai Yuanpei. Other notable members include Zhang Binglin and Tao Chengzhang.Goossaert, Vincent. Palmer, David A. [2011] (2011). The Religious Question in Modern China. University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0-226-30416-7, ISBN 978-0-226-30416-8. Despite professing the anti-Qing cause, the Guangfuhui was highly critical of Sun Yat-sen.Wang, Ke-wen. [1998] (1998).

One of the most famous female revolutionaries was Qiu Jin, who fought for women's rights and was also from Guangfuhui. There were also many other minor revolutionary organizations, such as Lizhi Xuehui (勵志學會) in Jiangsu, Gongqianghui (公強會) in Sichuan, Yiwenhui (益聞會) and Hanzudulihui (漢族獨立會) in Fujian, Yizhishe (易知社) in Jiangxi, Yuewanghui (岳王會) in Anhui and Qunzhihui (群智會/群智社) in Guangzhou.中国人民大学. 书报资料中心.

This is the revolutionary group that would eventually develop a strong link with the later Communist Party.  Sun Yat-sen successfully united the Revive China Society, Huaxinghui and Guangfuhui in the summer of 1905, thereby establishing the unified Tongmenghui (United League) in August 1905 in Tokyo. While it started in Tokyo, it had loose organizations distributed across and outside the country. Sun Yat-sen was the leader of this unified group. Other revolutionaries who worked with the Tongmenghui include Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin. When the Tongmenhui was established, more than 90% of the Tongmenhui members were between 17 and 26 years of age.Etō, Shinkichi. Schiffrin, Harold Z. [2008] (2008). China's Republican Revolution.

A nucleus of attendees of this conference evolved into the Tongmenhui's establishment in Hubei. In July 1907, several members of Tongmenhui in Tokyo advocated a revolution in the area of the Yangtze River.

In Tokyo Liu Shipei propounded the overthrow of the Manchus and a return to Chinese classical values. In Paris, Li Shizhen, Wu Zhihui, and Zhang Renjie agreed with Sun on the necessity of revolution and joined the Tongmenghui, but argued that a political replacement of one government with another government would not be progress; revolution in family, gender, and social values would remove the need for government and coercion. Zhang Ji was among the anarchists who defended assassination and terrorism as a means toward revolution, but others insisted that only education was justifiable. Important anarchists included Cai Yuanpei, Wang Jingwei, and Zhang Renjie, who gave Sun major financial help. Many of these anarchists would later assumed high positions in the Kuomintang (KMT).

Many revolutionaries promoted anti-Qing/anti-Manchu sentiments and revived memories of conflict between the ethnic minority Manchu and the ethnic majority Han Chinese from the late Ming dynasty (1368–1644).  Leading intellectuals were influenced by books that had survived from the last years of the Ming dynasty, the last dynasty of Han Chinese. In 1904, Sun Yat-sen announced that his organization's goal was "to expel the Tatar barbarians, to revive Zhonghua, to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the people."

Many of the underground groups promoted the ideas of "Resist Qing and restore Ming" (反清復明) that had been around since the days of the Taiping Rebellion.楊碧玉. 洪秀全政治人格之研究. 秀威資訊科技股份有限公司 Publishing. ISBN 986-221-141-5, ISBN 978-986-221-141-0. Others, such as Zhang Binglin, supported straight-up lines like "slay the manchus" and concepts like "Anti-Manchuism" (興漢滅胡 / 排滿主義).Crossley, Pamela Kyle.

The Xinhai Revolution was supported by many groups, including students and intellectuals who returned from abroad, as well as participants of the revolutionary organizations, overseas Chinese, soldiers of the new army, local gentry, farmers and others.  Assistance from overseas Chinese was important in the Xinhai Revolution. In 1894, the first year of the Revive China Society, the first meeting ever held by the group was held in the home of Ho Fon, an overseas Chinese who was the leader of the first Chinese Church of Christ.Lee, Khoon Choy Lee.

In 1906, after the abolition of the imperial examinations, the Qing government established many new schools and encouraged students to study abroad. Many young people attended the new schools or went abroad to study in places like Japan.Fenby, Jonathan. [2008] (2008). The History of Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power. ISBN 978-0-7139-9832-0. pg 96. pg 106. A new class of intellectuals emerged from those students, who contributed immensely to the Xinhai Revolution. Besides Sun Yat-sen, key figures in the revolution, such as Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, Hu Hanmin, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin and Wang Jingwei, were all Chinese students in Japan. Some were young students like Zou Rong, known for writing the book Revolutionary Army, in which he talked about the extermination of the Manchus for the 260 years of oppression, sorrow, cruelty and tyranny and turned the sons and grandsons of Yellow Emperor into George Washingtons.Fenby, Jonathan. [2008] (2008). The History of Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power. ISBN 978-0-7139-9832-0. pg 109. Before 1908, revolutionaries focused on coordinating these organizations in preparation for uprisings that these organizations would launch; hence, these groups would provide most of the manpower needed for the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. After the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen recalled the days of recruiting support for the revolution and said, "The literati were deeply into the search for honors and profits, so they were regarded as having only secondary importance. By contrast, organizations like Sanhehui were able to sow widely the ideas of resisting the Qing and restoring the Ming."Complete works of Sun Yat-sen 《總理全集》 First edition, page 920  The strength of the gentry in local politics had become apparent. From December 1908, the Qing government created some apparatus to allow the gentry and businessmen to participate in politics. These middle-class people were originally supporters of constitutionalism. However, they became disenchanted when the Qing government created a cabinet with Prince Qing as prime minister.Rhoads, Edward J. M. [2000] (2000).

By early 1911, an experimental cabinet had thirteen members, nine of whom were Manchus selected from the imperial family.Wang, Ke-wen. [1998] (1998).

Besides Chinese and overseas Chinese, some of the supporters and participants of the Xinhai Revolution were foreigners; among them, the Japanese were the most active group. Some Japanese even became members of Tongmenghui. Miyazaki Touten was the closest Japanese supporter; others included Heiyama Shu and Ryōhei Uchida.  Homer Lea, an American, who became Sun Yat-sen's closest foreign advisor in 1910, supported Sun Yat-sen's military ambitions. British soldier Rowland J. Mulkern also took part in the revolution.Lau, Kit-ching Chan. [1990] (1990). China, Britain and Hong Kong, 1895–1945. Chinese University Press. ISBN 962-201-409-7, ISBN 978-962-201-409-1. pg 37.  Some foreigners, such as English explorer Arthur de Carle Sowerby, led expeditions to rescue foreign missionaries in 1911 and 1912.  The New Army was formed in 1901 after the defeat of the Qings in the First Sino-Japanese War. They were launched by a decree from eight provinces. New Army troops were by far the best trained and equipped. The recruits were of a higher quality than the old army and received regular promotions. Beginning in 1908, the revolutionaries began to shift their call to the new armies. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionaries infiltrated the New Army.Spence, Jonathan D. [1990] (1990).

The central focus of the uprisings were mostly connected with the Tongmenghui and Sun Yat-sen, including subgroups. Some uprisings involved groups that never merged with the Tongmenghui. Sun Yat-sen may have participated in 8–10 uprisings; all uprisings prior to the failed Wuchang Uprising.  In the spring of 1895, the Revive China Society, which was based in Hong Kong, planned the First Guangzhou Uprising (廣州起義). Lu Haodong was tasked with designing the revolutionaries' Blue Sky with a White Sun flag.  On October 26, 1895, Yeung Ku-wan and Sun Yat-sen led Zheng Shiliang and Lu Haodong to Guangzhou, preparing to capture Guangzhou in one strike. However, the details of their plans were leaked to the Qing government.計秋楓, 朱慶葆. [2001] (2001). 中國近代史, Volume 1. Chinese University Press. ISBN 962-201-987-0, ISBN 978-962-201-987-4. pg 464. The government began to arrest revolutionaries, including Lu Haodong, who was later executed.  The first Guangzhou uprising was a failure. Under pressure from the Qing government, the government of Hong Kong forbade these two men to enter the territory for five years. Sun Yat-sen went into exile, promoting the Chinese revolution and raising funds in Japan, the United States, Canada and Britain. In 1901, following the Huizhou uprising, Yeung Ku-wan was assassinated by Qing agents in Hong Kong.South China morning post. April 6, 2011. Waiting may be over at grave of an unsung hero. After his death, his family protected his identity by not putting his name on his tomb, just a number: 6348. In 1901, after the Boxer Rebellion started, Tang Caichang (唐才常) and Tan Sitong of the previous Foot Emancipation Society organised the Independence Army. The Independence Army Uprising (自立軍起義) was planned to occur on August 23, 1900.Wang, Ke-wen. [1998] (1998). Modern China: an encyclopedia of history, culture, and nationalism.

Their plot was discovered by the governor general of Hunan and Hubei. About twenty conspirators were arrested and executed. On October 8, 1900, Sun Yat-sen ordered the launch of the Huizhou Uprising (惠州起義).Gao, James Zheng. [2009] (2009). Historical dictionary of modern China (1800–1949). Scarecrow Press.

However, after the Japanese Prime Minister prohibited Sun Yat-sen from carrying out revolutionary activities on Taiwan, Zheng Shiliang had no choice but to order the army to disperse. This uprising therefore also failed. British soldier Rowland J. Mulkern participated in this uprising.  A very short uprising occurred from January 25 to 28, 1903, to establish a "Great Ming Heavenly kingdom" (大明順天國).陳錫祺. [1991] (1991). 孫中山年谱長編 volume 1. 中华书局. ISBN 7-101-00685-X, 9787101006858.

The uprising recruited miners as early as 1903 to rise against the Qing ruling class. After the uprising failed, Ma Fuyi was executed. Wu Yue (吳樾) of Guangfuhui carried out an assassination attempt at the Beijing Zhengyangmen East Railway station (正陽門車站) in an attack on five Qing officials on September 24, 1905.

The Revolutionary party, along with Xu Xueqiu (許雪秋), Chen Yongpo (陳湧波) and Yu Tongshi (余通實), launched the uprising and captured Huanggang city.  Other Japanese that followed include (萱野長知) and (池亨吉). After the uprising began, the Qing government quickly and forcefully suppressed it. Around 200 revolutionaries were killed. In the same year, Sun Yat-sen sent more revolutionaries to Huizhou to launch the "Huizhou Qinuhu Uprising" (惠州七女湖起義).張豈之, 陳振江, 江沛. [2002] (2002). 晚淸民國史. Volume 5 of 中國歷史. 五南圖書出版股份有限公司 publishing.

The Qing army fled in disorder, and the revolutionaries exploited the opportunity, capturing several towns. They defeated the Qing army once again in Bazhiyie. Many organizations voiced their support after the uprising, and the number of revolutionary forces increased to two hundred men at its height. The uprising, however, ultimately failed.  On July 6, 1907, Xu Xilin of Guangfuhui led an uprising in Anqing, Anhui, which became known as the Anqing Uprising (安慶起義). Xu Xilin at the time was the police commissioner as well as the supervisor of the police academy. He led an uprising that was to assassinate the provincial governor of Anhui, En Ming (恩銘).Lu Xun.

After that, they attempted to besiege and capture Qinzhou, but they were unsuccessful. They eventually retreated to the area of Shiwandashan, while Wang Heshun returned to Vietnam. On December 1, 1907, the Zhennanguan Uprising (鎮南關起事) took place at Zhennanguan, a pass on the Chinese-Vietnamese border.

The attack was successful, but after news arrived that Puyi was about to abdicate, Ma agreed to join the new Republic. The revolutionaries established the "Qinlong Fuhan Military Government" and elected Zhang Fenghui, a member of the Yuanrizhi Society (原日知會), as new governor.

During and after the Xinhai Revolution, many groups that participated wanted their own pennant as the national flag. During the Wuchang Uprising, the military units of Wuchang wanted the nine-star flag with Taijitu.Fitzgerald, John. [1998] (1998).

Others in competition included Lu Haodong's Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. Huang Xing favored a flag bearing the mythical "well-field" system of village agriculture. In the end, the assembly compromised: the national flag would be the banner of Five Races Under One Union. The Five Races Under One Union flag with horizontal stripes represented the five major nationalities of the republic.劉煒. 陳萬雄. 張債儀. [2002] (2002) Chinese civilization in a new light 中華文明傳真#10 清.

Despite the general target of the uprisings to be the Manchus, Sun Yat-sen, Song Jiaoren and Huang Xing unanimously advocated racial integration to be carried out from the mainland to the frontiers.Hsiao-ting Lin.

On January 16, while returning to his residence, Yuan Shikai was ambushed in a bomb attack organized by the Tongmenghui in Donghuamen (東華門), Tientsin, Beijing.邵建.

About ten of the guards died, but Yuan himself was not seriously injured. He sent a message to the revolutionaries the next day pledging his loyalty and asking them not to organize any more assassination attempts against him.   Zhang Jian drafted an abdication proposal that was approved by the Provisional Senate. On January 20, Wu Tingfang of the Nanking Provisional government officially delivered the imperial edict of abdication to Yuan Shikai for the abdication of Puyi. On January 22, Sun Yat-sen announced that he would resign the presidency in favor of Yuan Shikai if the latter supported the emperor's abdication.Boorman, Howard L. Howard, Richard C. Cheng, Joseph K. H. [1970] (1970). Biographical dictionary of Republican China, V. 3. Columbia University Press. ISBN 0-231-08957-0, ISBN 978-0-231-08957-9. Yuan then pressured Empress Dowager Longyu with the threat that the lives of the imperial family would not be spared if abdication did not come before the revolutionaries reached Beijing, but if they agree to abdicate, the provisional government would honor the terms proposed by the imperial family. On February 3, Empress Dowager Longyu gave Yuan full permission to negotiate the abdication terms of the Qing emperor. Yuan then drew up his own version and forwarded it to the revolutionaries on February 3. His version consisted of three sections instead of two. On February 12, 1912, after being pressured by Yuan and other ministers, Puyi (age six) and Empress Dowager Longyu accepted Yuan's terms of abdication.  As a condition for ceding leadership to Yuan Shikai, Sun Yat-sen insisted that the provisional government remain in Nanjing. On February 14, the Provisional Senate initially voted 20-5 in favor of making Beijing the capital over Nanjing, with two votes going for Wuhan and one for Tianjin.(Chinese) 胡绳武 "民国元年定都之争" 民国档案 p.1 2010-12-08 The Senate majority wanted to secure the peace agreement by taking power in Beijing. Zhang Jian and others reasoned that having the capital in Beijing would check against Manchu restoration and Mongol secession. But Sun and Huang Xing argued in favor of Nanjing to balance against Yuan's power base in the north. Li Yuanhong presented Wuhan as a compromise.(Chinese) 胡绳武 "民国元年定都之" 民国档案 p. 2 2010-12-08 The next day, the Provisional Senate voted again, this time, 19-6 in favor of Nanjing with two votes for Wuhan. Sun sent a delegation led by Cai Yuanpei and Wang Jingwei to persuade Yuan to move to Nanjing.(Chinese) 胡绳武 "民国元年定都之争" 民国档案 p. 3 2010-12-08 Yuan welcomed the delegation and agreed to accompany the delegates back to the south.(Chinese) 胡绳武 "民国元年定都之争" 民国档案 p. 4 2010-12-08 Then on the evening of February 29, riots and fires broke out in all over the city.  They were allegedly started by disobedient troops of Cao Kun, a loyal officer of Yuan. The disorder gave Yuan the pretext to stay in the north to guard against unrest. On March 10, Yuan was inaugurated in Beijing as the provisional president of the Republic of China.(Chinese) 胡绳武 "民国元年定都之争" 民国档案 p. 2 2010-12-08 On April 5, the Provisional Senate in Nanjing voted to make Beijing the capital of the Republic and convened in Beijing at the end of the month.   On March 10, 1912, Yuan Shikai was sworn as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China in Beijing.Fu, Zhengyuan. [1993] (1993). Autocratic tradition and Chinese politics: Zhengyuan Fu. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-44228-1, ISBN 978-0-521-44228-2. pg 154. The government based in Beijing, called the Beiyang Government, was not internationally recognized as the legitimate government of the Republic of China until 1928, so the period from 1912 until 1928 was known simply as the "Beiyang Period". The first National Assembly election took place according to the Provisional Constitution. While in Beijing, the Kuomintang was formed on August 25, 1912.Hsueh, Chun-tu. Xue, Jundu. [1961] (1961). Huang Hsing and the Chinese revolution. Stanford University Press. ISBN 0-8047-0031-1, ISBN 978-0-8047-0031-3. The KMT held the majority of seats after the election. Song Jiaoren was elected as premier. However, Song was assassinated in Shanghai on March 20, 1913, under the secret order of Yuan Shikai.Fu, Zhengyuan. [1993] (1993).

Some advocated that a Han be installed as Emperor, either the descendant of Confucius, who was the Duke Yansheng, or the Ming dynasty Imperial family descendant, the Marquis of Extended Grace. The American Christian Rev. Dr. George F. Pentecost spoke out against western imperialism, saying: As for the Chinese, I have the highest opinion not only of the Chinese character, but of the Chinese fitness for self-government. I think they are eminently fitted to make a republic successful. China, for instance, is infinitely better fitted than is Russia for development along republican lines. In fact, China has always been practically a republic. It has had its dynasties of rulers, but the political unit of China has always been the village. The village people have always had their influence upon the Government. What is more, the average Chinaman is intelligent. After the revolution, there was a huge outpouring of anti-Manchu sentiment through China, but particularly in Beijing where thousands died in anti-Manchu violence as Imperial restrictions on Han residency and behavior within the city crumbled as Manchu Imperial power crumbled. Anti-Manchu sentiment is recorded in books like A Short History of Slaves (奴才小史) and The Biographies of Avaricious Officials and Corrupt Personnel (貪官污吏傳) by Laoli (老吏). During the abdication of the last emperor, Empress Dowager Longyu, Yuan Shikai and Sun Yat-sen both tried to adopt the concept of "Manchu and Han as one family" (滿漢一家).Rhoads, Edward J. M.

This new search of identity was the New Culture Movement.Tanner, Harold M. [2010] (2010). "China: From the Great Qing Empire through the People's Republic of China 1644-2009" Volume 2 of China: A History. Hackett Publishing. ISBN 1-60384-204-7, ISBN 978-1-60384-204-4. pg 123. Manchu culture and language, on the contrary, has become virtually extinct by 2007. Unlike revolutions in the West, the Xinhai Revolution did not restructure society. The participants of the Xinhai Revolution were mostly military personnel, old-type bureaucrats, and local gentries. These people still held regional power after the Xinhai Revolution. Some became warlords. There were no major improvements in the standard of living. Writer Lu Xun commented in 1921 during the publishing of The True Story of Ah Q, ten years after the Xinhai Revolution, that basically nothing changed except "the Manchus have left the kitchen".Fenby, Jonathan. [2008] (2008). The History of Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power. ISBN 978-0-7139-9832-0. pg 143. The economic problems were not addressed until the governance of Chiang Ching-kuo in Taiwan and Deng Xiaoping on the mainland. The Xinhai Revolution mainly got rid of feudalism (fengjian) from Late Imperial China. In the usual view of historians, there are two restorations of feudal power after the revolution: the first was Yuan Shikai; the second was Zhang Xun.Yan, Jiaqi Yan. Hong, David S. K. Mair, Denis C. [1992] (1992). Toward a democratic China: the intellectual autobiography of Yan Jiaqi. University of Hawaii press. ISBN 0-8248-1501-7, ISBN 978-0-8248-1501-1. pg 189, 251. Both were unsuccessful, but the "feudal remnants" returned to China with the Cultural Revolution in a concept called guanxi, where people relied not on feudal relationships, but personal relationships, for survival.Yang, Mayfair Mei-hui. [1994] (1994). Gifts, favors, and banquets: the art of social relationships in China. Cornell University Press. ISBN 0-8014-9592-X, 9780801495922. Pg 146-147. While guanxi is helpful in Taiwan, on the mainland, guanxi is necessary to get anything done.Luo, Yadong. [2007] (2007). Guanxi and business. Volume 5 of Asia-Pacific business series. World Scientific. ISBN 981-270-046-3, ISBN 978-981-270-046-9. pg 26. The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing government and two thousand years of monarchy. Throughout Chinese history, old dynasties had always been replaced by new dynasties. The Xinhai Revolution, however, was the first to overthrow a monarchy completely and attempt to establish a republic to spread democratic ideas throughout China. Though in 1911 at the provisional government welcome ceremony, Sun Yat-sen said, "The revolution is not yet successful, the comrades still need to strive for the future." (革命尚未成功，同志仍需努力).陸韻葭. [2006] (2006). 上海玩全指南. Travelcom press. ISBN 986-7143-13-2, ISBN 978-986-7143-13-6. pg 49. Since the 1920s, the two dominant parties–the KMT and CPC–see the Xinhai Revolution quite differently.South China morning post. March 29, 2011. Replacing Chairman Mao with Sun Yat-sen. Both sides recognize Sun Yat-sen as the Father of the Nation, but in Taiwan, they mean "Father of the Republic of China". On the mainland, Sun Yat-sen was seen as the man who helped bring down the Qing, a pre-condition for the Communist state founded in 1949. The PRC views Sun's work as the first step towards the real revolution in 1949, when the communists set up a truly independent state that expelled foreigners and built a military and industrial power. The father of New China is seen as Mao Zedong. In 1954, Liu Shaoqi was quoted as saying that the "Xinhai Revolution inserted the concept of a republic into common people". Zhou Enlai pointed out that the "Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing rule, ended 2000 years of monarchy, and liberated the mind of people to a great extent, and opened up the path for the development of future revolution. This is a great victory."  A change in the belief that the revolution had been a generally positive change began in the late 1980s and 1990s, but Zhang Shizhao was quoted as arguing that "When talking about the Xinhai Revolution, the theorist these days tends to overemphasize. The word 'success' was way overused." The success of the democracy gained from the revolution can vary depending on one's view. Even after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, for sixty years, the KMT controlled all five branches of the government; none were independent.South China morning post. Sun Yat-sen and the centenary of the Xinhai revolution. 4 July 2010. Yan Jiaqi, founder of the Federation for a Democratic China, has said that Sun Yat-sen is to be credited as founding China's first republic in 1912, and the second republic is the people of Taiwan and the political parties there now democratizing the region. Meanwhile, the ideals of democracy are far from realised on the mainland. For example, the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao once said in a speech that without real democracy, there is no guarantee of economic and political rights; but he led a 2011 crackdown against the peaceful Chinese jasmine protests. Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy activist who received the global 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, is in prison. Others, such as Qin Yongmin (秦永敏) of the Democracy Party of China, who was only released from prison after twelve years, do not praise the Xinhai Revolution. Qin Yongmin said the revolution only replaced one dictator with another, that Mao Zedong was not an emperor, but he is worse than the emperor.
