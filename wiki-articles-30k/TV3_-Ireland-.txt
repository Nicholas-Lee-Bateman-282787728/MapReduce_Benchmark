    TV3 is a commercial free-to-air television network operated within Ireland. The channel is owned by Liberty Global and operated through its subsidiary Virgin Media Ireland. The channel launched on 20 September 1998 becoming the country's first commercial broadcaster. In October 1988, the Independent Radio and Television Commission (IRTC) was set up to regulate new independent stations. Following this TV3 was intended to the the Republic of Ireland's third terrestrial channel. The original broadcasting licence was granted to a consortium Tullamore Beta Ltd in 1990 (some of this consortium made up of Windmill Lane Productions and Paul McGuinness. It was envisaged that the channel would broadcast on cable and MMDS, but it was later decided that the channel should broadcast on terrestrial television similar to other Irish channels. TV3's broadcast was further delayed when IRTC revoked the broadcasting licence due to delays in broadcasting the channel. After a court battle the licence was eventually restored in 1993. By 1993 an agreement was made to sell 49 per cent of the company to UTV, to raise much-needed cash for investment in facilities. However, UTV pulled out of negotiations in 1995, after TV3 tried to convince existing MMDS and cable television providers to drop UTV and replace it with TV3. Cable operators declined to drop UTV Northern Ireland from its line-up. In 1997, Canadian communications company Canwest bought a major stake in the new company. In 2001, Granada purchased a 45% share in the company. By 2006 the group was sold to Doughty Hanson & Co. In 2015, Liberty Global confirmed it planned to purchase the TV3 Group, approval to purchase the broadcaster was given on 2 October 2015 by the CCPChttp://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/attachment.php?attachmentid=364474&d=1443830705 A timeshift channel TV3 +1 launched on 2 December 2014 on UPC Ireland.https://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/media-and-marketing/a-new-dawn-for-tv3-as-it-goes-on-the-counter-attack-1.2007363https://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/media-and-marketing/a-new-dawn-for-tv3-as-it-goes-on-the-counter-attack-1.2007363?page=2  The channel was added to Sky Ireland on 8 April 2015. However, the channel is unavailable to viewers on Saorview, as TV3 are in dispute with its operator 2RN (formerly a subsidiary of RTÉ). TV3 HD is a high definition version of TV3, both domestic and imported programming is available in HD, mainly sporting content. TV3 HD launched on Virgin Media Ireland and Sky Ireland on 11 August 2015. It is anticipated TV3 will utilize its existing TV3 Sony HD studios in Ballymount where a number of their shows already broadcast from such as Ireland:AM, Xposé, Tonight with Vincent Browne and TV3 News. The service is currently unavailable on Saorview. TV3 broadcasts a wide range of programming which in its early years depended heavily on international acquisitions. In 2008, the TV3 Group produced a three-year strategy to increase the amount of homegrown productions on the channel. Under their contract with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI), TV3 are required since 2008 to have 30% of their programming coming from Ireland though TV3 now produces 40% Irish produced content (Most of this content comes from in studio productions such as Ireland AM and Xposé). In 2010 TV3 announced a target of 50% Irish programming by 2012. TV3 has also confirmed its plan to build a major new studio in 2011 which will be fully HD capable with audience capacity. They have a small staff of 200 employees to run two television channels and one on-demand online service. On average, TV3 spend about €10 million on internal productions which are generally for daytime viewers. They do not have a history of strong prime-time content: generally their home produced programmes consist of at least one independently produced programme, e.g. The Apprentice, a number of internal documentaries such as Ireland Undercover and a number of BCI licence fee-funded independent products such as School Run, Diary of...  and Modern Ireland. As of October 2009, TV3 claim they are the most watched television channel by people aged 15–24 years old. This group was previously captured by RTÉ One. This is an important group to capture as it is often these viewers whom advertisers wish to target. In reaction to this press release from TV3, RTÉ rebutted their claims stating that RTÉ One outdoes TV3 in far more demographic categories and that TV3's press release, "In terms of the selective audiences focussed upon by TV3 in their release, it's clear this is a recent phenomenon and only pertains to a narrow sub-demographic of young viewers in this country. By contrast, the year-to-date equivalent (1 January – 20 October), all day national share, sees RTÉ One with a 16.2% share of the 15-24s; TV3 with a 13.3% share." In 2009 TV3 had revenues of €54,300,000. In the previous year (2008), TV3 received €62 million in advertising revenue. Increases in programme cost during 2008 included new sporting contracts with the GAA and UEFA, the first renewal of their contract with the British broadcaster ITV for shows such as The X Factor and Coronation Street, a small but significant increase in programmes commissioned from independent producers . They also increased their investment in online technology, with their online service earning a profit for the first time. In 2008, TV3 received €3 million in funding from the licence fee for independent productions on the channel. In 2009, two rounds of redundancies reduced TV3 staff to 213 people. Staff savings have been augmented by agreed reductions in wages. The 200 staff working in TV3 now provide seven hours of live television five days a week, an increase of two hours and a staff reduction of 50 since 2007. In February 2012 the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) restructure TV3's outstanding loans to the bank. The owners of TV3, Doherty Hanson & Co., have loans of €140million with the bank. €51million will continue to be repaid over the next 5 years, while €81.1 will be frozen until a "liquidity event", according to the IBRC this is in the event of a sale of TV3. Product placement within Irish produced programming had previously been banned by broadcasting authorities in Ireland, though in the past Irish viewers have been used to product placement as seen on US television and film productions. Due to an EU ruling made in 2007, Irish broadcasters can now place products within programming mainly entertainment shows, though excludes programming which is deemed mainly 'news and current affairs' and programming aimed at children. On 15 August 2011 it was confirmed that TV3 would become the first official broadcaster to implement the new broadcasting terms. Kenco reportedly paid TV3 Group a six-figure sum to place their branding on two key early morning television shows mainly, The Morning Show and Midday from September 2011. Similar to RTÉ and TG4 broadcasters will have to air a logo 'PP' at the beginning and end of the show to inform viewers that products will appear on the show. RTÉ Television has previously used Product Placement on its series The Late Late Show. TV3 programming has often been criticised for having no  "distinctive, clearly Irish identity". In spring 2008, a major effort was made by the station to change this situation. In general TV3 spend around €10 million on their Irish productions each year, in 2008 they significantly increased the number of prime time shows produced in Ireland. Under current broadcasting legislation TV3 are required to use 15% of its total Irish production budget for Independent Productions. Since 2004 Independent Productions for TV3 have been able to avail of the BAI's Sound and Vision Fund, a fund provided to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) from the Licence Fee.

This marks the first time Big Brother has aired in on an Irish TV channel and while being available to more Irish audiences since the show transferred from Channel 4 to Channel 5 in 2011. TV3 routinely disagree with RTÉ Television's policy of purchasing US, Canadian and Australian imports which RTÉ subsequently broadcasts after midnight with low audience figures. TV3 argue that if made available to them they could air such shows in prime-time slots. In the past such shows as Rookie Blue, Rescue Me, Big Love, United States of Tara, Tangle and The Secret Life of Us have been purchased by RTÉ and aired between 00:00 and 06:00 on RTÉ Two. RTÉ have argued that TV3 have rarely gone after the same types of Imported programming and that such shows perform better than when broadcast in Prime Time on TV3.  September 1998 – July 2000: The original logo and design for the channel was devised by Dynamo. In the lead-up to the network's launch, TV3's logo was unveiled during promotion ads on RTÉ and TG4. The logo consisted of a redesigned number 3. The upper half of the 3 was separated from the lower half; the two halves came together to form two swooshing arches that would form the 3. There were a number of different idents from September 1998 to July 2000 including 'Bubbles', 'Camera Lenses', 'Robot', 'Umbrella', 'Fan', 'Planets', 'Children's Toy', 'Bumper Cars' and 'Roller-Coaster'. Each of the idents would end with a girl whispering the word 'three' a number of times. July 2000 – September 2003 In July 2000, TV3 developed new idents. The new idents removed the words 'TVthree' from beneath the stylized 3 logo. The project was directed by Dynamo's creative head of broadcast media, Brian Williams. These were TV3's first idents to feature live action – actors would be seen in the background of the logo doing various day-to-day activities with the 3 logo spinning around to reveal itself. In 2001, some of these idents would have characters from Granada TV programming appear in the background, such as characters from Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Heartbeat. September 2003 – March 2006: In September 2003, TV3 again launched a new set of idents. Again, this series of idents consisted of live action scenes. The final scene would see a large 'swoosh' effect in the center of the screen with the 3 logo appearing in the centre of the screen. These idents consisted of outdoor activities such as a walk at the beach, children playing football, children playing, people walking over the Ha'penny bridge etc. The presentation package was produced by Bruce Dunlop Associates.  March 2006 – January 2009: In March 2006, TV3 took steps to rebrand, as Channel 6 launched in an attempt to become a competitor in the Irish market. These idents consisted of live action scenes often involving the number 3 such as three drops of water into a river. The 3 logo now moved from just the stylized 3 into three circles with the stylized 3 in the last circle. The presentation package was produced by Cleverality. January 2009 – August 2009: In January 2009, TV3 unveiled its new station logo – a simple sans-serif number 3 similar in style to that of TV3 (Viasat)'s logo. This revamp coincided with the launch of 3e. Officially, the TV3 logo is that of a box with a 3 cut out of the right hand side – this design is used on all news programmes. However, the idents consisted of a set of simple graphical 3s in a domino effect with different colours such as grey, purple and blue. The idents were produced by Image Now.  August 2009 – August 2011: Between August 2009 and February 2009 TV3 introduced 8 new idents. The first two idents – known as 'Orchard' and 'Elevator' – launched TV3's live action idents. In September, a third ident entitled 'Wave' was added, followed in October by a fourth ident known as 'Bridge'. A edited version of the Bridge ident (to promote the series V), a sixth new ident known as 'Dog' was introduced in November 2009 and in December 2009 the ident 'snowman' was added and in February 2010 the 8th ident was added, 'bubbles'. TV3 has been working with Image Now to create these idents. August 2011 – January 2015: On Monday, 22 August 2011, TV3 revealed a new on-air look. While utilising its existing logo, TV3 revealed new idents which are computer-generated and based around specific themes (e.g.: crime, urban, entertainment). The new look idents were designed by Image Now, who have previously worked on the channel's branding since 2009. January 2015 – Present: On Monday, 5 January 2015, TV3 revealed a new on-air look to coincide with its new programming. Originally the new idents consisted of only two idents, gradually TV3 added additional idents featuring TV3 presenters. One of the original idents features a neon TV3 logo in a purple room and the second ident features a scene from their new soap 'Redrock'. The slogan, 'We Entertain', features heavily on-air and in promos. TV3's continuity is largely pre-recorded unlike its competitors RTÉ One and UTV Ireland. Tara Loughrey Grant began as a continuity presenter on TV3 in 1999 and was the voice of TV3 until 2005, where she later moved onto radio and then onto Channel 6 (prior to TV3 Group purchasing the channel). She then went onto present RTÉ Ten from 2008 onward and regularly contributes to RTÉ Radio and television. Conor Clear and Andrea Hayes followed as continuity presenters. In 2008, TV3 introduced in-vision continuity links during the 3 Daytime. Hayes began as a guest on the Midday panelist in summer 2013. She also works on Dublin's Sunshine FM. Clare McKenna is a voice-over artist and has been working for TV3 since 2006. In 2013, McKenna begun a career as television presenting on Ireland AM whilst covering for Anna Daly when she was on her maternity leave. Upon Daly's return McKenna left Ireland AM so she could take up her own maternity leave. McKenna returned to TV3 in late 2014 reprising her role as a voice-over for TV3 promotions. Daytime in-vision continuity lasted until the end of 2009. In the early years of TV3 many media commentators have criticised the lack of original programming on the station, since 2008 TV3 have increased their production of Irish programming. The view of many commentators such as Stephen Price of The Sunday Times and Tom McGurk of The Sunday Business Post is that TV3 need to differentiate themselves in the growing Irish multi-channel market by making more original programming than they had previously.  Play TV was an interactive phone-in quiz show on TV3: it ran from May 2009 until March 2010. On 21 September 2009, callers to the Liveline radio show on RTÉ Radio 1 complained about the phone charges and methods surrounding TV3's late night quiz show Play TV. Host Joe Duffy stated that many of his listeners and callers to the show had not got a satisfactory reply from TV3 in relation to their complaints and hence his reason for this section of the his show, and that TV3 was unwilling to be a part of the discussion show having been asked by RTÉ Radio. Some of the contestants had not been paid their prize money. TV3 advised viewers who played the game to go to RegTel with any complaints. On 25 September 2009, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) met to review 20 complaints made to it by individuals in relation to Play TV; 15 were upheld, 1 was rejected, 1 was determined to be invalid and 2 remained under investigation. In January 2010, the compliance committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld 10 more complaints against TV3. In February the BAI up held 3 more complaints. On 5 March 2010, TV3 announced that Play TV's contract was terminated immediately. In their statement they put the removal of the "infomercial" down purely to audience figures rather than the complaints received and upheld by the BAI. They did not apologise for their conduct. At the launch of TV3's Autumn (18 August 2010) schedule David McRedmond (CEO TV3) was interviewed by The Irish Times where he admitted mistakes had been made but and admitted that Play TV was axed not just due to falling audience figures but also to the bad press and the regulator's constant scrutiny of the show. He still refused to apologise to viewers on behalf of TV3 again stating that "It was an essential part of getting us through the recession" regardless of what the BAI called a "misleading and unfair" programme. Brain Box is an interactive phone-in quiz show on UTV and STV. As part of their Autumn schedule 2010 TV3 announced the re-broadcast of UTV's Brainbox TV show. The show began airing on TV3 on 9 September 2010, just 7 months after the axing of the controversial Play TV. It ceased broadcasting less than a week later. On Saturday, 26 December 2009, TV3 News announced that it had been informed that the then Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan was suffering from a serious illness. The announcement was made according to TV3 as it was for the public good, many people were outraged at the way it was announced on TV3. Senior government sources spoke of "outrage" across the political spectrum at the insensitive content and tone of a news bulletin broadcast, which the station had earlier flagged as a "news story of national importance". However, the station's decision was defended by The Irish Times and the political magazine The Phoenix. The BAI ruled in favour of TV3 in relation to this announcement, rejecting all 14 complaints made against TV3 to the regulator. TV3 at the time also stated that the bulletin was a normal bulletin that would normal run at 5:30, however TV3 are not known to produced a news bulletin on St. Stephens' Day (a Bank Holiday in Ireland) and since 2006 had reduced their weekend bulletins to 5 minutes.  Psychic Readings Live was a phone-in programme broadcast June–December 2012. It was much criticised for some apparently faked callers and psychics and for playing on the hopes and fears of some viewers. Complaints about it were upheld by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, and it was cancelled in December 2012.      Life was a new prime time weekly show set to begin airing in February 2015. TV3 had announced Life as a daily half hour to broadcast at 19:30 Monday to Friday. By early 2015, TV3 confirmed the show would not go ahead originally as planned but would broadcast for a short 6 week run each Friday from 20:00. Life was expected to be hosted by  TV3's Aisling O'Loughlin and Sybil Mulcahy, instead Mulcahy took on the presenting role for the 6 week run. As of spring 2015, Mulcahy has confirmed her departure from TV3 taking effect from late summer 2015. TV3 announced in January 2015 that its afternoon show Late Lunch Live would be dropped in favour of The 7 O'Clock Show. The 7 O'Clock Show will air at 19:00 for an hour Monday to Friday on TV3. In a special upfront event in June 2015, The Great Irish Menu and House Rules would make-up some of the channels autumn/winter schedule.
