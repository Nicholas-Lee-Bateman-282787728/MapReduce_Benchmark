Arena is an artist with the vocal range of a soprano and is multilingual: she sings live and records in English, Italian and French, as well as in Spanish. In April 2013 she was voted Australia's all-time greatest female singer and third greatest singer overall in an industry poll conducted by music journalist, Cameron Adams, for the Herald Sun. Arena has earned several international and national awards, including seven ARIA Awards, and two World Music Awards for 'Best-selling Australian Artist', which she received in 1996 and in 2000. In 2009, Arena became the first Australian to be awarded the Knighthood of the Order of National Merit – presented by the President of the French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy, for her contributions to French culture, and ceremoniously awarded by Frédéric Mitterrand, the Minister of Culture and Communication of France. In 2012, Arena appeared as a judge and mentor on the revival of the Australian television variety programme Young Talent Time: the original Young Talent Time series had made her a household name in the 1970s and 1980s, as Tiny Tina, which screened on Network Ten from 1971 to 1988. In October 2013, Arena released her first English album of original material in eleven years, titled Reset. In the same month, Arena published her first autobiography, titled Now I Can Dance, which is now in its fourth reprint. Also in 2013, Arena participated in the 13th Australian series of Dancing with the Stars, reaching third place behind Cosentino and Rhiannon Fish respectively.

[ ] In October 2015, Arena released her eleventh studio album, Eleven which became her 7th Top 10 album in Australia by debuting at No. 2 on the ARIA album chart. In November 2015, Arena was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame at the 2015 ARIA Awards ceremony. On 'Australia Day' - 26 January 2016 - Arena has been recognised in the Australia Day honors, which the country's sovereign awards its citizens for actions or deeds that benefit the nation. Arena has been appointed as a 'Member in the General Division of the Order Of Australia' - Order of Australia - in recognition of her contribution to the arts, representing Australia on the world stage and philanthropic work. Arena was born to Giuseppe "Joe" Arena and Francesca "Franca" Catalfamo (both from Valguarnera, Sicily), Italian immigrants, in Melbourne on 1 November 1967. Giuseppe was a rural worker in Italy, and then a cane cutter in Cairns in 1955. By the following year he was a labourer in Melbourne and later worked for Victorian Railways. Arena grew up in Moonee Ponds with two sisters, Nancy and Silvana; her family calls her Pina which provided her stage name, Tina. For secondary schooling she attended St. Columba's College, Essendon from 1980 and completed Year&nbsp;12 in 1985.St Columba's College, Melbourne.  Retrieved on 13 December 2012. She later recalled her upbringing "It was a very Italian household, it was a very traditional household. There was a lot of love but there was a lot of discipline. And there was no room for pretentiousness. Really, there just wasn't." As a child Arena listened to Spanish, Italian and French songs that were in her family's record collection. At five she was the flower girl at her cousin Gaetano's wedding, and at the reception she urged her father to approach the host so that she could sing – Daryl Braithwaite's version of "You're My World" – it was her first public performance. She received singing lessons from Voila Ritchie who recommended her to appear on a TV talent quest and variety show, Young Talent Time. Initially appearing as a contestant Arena became Tiny Tina, a regular member of the show's Young Talent Team in 1976. For her first appearance she sang ABBA's "Ring Ring". As a member of the team Arena performed cover versions of popular tracks and in 1977 released a split album, Tiny Tina and Little John, alternating tracks with fellow team member, John Bowles. While with the TV series she appeared in TV specials, at shopping centres or tourist venues. In September 1982 she became a "coach" for new team members, Danielle Minogue and Mark McCormack; Arena told The Australian Women's Weeklys Debbie Byrne that "They seem to be settling down a lot quicker than I did. They both have a really professional attitude." At 14, she told Byrne "my aim: to be a recording artist and actress but, now, I have to concentrate simply on what I'm doing and that can take enough effort." Arena left the show in October 1983 ahead of her 16th birthday – the program's stipulation to give way for younger members – performing "The Way We Were" and "McArthur Park" for her finale. She completed her Higher School Certificate (final year of secondary school) and was hired as an insurance clerk but resigned after three months to pursue a music career. At the age of 17, Arena signed a record deal with Graffiti Records, which released her debut single, "Turn Up the Beat", in 1985. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described it as having a "dance-pop" style. The Sydney Morning Heralds Tim Elliott reflected that it "failed to impress." It had been recorded in the previous year with Brian Cadd producing at Flagstaff Studios in Melbourne. When the single did not appear in the top&nbsp;50 her planned album was scrapped. Arena sang advertisment jingles and worked on the pub and club circuit. She performed solo shows and in bands, including as a member of a nine-piece ensemble, Network. She also appeared in musicals. In 1987 she supported American artist, Lionel Richie on his Australian tour, following a number of charity performances. During 1988 Arena appeared as a guest on Australian TV shows recalling her tenure on Young Talent Time and looking for a new record label. In 1990 she had a singing and dancing role in the David Atkins' musical, Dynamite, for a 10-month run. Also that year she signed with EMI and reinvented her image as a raunchy disco diva. In May she issued a single,  "I Need Your Body", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the ARIA Singles Chart. McFarlane described it as "uptempo" with the associated music video "projecting a raunchy disco-diva persona... flaunting a pouting rock starlet with bouncing cleavage and attitude to burn." Australian journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, noticed that she used "raunchy videos showing off her cleavage as if to prove she was a woman now." The artist followed with another single, "The Machine's Breaking Down", in August 1990, which peaked in the top&nbsp;30. Her debut solo album, Strong as Steel, was released in October, which peaked at number&nbsp;17 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Most of the album was produced by Ross Inglis. Penelope Layland of The Canberra Times opined that "the frantic single, 'I Need Your Body', is quite uncharacteristic of much of the music on Tina Arena's album, Strong As Steel. In fact it is one of the weakest tracks on an album which bounces with potential pop hits." According to Nimmervoll, Arena "was not comfortable. This was not her. This was not what she wanted to be for the rest of her life. Tina went into seclusion while she decided what to do next, moving to Los Angeles to be a nobody again." She had relocated to LA in 1991 where she took more singing lessons and started song writing. Upon return to Australia, in 1993, she performed in the local musical theatre production, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, as the Narrator. Tina Arena's second solo studio album, Don't Ask, was released on 21 November 1994 and was produced by David Tyson for Columbia Records. According to Nimmervoll during recording "Tina nearly broke down. This was an all-important moment in her career." Arena co-wrote all ten tracks of the original Australian version.

The record is honest and sincere and simple." McFarlane noticed it demonstrated a "more mature, sophisticated, soul-tinged style and approach... [and] her powerful, crystal clear voice more than adequately matched the material on offer." Kelvin Hayes of AllMusic felt that "a lot of Don't Ask remains twee. However, there are good moments." It peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the ARIA Albums Chart – a year after its release – and remained in the top&nbsp;50 for 83&nbsp;weeks. It reached No.&nbsp;11 on the UK Albums Chart and No.&nbsp;12 in New Zealand. Don't Ask was the highest-selling album of 1995 in Australia and one of the biggest-selling albums by an Australian female singer to date. It has sold over two million copies worldwide and was certified 10&nbsp;times platinum by ARIA in 2011 for shipment of over 700,000 copies in that country alone. The success of the record made her a "priority artist" for Sony, who marketed her in the US. Her European success was realised: Don't Ask charted in Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. The lead single, "Chains", was issued ahead of the album in September 1994 in Australia, which peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It also reached No.&nbsp;6 in the UK, No.&nbsp;7 in New Zealand, No.&nbsp;9 in Ireland and No.&nbsp;20 in Canada. In 1995 she toured Europe, appearing on Top of the Pops, which broadcast to an audience of 60&nbsp;million people. In the European market Arena was an unknown and a fresh commodity, she opined: "I loved every minute of that – of people not knowing who I was. I guess it was tiring fighting the individual thing. It was good to not be a part of a past and being accepted as an artist. Not having to carry this Young Talent Time luggage which was constantly shoved in my face." Five additional singles were released, "Sorrento Moon (I Remember)" (February 1995), "Heaven Help My Heart" (May), "Wasn't It Good" (September), "Show Me Heaven" (November) and "That's the Way a Woman Feels" (March 1996). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 Arena was nominated in six categories and won four trophies: Best Pop Release and Song of the Year for "Chains"; and Album of the Year and Best Female Artist for Don't Ask.ARIA Music Awards for Tina Arena:  At the 1996 ceremony she received five more nominations and won Highest Selling Album for Don't Ask. Other accolades she earned were Variety Club Entertainer of the Year, an Advance Australia Foundation award, and a World Music Award. Arena relocated to Los Angeles in 1996 and 1997 to record her third solo studio album, In Deep (18 August 1997), which became her second number-one album in Australia. For the Australian version of the album Arena co-wrote eleven of its twelve tracks – her fellow writers include Mick Jones (of Foreigner), David Tyson, Christopher Ward, Dean McTaggart, Pam Reswick and Steve Werfel. The album included her cover version of Foreigner's "I Want to Know What Love Is", originally written by Jones who produced Arena's version. In Deep "was recorded predominantly live in the studio in an attempt to bring the material closer to Tina's stage performance persona" with four tracks produced by Tyson and the rest by Jones. In Deep was certified 3× platinum in Australia. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic found the US version of the album showed that "Her own songs, co-written with a team of others, are perfectly good contemporary pop/rock, and she sings them with passionate commitment" and it was "brimming with potential hit singles (it spawned three in Australia)." In Deep, in its different versions, provided ten singles, with the lead one, "Burn", appearing in July 1997, which had some US airplay. The track was co-written by Arena with Reswick and Werfel. In Australian it debuted at No.&nbsp;2 and was certified gold upon its release. It was also a hit in Asia. Besides the English language version she also recorded it in Spanish and Italian (in the form of "Ti Voglio Qui"). The second single, "If I Didn't Love You" (November) appeared in the ARIA top&nbsp;50. In April of the following year she issued "Now I Can Dance", which peaked at No.&nbsp;13. In the UK Arena released "Whistle Down the Wind" (June 1998) as a cover version single, it was the title track from the 1996 musical of the same name, her version reached the UK Singles Chart top&nbsp;30. Arena's duet with US artist, Marc Anthony, "I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You", from the feature film soundtrack for The Mask of Zorro (July 1998), gave her European chart success. The track was issued as a non-album single in Australia in September, but did not reached the top&nbsp;50. It was included on the French release version of In Deep, appearing in October, which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the French Albums Chart – a year after its first entry – and spent 88 weeks on that chart. It also reached the top&nbsp;10 in Belgium and top&nbsp;40 in Switzerland. It was certified 3× platinum by Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) in May 2001 for sales in France. "I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You" had been issued in Europe in September 1998, it peaked at No.&nbsp;3 in France – her first charting single in that market. It also reached No.&nbsp;3 in the Netherlands and top&nbsp;10 in Belgium. She toured the US from March 1999 to promote the album's local release, as well as another single, "If I Was a River", which did peak in the UK top&nbsp;40. Sony attempted to "break" Arena into the US market by the release of "If I Was a River", penned by Diane Warren. Ruhlmann felt the label had an "obvious plan is to turn her into a down-under Celine Dion" however the album and its singles "had no commercial impact upon release in the U.S." and "must be considered a disappointment." Her US foray included appearances on TV shows such as Donny & Marie. In February 1999 she teamed with label-mate Donna Summer to perform a cover version of "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)"; the duet appeared on Summer's live album, Live & More Encore (June 1999). Arena's first French language single, "Aller plus haut" (English: "Go Higher", July 1999), appeared on the continental version of In Deep, which peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the local singles chart; it has sold 600,000 copies in that country. It also became her first number-one hit on the Belgian Singles Chart. Her second French language single was a cover version of "Les trois cloches" (English: "The Three Bells", January 2000), which reached No.&nbsp;4 in France and another number-one hit in Belgium. From May that year she lived in London while she appeared in the lead role of Esméralda for the stage musical, Notre Dame de Paris during a six-month run. Carr, by now her ex-husband, had claimed in Business Review Weekly (2000) that Arena was paid $200,000 per week when she was performing in Notre Dame de Paris. Arena sang "The Flame" (written by John Foreman) at the 2000 Opening Ceremony of the Sydney Olympics on 15 September. Seven Network covered the national broadcast across Australia, which become the highest rating TV telecast in Australian history. John Farnham, Olivia Newton-John, Vanessa Amorosi, Human Nature and Julie Anthony were some of the other Australian artists who appeared at the opening ceremony and contributed to the various artists' album, The Games of the XXVII Olympiad: Official Music from the Opening Ceremony (September 2000). She recalled, "When I sang at the Olympics, I cared about the fact that I was Australian. And I was touched because I was an ethnic girl, of ethnic blood but that WAS Australian. Because I was born here, this is where I grew up, this is where I learned everything." At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000 in October the singer-songwriter received an Outstanding Achievement Award. In the following month she issued her first compilation album, Souvenirs, which reached the ARIA top&nbsp;40. Arena's fourth solo studio album, Just Me, was released on 12 November 2001 and debuted at No.&nbsp;7 in Australia; it reached the top&nbsp;50 in France and top&nbsp;70 in Switzerland. She co-wrote tracks with Nile Rodgers (Madonna, Diana Ross), Desmond Child (Ricky Martin, Aerosmith), Robbie Nevil (Earth, Wind & Fire), Mark Hudson (Eric Clapton, Cher), Victoria Shaw and Peter-John Vettese (Dido, Paul McCartney). The album explored different genres, containing more upbeat tracks as opposed to her two previous studio records which featured her soprano voice on slow pop ballads. Although written after the divorce from Carr, she said that the record is not angry nor bitter but rather a "celebration of womanhood". It was certified gold by ARIA and by SNEP (France). To promote Just Me she showcased it for 150 people, mostly Australian TV and media personalities, in Melbourne. The record provided four singles including, "Symphony of Life" (September 2002), which peaked at No.&nbsp;8 in Australia and top&nbsp;50 (as "Symphonie de l'âme") in France. In November 2008 she performed the track at the closing of the Gay Games, when the international sporting event was held in Sydney. She was featured on 2 (November 2002), a duets album from Olivia Newton-John for which the pair recorded an uptempo track, "I'll Come Runnin'". In March 2002 Arena posed for a semi-nude photo shoot by James Houston for Black+White magazine. She explained, "This shoot isn't about shock value, and it's not porn, it's an elegant, understated and honest exercise in challenging my sexuality and learning to love myself again." She appeared in Cabaret in August that year in Sydney in the lead role of Sally Bowles. In April 2003 Arena and US electronica group, Roc Project, released a dance music single "Never (Past Tense)", which reached No.&nbsp;1 on the US Billboard dance top&nbsp;10. The single included seven house and electronic dance music remixed versions by various DJs. This was the first time three performers associated with Young Talent Time were simultaneously in the chart's Top&nbsp;10 with Dannii Minogue's "I Begin to Wonder" and Kylie Minogue's "Slow" also appearing on the chart. "Never (Past Tense)" was used on the US TV series, Queer as Folk, and on its associated soundtrack album (2003). The singer-songwriter performed the Tiësto remix with a new remix of "Dare You to Be Happy" live at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras after party in March 2005. By 2014 she had performed at the Mardi Gras for a fourth time: she is one of the gay icons of this generation. In October 2004 Arena released Greatest Hits 1994–2004, her second compilation album, which peaked at No.&nbsp;10 in Australia. The compilation provided a newly recorded track as a single, "Italian Love Song" (November), which reached the top&nbsp;40. After its release she left the recording label, striking a new deal with Sony Music BMG, France. She embarked on an Australian national tour in late 2004 to early 2005 to support the album. Her debut French language album, Un autre univers was released in December 2005 and gained a platinum certificate from SNEP in February 2006, it reached No.&nbsp;9 on the French charts and remained for 78&nbsp;weeks. It provided a single, "Aimer jusqu'à l'impossible" which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the French charts and stayed in the top&nbsp;5 for over 10 weeks. The single peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in Belgium and was a top&nbsp;20 hit in Switzerland. The song received an award for Song of the Year in France. A second single "Je m'appelle Bagdad" was released in June 2006, peaking at No.&nbsp;6 in France and No.&nbsp;8 in Belgium. The third and final single from the album, "Tu aurais dû me dire (Oser parler d'amour)" (English: "You Should Have Told Me (Dare to Speak of Love)"), was issued in October.

Arena returned to the London stage in April 2007, starring as Roxie Hart in the West End production of Chicago. Her sixth studio album, Songs of Love & Loss, was recorded independently and self-financed as she no longer had a recording contract in Australia. It was issued on 1 December 2007 after a new deal was struck with EMI. It has torch songs, originally recorded by women in the 1960s and 1970s, including by Dusty Springfield and Diana Ross, and the arrangements featured a full string orchestra conducted by Simon Hale. A promotional tour of Australia, in early November, included appearances on Dancing with the Stars and Sunrise. Five concert dates backed by a 35-piece orchestra were held over December to January: three at the Sydney Opera House and two at Melbourne's Hamer Hall. The album peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the ARIA Albums Chart; at the ARIA Music Awards of 2008 it was nominated for Best Selling Album. While Arena was promoting Songs of Love & Loss in Australia, she shot a music video in and around Sydney for her next French language single, "Entends-tu le monde?" (English: "Do you hear the world?"), was made available to French radio and music TV channels. It appeared on her second French language album, 7 vies (28 January 2008), which debuted at No.&nbsp;12 on the official French charts, her highest debut in the country.

On 24 July 2011 Arena sang, in a remarkable a cappella performance, the Australian National Anthem on the podium on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées of the Tour de France after the victory by Australian cyclist, Cadel Evans.  This was unscheduled and came about because Arena was living in Paris at the time and offered her services only hours before the ceremony. It was the first time in Tour history that a national anthem was performed live on the podium in front of huge crowds and a broadcast audience of millions. In 2011 she was a judge on the French version of The Sing-Off.

After judging the talent shows, she finished her national Australian tour backed by various Australian symphony orchestras with Anthony Callea as a special guest. Arena detailed working on the tour: "They are precious, those moments where the orchestra swells behind you, they are difficult to describe in words and from an adrenalin perspective it is a sensational feeling." In November 2012 she issued her fourth live album released on CD and DVD, Symphony of Life, recorded at one of her Melbourne concerts. Arena's management is Beebox. Due to the success of her Symphony of Life Tour, Arena added five extra shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra for February and March 2013 as part of her Encore Concerts.
