    A lithium-ion battery (sometimes Li-ion battery or LIB) is a member of a family of rechargeable battery  types in which lithium ions move from the negative electrode to the positive electrode during discharge and back when charging. Li-ion batteries use an intercalated lithium compound as one electrode material, compared to the metallic lithium used in a non-rechargeable lithium battery. The electrolyte, which allows for ionic movement, and the two electrodes are the constituent components of a lithium-ion battery cell. Lithium-ion batteries are common in consumer electronics. They are one of the most popular types of rechargeable batteries for portable electronics, with a high energy density, small memory effect, and only a slow loss of charge when not in use. Beyond consumer electronics, LIBs are also growing in popularity for military, battery electric vehicle and aerospace applications. For example, lithium-ion batteries are becoming a common replacement for the lead acid batteries that have been used historically for golf carts and utility vehicles. Instead of heavy lead plates and acid electrolyte, the trend is to use lightweight lithium-ion battery packs that can provide the same voltage as lead-acid batteries, so no modification to the vehicle's drive system is required. Chemistry, performance, cost and safety characteristics vary across LIB types. Handheld electronics mostly use LIBs based on lithium cobalt oxide (), which offers high energy density, but presents safety risks, especially when damaged. Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), lithium manganese oxide (LMnO or LMO) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNiMnCoO2 or NMC) offer lower energy density, but longer lives and inherent safety. Such batteries are widely used for electric tools, medical equipment and other roles. NMC in particular is a leading contender for automotive applications. Lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (LiNiCoAlO2 or NCA) and lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12 or LTO) are specialty designs aimed at particular niche roles. The new lithium sulphur batteries promise the highest performance to weight ratio. Lithium-ion batteries can be dangerous under some conditions and can pose a safety hazard since they contain, unlike other rechargeable batteries, a flammable electrolyte and are also kept pressurized. Because of this the testing standards for these batteries are more stringent than those for acid-electrolyte batteries, requiring both a broader range of test conditions and additional battery-specific tests.Millsaps, C. (10 July 2012). Second Edition of IEC 62133: The Standard for Secondary Cells and Batteries Containing Alkaline or Other Non-Acid Electrolytes is in its Final Review Cycle. Retrieved from Battery Power Online (10 January 2014) This is in response to reported accidents and failures, and there have been battery-related recalls by some companies. Although the word "battery" is a common term to describe an electrochemical storage system, international industry standards differentiate between a "cell" and a "battery". A "cell" is a basic electrochemical unit that contains the basic components, such as electrodes, separator, and electrolyte. In the case of lithium-ion cells, this is the single cylindrical, prismatic or pouch unit, that provides an average potential difference at its terminals of 3.7 V for  and 3.3 V for . A "battery" or "battery pack" is a collection of cells or cell assemblies which are ready for use, as it contains an appropriate housing, electrical interconnections, and possibly electronics to control and protect the cells from failure. In this regard, the simplest "battery" is a single cell with perhaps a small electronic circuit for protection. In many cases, distinguishing between "cell" and "battery" is not important. However, this should be done when dealing with specific applications, for example, battery electric vehicles, where "battery" may indicate a high voltage system of 400 V, and not a single cell. The term "module" is often used as an intermediate topology, with the understanding that a battery pack is made of modules, and modules are composed of individual cells. Lithium batteries were proposed by M. S. Whittingham, now at Binghamton University, while working for Exxon in the 1970s. Whittingham used titanium(IV) sulfide and  as the electrodes. However, this rechargeable lithium battery could never be made practical. Titanium disulfide was a poor choice, since it has to be synthesized under completely sealed conditions. This is extremely expensive (~$1000 per kilo for titanium disulfide raw material in 1970s). When exposed to air, titanium disulphide reacts to form hydrogen sulphide compounds, which have an unpleasant odour. For this, and other reasons,  Exxon discontinued development of Whittingham's lithium-titanium disulfide battery. Batteries with metallic lithium electrodes presented safety issues, as lithium is a highly reactive element; it burns in normal atmospheric conditions because of the presence of water and oxygen.  As a result, research moved to develop batteries where, instead of metallic lithium, only lithium compounds are present, being capable of accepting and releasing lithium ions. Reversible intercalation in graphite and intercalation into cathodic oxides was discovered in the 1970s by J. O. Besenhard at TU Munich. Besenhard proposed its application in lithium cells. Electrolyte decomposition and solvent co-intercalation into graphite were severe early drawbacks for battery life. 1973 - Adam Heller Proposes the lithium thionyl chloride battery, still used in implanted medical devices and in defense systems where greater than a 20-year shelf life, high energy density, or extreme operating temperatures are encountered. 1977 – Samar Basu demonstrated electrochemical intercalation of lithium in graphite at the University of Pennsylvania. This led to the development of a workable lithium intercalated graphite electrode at Bell Labs () to provide an alternative to the lithium metal electrode battery. 1979 – At Oxford University, England, John Goodenough and Koichi Mizushima demonstrated a rechargeable cell with voltage in the 4 V range using lithium cobalt oxide () as the positive electrode and lithium metal as the negative electrode.{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0025-5408(80)90012-4| title = LixCoO2 (0<x<-1)</nowiki>: A new cathode material for batteries of high energy density| journal = Materials Research Bulletin| volume = 15| issue = 6| pages = 783–789| year = 1980| last1 = Mizushima | first1 = K.| last2 = Jones | first2 = P.

The lithium ions then migrate from the positive to the negative electrode, where they become embedded in the porous electrode material in a process known as [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]].  ===Procedure=== The charging procedures for single Li-ion cells, and complete Li-ion batteries, are slightly different. * A single Li-ion cell is charged in two stages:<ref name="Electronics lab" /> # [[Constant current]] (CC) # [[Voltage source]] (CV) * A Li-ion battery (a set of Li-ion cells in series) is charged in three stages: # [[Constant current]] # Balance (not required once a battery is balanced) # [[Voltage source]]  During the '''constant current''' phase, the charger applies a constant current to the battery at a steadily increasing voltage, until the voltage limit per cell is reached.  During the '''balance''' phase, the charger reduces the charging current (or cycle the charging on and off to reduce the average current) while the [[state of charge]] of individual cells is brought to the same level by a balancing circuit, until the battery is balanced. Some fast chargers skip this stage.  Some chargers accomplish the balance by charging each cell independently.  During the '''constant voltage''' phase, the charger applies a voltage equal to the maximum cell voltage times the number of cells in series to the battery, as the current gradually declines towards 0, until the current is below a set threshold of about 3% of initial constant charge current.  Periodic topping charge about once per 500 hours. Top charging is recommended to be initiated when voltage goes below {{nowrap|4.05 V/cell.}}  Failure to follow current and voltage limitations can result in an explosion.<ref name="illinois_charge">{{cite web|title=Design Review For: Advanced Electric Vehicle Battery Charger, ECE 445 Senior Design Project|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130504121516/http://courses.ece.illinois.edu/ece445/projects/fall2007/project10_design_review.doc|work=090521 courses.ece.illinois.edu}}</ref>  ===Extreme temperatures===  Charging temperature limits for Li-ion are stricter than the operating limits.

Eventually increasing resistance means that the battery can no longer operate for an adequate period.  Batteries with a lithium iron phosphate positive and graphite negative electrodes have a nominal open-circuit voltage of 3.2&nbsp;V and a typical charging voltage of 3.6&nbsp;V. Lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide positives with graphite negatives have a 3.7&nbsp;V nominal voltage with a 4.2&nbsp;V maximum while charging. The charging procedure is performed at constant voltage with current-limiting circuitry (i.e., charging with constant current until a voltage of 4.2&nbsp;V is reached in the cell and continuing with a constant voltage applied until the current drops close to zero). Typically, the charge is terminated at 3% of the initial charge current. In the past, lithium-ion batteries could not be fast-charged and needed at least two hours to fully charge. Current-generation cells can be fully charged in 45 minutes or less. In 2015 researchers demonstrated a small 600 mAh capacity battery charged to 68 percent capacity in two minutes and a 3,000 mAh battery charged to 48 percent capacity in five minutes.

Storage also reduces capacity.  Manufacturers' information typically specify lifespan in terms of the number of cycles (e.g., capacity dropping linearly to 80% over 500 cycles), with no mention of chronological age.<ref>[http://na.industrial.panasonic.com/sites/default/pidsa/files/uf103450pn_1.pdf Specification sheet for typical lithium-ion battery]. industrial.panasonic.com</ref> Research rejects this common industry practice.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  On average, lifetimes consist of 1000 cycles,<ref>{{cite web|title=How Lithium-ion Batteries Work |publisher= howstuffworks.com |url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/lithium-ion-battery3.htm}}</ref> although battery performance is rarely specified for more than 500 cycles.

When [[wikt:depleted|depleted]] below the protection circuit's low-voltage threshold (2.4 to 2.9 V/cell, depending on chemistry) the circuit disconnects and stops discharging until recharged. As discharge progresses, metallic cell contents plate onto its internal structure, creating an unwanted discharge path.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  ===Variability=== A 2015 study by Andreas Gutsch of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] found that lithium-ion battery storage lifetime could vary by a factor of five, with some Li-ion cells losing 30% of their capacity after 1,000 cycles, and others having better capacity after 5,000 cycles. Specific manufacturers were not named, but in general the performance of cells from Japan and Germany was best, followed by South Korea and the US, with cells from China performing worst.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2015/03/27/battery-storage-test-shows-lithium-ion-cells-last-5x-longer/|title=Battery Tests Show Some Lithium-Ion Cells Last Over 5x Longer|work=CleanTechnica}}</ref> The study also found that safety standards for some batteries were not met. For stationary energy storage it was estimated that batteries with lifespans of at least 3,000 cycles were needed for profitable operation.  === Degradation === Over their lifespan, batteries degrade progressively with reduced capacity, cycle life, and safety due to chemical changes to the electrodes. Capacity loss/fade is expressed as a percentage of initial capacity after a number of cycles (e.g., 30% loss after 1,000 cycles). Fade can be separated into calendar loss and cycling loss. Calendar loss results from the passage of time and is measured from the maximum state of charge. Cycling loss is due to usage and depends on both the maximum state of charge and the depth of discharge.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.112| title = Temperature dependent ageing mechanisms in Lithium-ion batteries – A Post-Mortem study| journal = Journal of Power Sources| volume = 262| pages = 129–135| year = 2014| last1 = Waldmann | first1 = T. | last2 = Wilka | first2 = M. | last3 = Kasper | first3 = M. | last4 = Fleischhammer | first4 = M. | last5 = Wohlfahrt-Mehrens | first5 = M. }}</ref>  Degradation is strongly temperature-dependent; increasing if stored or used at higher temperatures.

The layer is composed of electrolyte—carbonate reduction products that serve both as an ionic conductor and electronic insulator. It forms on both the anode and cathode and determines many performance parameters. Under typical conditions, such as room temperature and the absence of charge effects and contaminants, after the first charge the layer reaches a fixed thickness, allowing the device can operate for years. However, operation outside such parameters can degrade the device via several reactions.<ref name=":0" />  ==== Reactions ==== Five common exothermic degradation reactions can occur:<ref name=":0" /> * Chemical reduction of the electrolyte by the anode. * Thermal decomposition of the electrolyte. * Chemical oxidation of the electrolyte by the cathode. * Thermal decomposition by the cathode and anode. * Internal short circuit by charge effects.  ===== Anode ===== The SEI layer that forms on the anode is a mixture of lithium oxide, [[lithium fluoride]] and semicarbonates (e.g., lithium alkyl carbonates).  At elevated temperatures, alkyl carbonates on the electrolyte decompose into insoluble [[Li2CO3|Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]]&nbsp;that can increase film thickness, clogging carbon surface pores and limiting ion anode access. This increases impedance and reduces capacity. Gases formed by electrolyte decomposition increase the cell's internal pressure and are a potential safety issue in demanding environments such as mobile devices.<ref name=":0" />  Extended storage can trigger an incremental increase in film thickness and capacity fade.<ref name=":0" />  Charging at greater than 4.2 V can initiate Li<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;plating on the anode, producing irreversible capacity fade. The randomness of the metallic lithium embedded in the anode during intercalation results in [[dendrites]] formation. Over time the dendrites can accumulate and pierce the separator, causing a [[short circuit]] leading to heat, fire and/or explosion. This process is referred to as [[thermal runaway]].<ref name=":0" />  Discharging beyond 2 V can also result in capacity fade. The (copper) anode current collector can dissolve into the electrolyte. When charged, copper ions can reduce on the anode as metallic copper. Over time, copper dendrites can form and cause a short in the same manner as lithium.<ref name=":0" />  High cycling rates and state of charge induces mechanical strain on the anode's graphite lattice. Mechanical strain caused by intercalation and de-intercalation creates fissures and splits of the graphite particles, changing their orientation. This orientation change results in capacity fade.<ref name=":0" />  There is a historical note about the terminology of Anode when referring to Lithium cells, which started as Primary (single discharge) as exampled with Lithium Thionyl Chloride cells.  The Anode is classically the electrode where Oxidation is taking place in electrochemistry. This is true on discharge but with a rechargeable system the electrode switches back and forth from anode to cathode with cycling. The less ambiguous term for secondary cells electrodes are Positive ( anode on charge, not discharge) and Negative. This is the polarity measured on any cell with a volt meter.<ref name=":0" />  ==== Electrolytes ==== Electrolyte degradation mechanisms include hydrolysis and thermal decomposition.<ref name=":0" />  At concentrations as low as 10 ppm, water begins catalyzing a host of degradation products that can affect the electrolyte, anode and cathode.<ref name=":0" /> LiPF<sub>6 </sub>participates in an equilibrium reaction with LiF and PF<sub>5</sub>. Under typical conditions, the equilibrium lies far to the left. However the presence of water generates substantial LiF, an insoluble, electronically insulating product. LiF binds to the anode surface, increasing film thickness.<ref name=":0" />  LiPF<sub>6</sub> hydrolysis yields PF<sub>5</sub>, a strong [[Lewis acid]] that reacts with electron-rich species, such as water. PF<sub>5</sub> reacts with water to form [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) and [[phosphorus oxyfluoride]]. Phosphorus oxyfluoride in turn reacts to form additional HF and difluorohydroxy [[phosphoric acid]]. HF converts the rigid SEI film into a fragile one. On the cathode, the carbonate solvent can then diffuse onto the cathode oxide over time, releasing heat and thermal runaway.<ref name=":0" />  Decomposition of electrolyte salts and interactions between the salts and solvent start at as low as 70 C. Significant decomposition occurs at higher temperatures. At 85 C [[transesterification]] products, such as dimethyl-2,5-dioxahexane carboxylate (DMDOHC)  are formed from EC reacting with DMC.<ref name=":0" />  ==== Cathode ==== [[Lithium cobalt oxide]] (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) is the most widely used cathode material. Lithium manganese oxide (LiMnO<sub>4</sub>) is a potential alternative because of its low cost and ease of preparation, but its relatively poor cycling and storage capabilities has prevented it from commercial acceptance.<ref name=":0" />  Cathode degradation mechanisms include manganese dissolution, electrolyte oxidation and structural disorder.<ref name=":0" />  In LiMnO<sub>4</sub> hydrofluoric acid catalyzes the loss of metallic manganese through disproportionation of trivalent manganese:<ref name=":0" />                  2Mn<sup>3+</sup> → Mn<sup>2+</sup>+ Mn<sup>4+</sup>  Material loss of the spinel results in capacity fade. Temperatures as low as 50 C initiate Mn<sup>2+ </sup>deposition on the anode as metallic manganese with the same effects as lithium and copper plating. Cycling over the theoretical max and min voltage plateaus destroys the [[crystal lattice]] via [[Jahn-Teller distortion]], which occurs when Mn<sup>4+</sup> is reduced to Mn<sup>3+</sup> during discharge.<ref name=":0" />  Storage of a battery charged to greater than 3.6 V initiates electrolyte oxidation by the cathode and induces SEI layer formation on the cathode. As with the anode, excessive SEI formation forms an insulator resulting in capacity fade and uneven current distribution.<ref name=":0" />  Storage at less than 2 V results in the slow degradation of LiCoO<sub>2</sub> and LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> cathodes, the release of oxygen and irreversible capacity loss.<ref name=":0" />  ===Conditioning === The need to "condition" [[NiCd]] and [[NiMH]] batteries has leaked into folklore surrounding Li-ion batteries. The recommendation for the older technologies is to leave the device plugged in for seven or eight hours, even if fully charged.<ref>[http://dottech.org/17705/tip-condition-your-new-cell-phones-battery-to-make-it-last-longer-but-be-sure-to-condition-it-properly/ Tip: Condition your new cell phone’s battery to make it last longer (but be sure to condition it properly)].

This significantly improves battery efficiency and increases capacity. As the number of cells and load currents increase, the potential for mismatch increases. The two kinds of mismatch are state-of-charge (SOC) and capacity/energy ("C/E"). Though SOC is more common, each problem limits pack charge capacity (mA·h) to that of the weakest cell.  ==Safety== {{See also|Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents|Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery problems}} If overheated or overcharged, Li-ion batteries may suffer [[thermal runaway]] and cell rupture.<ref name="Spotnitz:2003a">{{Cite journal | last1 = Spotnitz | first1 = R. | last2 = Franklin | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00488-3 | title = Abuse behavior of high-power, lithium-ion cells | journal = Journal of Power Sources | volume = 113 | pages = 81–100 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref><ref name= "Finegan:2015">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncomms7924| title = In-operando high-speed tomography of lithium-ion batteries during thermal runaway| journal = Nature Communications| volume = 6| pages = 6924| year = 2015| last1 = Finegan | first1 = D.
