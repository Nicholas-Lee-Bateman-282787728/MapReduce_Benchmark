 St. George is a city located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Utah and is the county seat of Washington County, Utah. It is the principal city of the St. George Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city lies in the northeastern-most part of the Mojave Desert adjacent to Pine Valley Mountains, it's also at the convergence of three distinct geological areas; the Mojave Desert, Colorado Plateau, and Great Basin. It is 118 miles northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada and south-southwest of Salt Lake City along Interstate 15. The city is named after George A. Smith, a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Apostle. As of 2014, St. George had a population of 78,505. In 2005, St. George was the second fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, only after Greeley, Colorado, a trend that continued through 2010, when growth slowed substantially due to the economic recession. In 2014, the St. George metropolitan area (defined as Washington County) had an estimated 151,948 residents. Utah's Dixie is a nickname given to the area when Mormon pioneers grew cotton in the warm climate of Utah's southern-most end. St. George is the seventh-largest city in Utah and the most populous city in the state outside of the Wasatch Front.  Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the St. George area was inhabited by the Virgin River Anasazi and later by the Paiute tribe. The first Europeans in the area were part of the Dominguez–Escalante Expedition in 1776. St. George was founded as a cotton mission in 1861 under the direction of Apostle Erastus Snow which was called Dixie by Brigham Young, who was then the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While early settlers did manage to grow cotton, it was never produced at competitive market rates; consequently, cotton farming was eventually abandoned and replaced by a tourist based economy as the railroads developed bringing visitors to the nearest National Park which is Zion National Park. At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Brigham Young organized the settlement of what is now Washington County, Utah. Fearing that the war would take away the cotton supply, he began plans for raising enough in this southwestern country to supply the needs of his people. Enough favorable reports had come to him from this warm region below the rim of the Great Basin, that he was convinced cotton could be raised successfully here. At the general church conference in Salt Lake City on October 6th, 1861, about three hundred families were "called" to the Dixie mission to promote the cotton industry.  Most of the people knew nothing of this expedition until their names were read from the pulpit; but in nearly every case, they responded with good will, and made ready to leave within the month’s time allotted to them. The families were selected so as to ensure the communities the right number of farmers, masons, blacksmiths, businessmen, educators, carpenters, as needed.Under Dixie Sun, 1950, Washington County Chapter, Daughters Utah Pioneers, pp 293–294.  Printed by Garfield County News, Panguitch Utah. The settlement was named after George A. Smith, an apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Lynn Arave, "St. George likely named after an LDS apostle", Deseret Morning News, July 8, 2007. In April 1877, the LDS Church completed the St George, Utah Temple. It is the Church's third temple, and it is the longest continually operating temple in southern Utah. St.  George was the location of the 1997 United States Academic Decathlon national finals and more recently, in January 2005 a 100-year flood occurred throughout the region due to prolonged heavy rainfall overflowing the Virgin River and Santa Clara River (Utah). One person was killed and twenty-eight  homes were destroyed by the raging Santa Clara River. St. George received the brunt of the fallout of above-ground nuclear testing in the Yucca Flats/Nevada Test Site northwest of Las Vegas in the early 1940s. Winds routinely carried the fallout of these tests directly through the St. George and southern Utah area. Marked increases in cancer not limited to leukemia, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, bone cancer, brain tumors, and gastrointestinal tract cancers were reported from the mid-1950s and still continue today.Falk, Jim (1982). Gobal Fission:The Battle Over Nuclear Power, p. 134. A 1962 United States Atomic Energy Commission report found that children living in St. George, Utah at the time of the fall-out may have received doses to the thyroid of radioiodine as high as 120 to 440 rads" (1.2 to 4.4 Gy).Pat Ortmeyer and Arjun Makhijani. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, November/December 1997, via October 31, 2007 retrival.   According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 64.9&nbsp;square miles (168.0&nbsp;km²), of which, 64.4&nbsp;square miles (166.8&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.5&nbsp;square miles (1.2&nbsp;km²) of it (0.72%) is water. St. George lies in a desert valley with most of the city lying below 3,000 feet (900 m). Wildlife and vegetation are typical of the Mojave Desert in which it lies. It is situated near a unique geological transition zone where the Mojave, Colorado Plateau and Great Basin all converge. The Beaver Dam Mountains, commonly referred to as Utah Hill, lie to the west, the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area and Pine Valley Mountains to the north, the western edge of the Colorado Plateau and Zion National Park to the east, and the Arizona Strip to the south. The urban area sprawls around numerous hills, mesas, waterways and natural habitat reserves, appearing much differently than in its early days in history when the town was tucked below the red sandstone bluffs between the two black volcanic ridges. The city is bordered by Washington to the east and Santa Clara and Ivins to the west-northwest. The community of Bloomington forms the southwestern part of the city. As the city expanded, so did the network of roads and highways, and with all the ridges and rugged terrain of the valley, it made for a challenge, especially for east-west oriented travel. When the grid was originally plotted, the streets were built unusually wide so horse wagons could easily make U-turns and park with ample space. The downtown area is generally defined as being the central valley between the Black Hill on the west, the red sandstone bluff or Red Hill to the north, and Foremaster Ridge on the east and the Virgin River to the south. Interstate 15 cuts nearly through the center, severing many surface and residential streets of the grid. The major roads, St. George Boulevard, Bluff Street and Dixie Drive are the main downtown area interchanges, and are part of the Interstate 15 business loop, however, Dixie Drive serves as the major thoroughfare connecting downtown and I-15 with the west side of the valley. Interestingly, there is not one of the city's main roadways that actually runs unobstructed from one end of the city to the other. The old part of downtown has a well defined grid of broad, tree-lined avenues, with the center point being at the intersection of Tabernacle and Main Streets. All streets parallel to Tabernacle run east-west and all streets parallel to Main run north-south. The downtown area is home to the city's historic district with many preserved pioneer-era homes and storefronts registered on the national historic list, as well as the campus of Dixie State University and many of the city's office, retail, health and religious centers. Both the city's east and west sides are predominantly typical suburban neighborhoods dotted with neighborhood strip malls and commercial centers, however the east side and along the River Road corridor boasts the majority of the area's shopping centers and industrial parks. Much of the city's more exclusive, high-end neighborhoods lie among the elevated hills and mesas throughout. Most of the remaining agricultural areas exist primarily in the outlying south and southeastern parts of the city, such as Little Valley, where residents are striving to preserve one of the city's last remaining rural-lifestyle areas. Dixie Downs is a neighborhood in the northwest part of town and is named for an old horse race track that once existed near the present-day intersection of Dixie Downs Road and Snow Canyon Parkway. Dixie Downs is notable for being the most ethnically diverse neighborhood in the city and is home to the first dual-language immersion public school in the Washington County School District.  In southwestern Utah, soil and rock formations are red in appearance due to the presence of iron oxide, although portions of the older section of the city, particularly the southern part near the Virgin River, lie on floodplain alluvium, but much of St. George proper is built directly upon Jurassic, Triassic, and Permian period sedimentary bedrock. The following formations are listed in chronological order and can be found within the city limits. Kaibab Limestone (Permian): Grey fossiliferious limestone, exposed at the center of the Virgin River anticline along Horseman Park Drive and in the low hills to the south of South Bloomington Hills. Moenkopi Formation (Triassic): Chocolatey-red and white banded mudstone, shale, limestone, and siltstone containing thick layers of gypsum, exposed at Bloomington, South Bloomington Hills, and the south side of Webb Hill. Shinarump Conglomerate (Triassic): Yellow to brown cliff-forming sandstone and conglomerate containing fossilized oyster shells and petrified wood.  Forms the cliff faces north of Bloomington, on Webb Hill, and along the Virgin River south of 1450 South Street. This is actually the lowest member of the Chinle formation. Chinle Formation (Triassic): Purple, white, grey and locally green bentonitic shale weathering to clay. Because of the softness of the strata, structures built on this formation run a higher risk of settling or slippage. The Chinle formation underlies large portions of St. George, including North Bloomington Hills, much of Green Valley, and much of the east side of the city around Riverside Drive and Pine View High School. Moenave Formation (Jurassic): Red and orange sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone.  There is some confusion about distinguishing between the Springdale sandstone member of the Moenave formation and the overlying Navajo sandstone, which is similar in appearance, in the St. George area.  It is now generally assumed that the red cliffs north of downtown (north of Red Hills Parkway) and at the Dixie Red Hills golf course are part of the Moenave formation.  Other exposures include cuts into the east and west Black Hills and the southern part of the Dixie Downs neighborhood. Kayenta Formation (Jurassic): Red, orange, and purple sandstone, shale, and mudstone.  Forms slopes below the massive Navajo sandstone in the northern part of the city including northern Dixie Downs and along Snow Canyon Parkway. Navajo Sandstone (Jurassic): Grey to brown, red, and (in its upper layers) white massive sandstone. Forms cliff faces above Snow Canyon Parkway and white outcrops at Winchester Hills. Basaltic lava flows from the Quaternary period form the black ridges to the east and west of the old part of St. George city.  The volcanic eruptions producing these flows are thought to date back 1.2 million years. Other points of geologic interest include the Virgin River anticline; the rock has eroded away in the center leaving sheer walls surrounding the "Purgatory Flats" area to the east of St. George. Another geologic feature is Pine Valley Mountain, composed of one solid piece of granite, it is one of the largest laccoliths in the world. St. George's climate is significantly warmer on average than the rest of Utah, and typical of the desert southwest, with an arid desert climate (Köppen BWks or BWhs), features long, hot summers and brief, cool winters. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 41.3° in December to 87.9° in July, while there are 60 days with 100°+ highs with an average window of June 29 thru August 13, and 122 days with 90° with the average window fluctuating between late April and early October, and approximately 61 days where the low reaches freezing with the historical average window between November 12 and March 14, however, commonly the first freeze occurs in early December. The highest temperature statewide was 118&nbsp;°F which was recorded in a remote area south of St. George proper, near the Arizona border on July 4, 2007, breaking the previous record-holder, in St. George itself, at 117° set on July 5, 1985.  The record high minimum temperature is 89° set on July 15, 1970, and July 3, 2013. Nighttime freezes are common during the winter due to radiative cooling. Both the record low temperature of −11&nbsp;°F and record low maximum temperature of 17&nbsp;°F were set on January 22, 1937; the record low temperature occurred again on January 26, 1937. The city has abundant sunshine year-round and averages of over 300 sunny days per year with 8.80 of precipitation annually. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, except a dry period from late April through June which occurred after the pacific storm season but before the southwest monsoon. Precipitation mostly comes from the Pacific Ocean from late fall through early spring. The storm track usually lifts north of the city by mid-April. The North American Monsoon brings localized and  intense thunderstorms mid-July through mid-September. The greatest rainfall in 24-hours was 2.40 inches and was on August 31, 1909. Snowfall is rare in the city with many seasons recording no measurable accumulation; the normal seasonal snowfall is 1.4 inches.  The earliest snowfall was measured on October 29, 1971 and the latest on April 11, 1927. The record single day snowfall is 10.0 inches which was set on January 5, 1974.
