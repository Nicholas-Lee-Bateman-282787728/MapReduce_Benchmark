 Kansas is an American rock band that became popular in the 1970s initially on album-oriented rock charts and later with hit singles such as "Carry On Wayward Son" and "Dust in the Wind". The band has produced eight gold albums, three sextuple-platinum albums (Leftoverture, Point of Know Return, The Best of Kansas), one platinum live album (Two for the Show) and a million-selling single, "Dust in the Wind". Kansas appeared on the Billboard charts for over 200 weeks throughout the 1970s and 1980s and played to sold-out arenas and stadiums throughout North America, Europe and Japan. "Carry On Wayward Son" was the second-most-played track on classic rock radio in 1995 and No. 1 in 1997. In 1969, Lynn Meredith, Don Montre, Dan Wright and Kerry Livgren (guitars, keyboards, synthesizers) were performing in a band called The Reasons Why in their hometown of Topeka, Kansas. After changing the band's name to Saratoga, they started playing Livgren's original material with Scott Kessler playing bass and Zeke Lowe on drums. In 1970, they changed the band's name to Kansas and merged with members of rival Topeka progressive rock group White Clover. White Clover members Dave Hope (bass) and Phil Ehart (drums, percussion) joined with Livgren, vocalists Meredith and Joel Warne, keyboardists Montre and Wright and saxophonist Larry Baker.  This early Kansas group, which lasted until 1971 when Ehart, Hope and some of the others left to reform White Clover, is sometimes referred to as Kansas I. Ehart was replaced by Zeke Lowe and later Brad Schulz, Hope was replaced by Rod Mikinski on bass, and Baker was replaced by John Bolton on saxophone and flute. (This lineup is sometimes referred to as Kansas II, and 30 years later would re-form under the name Proto-Kaw.) In 1972, after Ehart returned from England (where he had gone to look for other musicians), he and Hope once again reformed White Clover with Robby Steinhardt (vocals, violin, viola, cello), Steve Walsh (vocals, keyboards, synthesizers, percussion) and Rich Williams (guitars). In 1973 they recruited Livgren from the second Kansas group, which then folded.Rock Movers & Shakers by Dafydd Rees & Luke Crampton, 1991 Billboard Books. Eventually they received a recording contract with Don Kirshner's eponymous label and decided to adopt the Kansas name. Their self-titled debut album was released in March 1974, nearly a year after it was recorded in New York. It defined the band's signature sound, a mix of American-style boogie rock and complex, symphonic arrangements with changing time signatures. Steinhardt's violin was a distinctive element of the group's sound, being defined more by heartland rock than the jazz and classic influences which most progressive rock violinists followed. The band slowly developed a cult following, due to promotion by Kirshner and extensive touring for the debut album and its two follow-ups, Song for America and Masque. Kansas released its fourth album, Leftoverture, in October 1976, which produced a hit single, "Carry On Wayward Son", in 1977. The follow-up, Point of Know Return, released in October 1977, featured the title track and "Dust in the Wind," both hit singles. Leftoverture was a breakthrough for the band, hitting No. 5 on Billboard's pop album chart. ''Point of Know Return'' peaked even higher, at No. 4. ''Leftoverture'' and ''Point'' each sold over four million copies in the U.S. Both "Carry On Wayward Son" and "Dust in the Wind" were certified [[music recording sales certification|gold singles]], selling over one million units each. "Dust in the Wind" was certified gold as a digital download by the [[RIAA]] in 2005, almost 30 years after selling one million copies as a single. ''Leftoverture'' was eventually certified five-times platinum by the RIAA in 2001.  During this period, Kansas became a major headlining act and sold out the largest venues available to rock bands at the time, including [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]]. The band documented this era in 1978 with ''[[Two for the Show (Kansas album)|Two for the Show]]'', a [[double album|double]] [[live album]] of recordings from various performances from its 1977 and 1978 tours. The band gained a solid reputation for faithful live reproduction of their studio recordings. In 1978 the band was named [[UNICEF]] Deputy [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador|Ambassadors of Goodwill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nehrecords.com/shop/KansasPoint.html |title=Kansas - Point Of No Return |publisher=Nehrecords.com |date=1978-06-27 |accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref>  The follow-up studio album to ''Point of Know Return'' was ''[[Monolith (Kansas album)|Monolith]]'' (1979), which, like the live album, was self-produced. The album generated a [[Top 40]] single in "[[People of the South Wind]]", whose title refers to the meaning of the 'Kanza' ([[Kaw people|Kaw]]) Native American people, after whom the state and the band are named. The album failed to garner the sales and radio airplay of its two predecessors. Nevertheless, the album eventually went platinum. Livgren's platinum award for the album is on display at the Kansas History Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/cool3/record.htm |title=Cool Things, Kansas Platinum Record, Kansas Historical Society |publisher=Kshs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref>  ===1980–84: Creative tensions=== Kansas' band members began to drift apart in the early 1980s. Livgren became a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]], and this was reflected in his lyrics on the next three albums, beginning with ''[[Audio-Visions]].'' "[[Hold On (Kansas song)|Hold On]]," a Top 40 single from that album, displayed his new-found faith. Hope soon converted to Christianity as well. This would be the final album with the original lineup (until they reunited in 2000), and also the last Kansas studio album to be certified gold by the RIAA.  Due to creative differences over the lyrical direction of the next album, Walsh left in October 1981 to form a new band, [[Streets (band)|Streets]]. In early 1982, Walsh was replaced by vocalist/keyboardist [[John Elefante]],<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> who—unknown to Livgren and Hope at the time—was also a Christian.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Bruce|title=Elefante Interview|url=http://www.progrock.org/elefante/interview2.html|publisher=progrock.org|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref> He was chosen from over 200 applicants, such as [[Sammy Hagar]] and [[Doug Pinnick]]. Kansas' first album with Elefante, ''[[Vinyl Confessions]]'', was released in June 1982. The record renewed interest in the group and generated the band's first Top 20 hit in several years, "[[Play the Game Tonight]]," which hit number 4 on Billboard's newly deployed Mainstream Rock chart. The album's mostly Christianity-based lyrics attracted a new audience. Still, sales of the album fell short of gold status.  ''[[Drastic Measures]]'' followed in 1983. For various reasons, Livgren contributed only three songs to the album. The rest were penned by the Elefante brothers (who later became successful producers for [[contemporary Christian music]] artists, including [[Sweet Comfort Band]], [[Petra (band)|Petra]], [[Bride (band)|Bride]], [[Rick Cua]], and [[Guardian (band)|Guardian]]). With violinist Steinhardt leaving the group before the recording sessions, the result was a more mainstream pop-rock album. Though the album charted lower than any Kansas album since ''Masque'', peaking at number 41, its single "[[Fight Fire With Fire (Kansas song)|Fight Fire with Fire]]" fared better. It did not crack the Top 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], but reached No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock chart. It was the highest chart position of any Kansas release on any chart, though this particular chart did not exist prior to 1981.  During the band's time with Elefante as lead vocalist, Livgren became increasingly uncomfortable with Kansas representing his Christian worldview. After a final New Year's Eve performance on December 31, 1983, Livgren and Hope left to form [[AD (band)|AD]] with former [[Bloodrock]] member [[Warren Ham]], who had toured as a sideman with Kansas in 1982, and [[Michael Gleason]], who had done the same in 1983. They were joined by drummer Dennis Holt. Elefante, Ehart, and Williams sought to continue as Kansas, and recorded one more song, "Perfect Lover," which appeared on the retrospective ''[[The Best of Kansas]]'' (1984), which has sold over 4 million units in the U.S. alone. The song would eventually be removed in favor of other songs on the remastered release of the compilation. The group disbanded after its release, which thus became the final Kansas recording with Elefante. Since leaving Kansas, Elefante has become a popular CCM artist, and has not performed with the group since.  ===1985–90: Reformation=== [[File:SteveMorse.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Kansas guitarist [[Steve Morse]]]] In 1985 the band came back together with Walsh, but without Livgren, Hope or Steinhardt.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> The new line-up included bassist [[Billy Greer]] (of [[Streets (band)|Streets]]) and guitarist [[Steve Morse]] (formerly of the [[Dixie Dregs]]). The re-formed band released ''[[Power (Kansas album)|Power]]'' in November 1986. The first single, "[[All I Wanted (Kansas song)|All I Wanted]]," became the last Kansas single to hit the ''Billboard'' Top 40 chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;19.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> It also received considerable airplay on MTV.  Two more singles, the title track and "Can't Cry Anymore," were less successful, "Power" hitting the lower end of the Top 100 and getting substantial play and charting on the Rock Charts, but "Can't Cry Anymore" receiving little airplay despite a clever video.  The new lineup released a second album, ''[[In the Spirit of Things]],'' in 1988. The concept album and subsequent tour were popular with the fan base but did not receive widespread airplay beyond the "Stand Beside Me" video on MTV. Morse temporarily left the band at the end of the tour in 1989.  In November 1990, a German promoter arranged to reunite all the original members of Kansas (except for Steinhardt) for a European tour. Greer joined them, along with keyboardist Greg Robert, who had first joined Kansas on tour in 1986. At the end of the tour, Hope left again, but Livgren remained on into 1991.  ===1991–97: Addition of David Ragsdale=== In 1991, violinist [[David Ragsdale]] joined the group and the return of the violin allowed Kansas to perform earlier material in arrangements closer to the originals. Livgren left during the 1991 summer tour, to be replaced temporarily by Steve Morse again. After the tour, Morse left the band for good to return to his own projects and eventually become a member of [[Deep Purple]], and Ragsdale took over the extra guitar parts, leaving Williams as the primary guitar player. The resulting lineup of Ehart, Greer, Ragsdale, Robert, Walsh, and Williams lasted from 1991 to 1997.  This period saw one live album and accompanying video, ''[[Live at the Whisky]]'' (1992) and one studio album ''[[Freaks of Nature (Kansas album)|Freaks of Nature]]'' (1995). On July 28, 1996, Kansas was inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame in Hollywood. [[File:Kansas band 6-6-09.jpg|thumb|right|Kansas, June 6, 2009]] In early 1997, Robert and Ragsdale left the band and Steinhardt returned.  ===1997–2006: Return of Robby Steinhardt=== In 1998, Kansas released ''[[Always Never the Same (Kansas album)|Always Never the Same]],'' which featured Larry Baird conducting the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. The album was a mix of older Kansas material (with new arrangements by Baird), several new songs, and a [[cover version|cover]] of "[[Eleanor Rigby]]". ''[[Somewhere to Elsewhere]],'' a new studio album released in July 2000, featured all the original members of Kansas, plus Greer, with all songs written by Livgren.  During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Livgren would occasionally attend Kansas shows and come on stage to play one or more songs with the band. At a March 9, 2002 concert at [[Lake Tahoe]], he played the whole show, subbing for Rich Williams, who was "under the weather."   In 2000, Kansas was the opening act for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] during their "Masterworks" tour. In 2002, Kansas II (the lineup prior to the recording and release of Kansas' first album) released an album under the group name [[Proto-Kaw]], featuring demos and live material recorded from 1971 to 1973. This led to a new studio album, ''[[Before Became After]]'' (2004), with most of the Kansas II members participating. Proto-Kaw released a third album, ''[[The Wait of Glory]],'' in 2006.[[File:Kansas Full 2.JPG|thumb|right|Kansas performing in 2008]]  The year 2002 brought another live album and [[DVD]], entitled ''[[Device - Voice - Drum]]'', which was recorded in the band's present home of [[Atlanta]] on June 15 of that year.  ===2006–14: Continued touring and regained popularity=== Kansas has continued to tour every year. The 2006 tour was delayed for a few weeks due to Steinhardt's second departure,<ref>[http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/Interviews06/Phil%20Ehart.htm] {{wayback|url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/Interviews06/Phil%20Ehart.htm |date=20150402123159 }}</ref> and Ragsdale subsequently returned to the lineup. In 2008, the Kansas website announced that four of the five current members (Ehart, Ragsdale, Williams and Greer) had formed a recording group called [[Native Window]], and they released their self-titled debut album in June 2009.  In February 2009, Kansas recorded a concert in Topeka, Kansas featuring a full symphony orchestra, with Larry Baird conducting. Morse and Livgren appeared as special guests on several songs. The performance was released on CD, DVD and Blu-ray and the DVD hit No.&nbsp;5 on the ''Billboard'' Music Video Chart the week after its release.  As of July 13, 2010, Kansas had recently completed a 30-day "United We Rock" tour with fellow classic rock acts [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]].  Kansas began a collegiate tour in September 2010. On this tour, they performed with the symphony orchestras of various U.S. colleges in an effort to raise money for the individual schools' music programs. The success of the tour led the band to start [[2011 Collegiate Symphony Tour|another one]] the following year.  [[File:David Ragsdale and Billy Greer 2.JPG|thumb|right| David Ragsdale (l.) and Billy Greer on stage with Kansas in 2010]]  On September 13, 2012, Kansas began a [[Fall 2012 Tour (Kansas)|new tour]] with a performance at the Best Buy Theater in New York City.  Opening for them was the band [[King's X]] and a one-man-band called [[That 1 Guy]].  This tour featured many hits from the albums Leftoverture and Point of Know Return, as well as material from a number of their other albums.  The band kicked off 2013 being featured on the Rock Legends II cruise. The floating rock festival for a cause aboard Royal Caribbean International’s Liberty of the Seas, departed January 10, 2013 from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Other big names included [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Paul Rodgers]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]], [[Bachman & Turner]], [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[Foghat]], and [[Molly Hatchet]].  On March 1, 2013, Kansas announced a 40th anniversary celebration was in the works. "Celebrating 40 years as a band, legendary American Progressive Rock Band Kansas is taking a break from their regular touring schedule to say 'thank you' to their legions of loyal 'Wheatheads' with a once-in-a-lifetime fan appreciation concert scheduled for August 17, 2013 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania." their press release read.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  The statement continued, "To start the concert Kansas will perform a set backed by a 35-piece symphony orchestra. Following an intermission, Kansas will then rock out a traditional band set of classics from their repertoire. The night will be highlighted by special guest appearances throughout the concert by original members Dave Hope, Kerry Livgren, and Robby Steinhardt—marking the first time all original members of the band will be on the same stage together in more than 30 years." However, Steinhardt suffered a heart attack days before the concert and was unable to participate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kansas-violinist-robby-steinhardt-suffers-heart-attack/ |title=KANSAS Violinist Robby Steinhardt Suffers Heart Attack |publisher=ultimateclassicrock.com |date=2013-08-12 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref>  ===2014–present: Retirement of Steve Walsh===  On July 2, 2014, a declaration was issued on the band's official Facebook page announcing the impending retirement of lead singer [[Steve Walsh (musician)|Steve Walsh]]: "On June 30, 2014, Steve Walsh informed the members of KANSAS that he is resigning from the band. His last performance with Kansas will be August 16, 2014, in Sioux City, Iowa, at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. As Kansas continues on, the band wishes Steve only the best in his future endeavors, and thanks him for the 41 years."  On July 6, 2014, former Kansas lead singer [[John Elefante]] issued a statement that he had been contacted by the band on July 2, to discuss rejoining. However, on July 4, after turning to prayer, said that it was not meant to be. At that point, he also cited Steve Walsh as one of the reasons he wanted to become a singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://facebook.com/JohnElefanteMusic}}</ref>  A following statement was issued on July 14, 2014 through Kansas' official Facebook page stating that [[Chicago]] area native Ronnie Platt had been selected as the band's new lead vocalist and keyboard player: "Kansas would like to introduce lead vocalist and keyboardist, Ronnie Platt, as its newest member. Ronnie's first show with the band will be September 12, in Oklahoma City, OK, where he will take over singing duties for departing vocalist Steve Walsh."  On July 24, 2014, the band announced that their longtime lighting specialist David Manion will be handling the main keyboard parts for the band on stage along with Platt. Manion has also handled keyboard responsibilities for Kansas' bassist and vocalist [[Billy Greer]]’s band, [[Seventh Key]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://facebook.com/KansasBand}}</ref>  In March 2015, the band released a documentary, ''[[Miracles Out of Nowhere]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miraclesoutofnowhere.com}}</ref> The documentary chronicles the band's formation and follows them throughout their success with ''Leftoverture'' and ''Point of Know Return''. It was initially available in a limited-edition release that contained an extra DVD of bonus interviews. The documentary was released alongside a companion CD of the same name that contained a selection of the band's greatest hits along with snippets of commentary from the documentary.   On September 1, 2015, a press release announced that Kansas had signed with [[Inside Out Music]], a [[Germany|German]] [[Record label|label]] dedicated to progressive rock and related genres, for the release of their upcoming 15th studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideoutmusic.com/newsdetailed.aspx?IdNews=16312 |title=Kansas signs worldwide recording deal with InsideOutMusic  |publisher=insideoutmusic.com |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}</ref> The release of this album marked the longest period to date between studio releases, since Kansas' previous album, ''Somewhere to Elsewhere'', had been released over 15 years prior, in the year 2000.  ==Influence== {{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}} Kansas' two most popular songs, "[[Carry On Wayward Son]]" and "[[Dust in the Wind]]," have been covered by other artists, and featured on film and television soundtracks.
