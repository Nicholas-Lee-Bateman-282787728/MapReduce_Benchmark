   Christopher Wesson "Chris" Bosh (born March 24, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A high school "Mr. Basketball" in Texas, Bosh left college at Georgia Tech after one season with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball team to enter the 2003 NBA draft. He was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in a very competitive draft class that included multiple future NBA superstars such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Carmelo Anthony. While at Toronto, Bosh emerged as one of the young stars in the league; he became a five-time NBA All-Star, was named to the All-NBA second team once, appeared for the US national team (with whom he won a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics), and supplanted former fan-favorite Vince Carter as the face and leader of the Raptors franchise. In the 2006–07 season, Bosh led the Raptors to their first NBA Playoffs berth in five years, and their first ever division title. He left Toronto for the Miami Heat in 2010 as its all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, double doubles, free throws made and attempted, and minutes played. Bosh won his first NBA title after Miami defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4–1 in the 2012 NBA Finals. He won his second title in 2013 as the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 NBA Finals. Bosh was nicknamed "CB4" by Toronto Raptors play-by-play commentator Chuck Swirsky, a combination of Bosh's initials and then jersey number.Gallay, Mike, "The Birthday Bosh", nba.com/raptors, March 24, 2004, accessed April 30, 2008. Seeking to promote sports and education amongst youths in Dallas and Toronto, Bosh set up the Chris Bosh Foundation and regularly speaks to youths about the benefits of reading.

Chris Bosh grew up in Hutchins, Texas.Mawhinney, Janice, "Playing by the book; Raptors star uses money and charisma to make sure literacy is a winner with Toronto schoolkids", Toronto Star, November 26, 2005. A family-oriented person, Bosh often played basketball in the house with his younger brother, Joel.Colbourn, Glenn, "A new Bosh in Raps' town", Toronto Star, January 13, 2004. By four years of age, he began learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym where his dad played pick-up games.About, Official Website of Chris Bosh, accessed August 3, 2007.  Although Bosh was always tall since youth and this allowed him to out-rebound others in basketball games,Aldridge, Andre, "CHATTING WITH CB4", nba.com, January 2, 2007, accessed August 3, 2007. he only started learning the game around fourth grade at a playground near his grandmother's house. Apart from basketball, Bosh also played baseball up until high school, preferring to play as a first baseman. Growing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influences on his personality and considered NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, modeling his play after him. Academically, Bosh always did well in schoolChris Bosh Biography, jockbio.com, accessed August 25, 2007. but he began to garner significant attention from college recruiters when he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and the USA Today National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.Player Bio: Chris Bosh, ramblinwreck.com, accessed April 29, 2007. The teenager went on to lead Lincoln High to win the Class 4A state title before 16,990 fans as he racked up 23 points, 17 rebounds and nine blocks. Bosh was subsequently named High School Player of the Year by Basketball America, Powerade Player of the Year in Texas, a First-team all-American by Parade, McDonald's and EA Sports, a Second-team all-American by USA Today and SLAM Magazine, a First-team all-state player, and "Mr. Basketball" in Texas by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches. With his combination of grades and basketball skills, Bosh was on a number of college recruiting lists. The University of Florida and the University of Memphis made serious attempts, but it was Paul Hewitt, coach of Georgia Tech, who made the best impression. Bosh felt Hewitt would look out for his best interests and respect his aspirations to play professional basketball; moreover, Georgia Tech's transition offense impressed the teenager. Bosh eventually chose to follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management. There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, but by the end of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA. He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career. He said he intends to obtain a college degree in the future, to fulfill a promise made to his mother. In a strong draft class including future All-Stars LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade, Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in the 2003 NBA draft and was signed on July 8, 2003."Raptors Sign Chris Bosh", nba.com/raptors, July 8, 2003, accessed March 20, 2007. Prior to his signing, however, other NBA teams made offers for Bosh as they knew Toronto needed a veteran scorer, and Raptors star Vince Carter himself pressed for a trade. General Manager Glen Grunwald turned everyone down. In his rookie season Bosh was forced to play out of position as the Raptors' starting center after Antonio Davis was traded to the Chicago Bulls.Feschuk, Dave, "Vegas trip leaves Bosh bushed", thestar.com, February 18, 2007, accessed March 20, 2007. Night after night, the teenager with the "slim frame" battled against opponents who had a significant size and strength advantage over him. Bosh—who cited teammate Michael Curry as his mentor—was often praised by his coaches for his heart, and willingness to play through pain and injuries resulting from his lack of body strength compared to some of the league's strong forwards and centers."Chris Bosh's evolution into an NBA star", ctv.ca, February 18, 2007, accessed March 20, 2007.

Bosh was rewarded by being selected to the All-Rookie First Team for the 2003–04 season.  With the departure of the disenchanted franchise face of the team, Vince Carter, in December 2004, Bosh was simultaneously anointed as the new leader around whom Toronto would build.2004–05: End Of The Carter Era, nba.com/raptors, accessed April 27, 2007.

But Orlando held home court advantage, and the Raptors were unable to win the first two games in Amway Arena. In Game 1, Bargnani started at small forward. This did not matter, as Orlando took a huge lead in the first quarter. Howard dominated the game, finishing with 22 points, 25 rebounds and 5 blocks.

Back on the road in Game 5, Toronto was outplayed by the Magic in the second half, and the Raptors eliminated from the first round four games to one. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference thereafter, "Whether it's protecting [Bosh] inside the paint, getting a little bit more of a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul.Smith, Doug, "Colangelo: Sam's safe 'for now'", thestar.com, April 30, 2008, accessed July 13, 2009.

I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good."

Bosh finished the game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocked shots.  By season's end, the Heat had embraced a small ball strategy that featured Bosh at the center position.  In the playoffs, Bosh started at center and averaged 14.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a game.  In game 1 of the East Semifinal against the Indiana Pacers, he suffered a lower abdominal strain that forced him to miss the rest of the series and the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston.  Boston pushed Miami to 7 games, and in the final game Bosh scored 19 points, including 3 of 4 shooting from three point range, to help the Heat advance to their second straight NBA Finals, this time against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder won the first game of the series before Miami rolled to a 4-1 victory, giving Bosh and James their first NBA title.  Bosh scored 24 points in the deciding game 5 and averaged 14.6 points and 9.4 rebounds in the Finals. Bosh remained the Heat's starting center during the 2012–13 season. On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra.Chris Bosh to start All-Star Game The Heat achieved the league's best record and swept through the first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in 5 games, with Bosh scoring 20 points to go with 19 rebounds in a crucial game 3 win in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs as the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven game series against Indiana. The Heat and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs blew out Miami in game 3 to take a 2-1 series lead. In game 4, Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to complement Wade's 32 points and James' 33 points to bolster the Heat's win, tying the series. San Antonio would bounce back in game 5 to force the Heat to win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of game 6, LeBron James missed a three pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was scoreless in Game 7 by Tim Duncan but the Miami Heat still won game 7 and their 2nd consecutive, 3rd overall, NBA Championship. In the 2013–14 season, Bosh played and started in 79 games, averaging 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He also hit a career-high 74 three point shots on 33 percent shooting from beyond the arc. In the playoffs Bosh scored 20 points in game 2 of Miami's first round series against the Charlotte Bobcats and posted 15 points with 11 rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets in the second game of the semifinal series. In game 4 against Brooklyn, Bosh hit a late corner three-pointer to help Miami take a 3–1 lead over the Nets, and hit four three-pointers in game 5 as the Heat advanced to play the Pacers for the second year in a row in the Eastern Conference Finals. Against the Pacers, Bosh struggled offensively through the first three games, scoring 9 points in each contest before scoring 25 points on 3-for-5 shooting from beyond the three point arc in a game 4 victory.  Bosh would follow that up with 20 points and 10 rebounds in game 5 as the Pacers won and forced a sixth game in Miami.  In game 6, Bosh scored 25 points as the Heat advanced to their fourth straight NBA Finals. The Heat would again face the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 NBA Finals, but Miami lost the series in five games. On July 30, 2014, Bosh re-signed with the Heat after LeBron James announced he was leaving Miami to sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers. After averaging 21.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals over the first 23 games of the 2014–15 season, Bosh was ruled out indefinitely on December 15 with a strained calf.Josh McRoberts has torn meniscus He went on to miss eight games before returning on December 29 against the Orlando Magic.

After his NBA career began, Bosh was named in March 2006 to the 2006–2008 United States men's national basketball team program, and helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour. In August 2006, Bosh was named as a member of the 2006 USA World Championship Team. Together with fellow 2003 draftees Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kirk Hinrich, this team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal, defeating former 2004 Olympic champion Argentina.2006 FIBA World Championship, fiba.com, accessed March 20, 2007. Bosh was ranked sixth in field goal percentage. Following the 2006–07 season, Bosh was named to the team that would compete in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. However, he sustained a foot injury and withdrew from the squad.Chris Bosh leaves U.S. training camp because of left foot injury, sports.yahoo.com, August 15, 2007, accessed November 5, 2007.

He averaged 9.1 points per game, and led the team in rebounds with 6.1 a game.USA, usabasketball.com, accessed August 25, 2008. On June 29, 2012, Bosh called men's national team coach Mike Krzyzewski and chairman Jerry Colangelo to tell them that he would not participate in the 2012 Olympics in London to recover from a lower abdominal strain that kept him out of some playoff games.   Bosh has traditionally played the power forward position, including during his first season with the Miami Heat, however starting in the 2011-2012 season he began to start at center and has played the position during the team's consecutive championships and most recent run to the Finals in 2014. Listed at 6&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in (2.11&nbsp;m) and 235&nbsp;pounds (107&nbsp;kg), Bosh possesses excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size.Big, bad Raptors trample Wolves, thestar.com, October 9, 2009, accessed October 14, 2009. He is particularly noted for his ability to drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he is also proficient—but he is also known for his well-developed jump shot.Thomsen, Ian, "Leading man", sportsillustrated.cnn.com, February 6, 2007, accessed March 20, 2007. Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: "We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work either. I don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth."MacKenzie, Holly, "Led by Bosh, Raptors drop Pacers for fifth straight win", nba.com, January 31, 2010, accessed February 1, 2010. When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to team mates who were in better shooting positions.Grange, Michael, "Bosh plays leading role in playoff push", globeandmail.com, April 6, 2007, accessed April 7, 2007. He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left.Raptors Post-Up, nba.com/raptors, November 8, 2006, accessed March 20, 2007. It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his "arrival" to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime. When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot .343 from the three point arc for the season; he improved to .400 the following season. Despite his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three pointers throughout the 2012 championship run, the 2012-2013 season and the 2013 title run. During the 2013-2014 Bosh shot and made more three pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs. Bosh has stepped up in games whenever Lebron James or Dwyane Wade are out with injury, even gaining a reputation for hitting clutch three pointers during the regular season. Such examples include the January 5th 2012 game tying three pointer against the Hawks in Atlanta with both James and Wade out, and a game winning three pointer on March 31, 2013 against the Spurs, also without James and Wade.  A similar scenario occurred on December 28, 2013, as Bosh scored 37 points including a game winning three pointer with 0.5 seconds left against the Portland Trail Blazers with James sidelined. In terms of leadership, Bosh has always led by example. When he was the leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to maintain his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his team mates to match his work ethic. However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to team mates who make bad calls on the court.Feschuk, Dave, "Chris Bosh: Father figure", thestar.com, April 6, 2007, accessed April 6, 2007. Throughout his career, comparisons have been made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique. Whereas the former does not possess the latter's defensive abilities, Bosh was observed to have adopted a greater defensive dimension to his game after his stint with Team USA at the 2008 Olympics where they won the gold medal.  Besides his on-the-court exploits, Bosh was a National Honor Society member and graduated with honors from Lincoln. He is also a member of the National Society of Black Engineers and the Dallas Association of Minority Engineers. Following his success in the NBA, Bosh soon had his own YouTube channel,CBTV, youtube.com, accessed January 15, 2010. and has since made various TV appearances. In December 2009, First Ink, a DVD featuring comedic digital shorts and a documentary about Bosh was released.

Remembering the challenges he faced as a youth, Bosh founded the organization to help younger people in academics and athletics.Official website, Chris Bosh Foundation, accessed March 20, 2007. The Foundation, with programs in Toronto and Dallas, has worked closely with organizations such as the Toronto Special Olympics to raise important funding for community projects. Bosh's mother, Freida, has served as CEO of the Foundation. As an avid reader, Bosh also regularly speaks to groups of children about the benefits of reading, and has received the NBA Community Assist Award for his active contributions for the Raptors community development program in Toronto and Dallas during the course of the NBA campaign."Chris Bosh Receives NBA Community Assist Award", nba.com/raptors, July 19, 2005, accessed March 20, 2007.

Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home.Feschuk, Dave, "Raptor Bosh a deadbeat dad, lawsuit says", thestar.com, March 24, 2009, accessed March 25, 2009.

Mathis' lawyer also told the press, "My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything on our side... She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers.
