 The Audi A6 is an executive car made by the German automaker Audi AG, now in its fourth generation. As the successor to the Audi 100, the A6 is manufactured in Neckarsulm, Germany – and is available in saloon and wagon configurations, the latter marketed by Audi as the Avant. All generations of the A6 have offered either front-wheel drive or Torsen-based four-wheel drive – marketed by Audi as their quattro system. Second- and third- generation A6 models have shared their platform with the company's Allroad models.    Audi's mid-size car was previously named the Audi 100 (or Audi 5000 in the United States), and was released in three successive generations (Audi C1, Audi C2 and Audi C3). In 1994, the latest generation (C4) of the Audi 100 received a facelift and was renamed as the Audi A6, to fit in with Audi's new alphanumeric nomenclature (as the full-size A8 had just been introduced). The exterior was changed only slightly from the "C4" Audi 100 – new front and rear lights, new radiator grille, similarly with chassis and engine and transmission choices. The United Kingdom was the first market to receive the A6, as stock of RHD Audi 100s had run out before expected, and before the rest of mainland Europe. The new engines for the A6 were 1.8-litre 20v inline four-cylinder, 2.6-Litre 12V V6 and 2.8-litre 30v V6 petrol engines, with the 2.3-litre inline five engine being dropped on most markets. For the diesel engines, an inline four 1.9 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI), and the inline five (R5) 2.5 TDI () were available. Until 1997, the A6 came with several different engines, two of them turbodiesel, and most of them available with Audi's Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. The A6 was available with saloon and Avant bodies. The C4 design was available with the following engines: Upon introducing the C4 series A6, Audi made small revisions to what was previously known as the Audi S4, renaming it the Audi S6; the S4 name would eventually be re-used for a completely different model derived from Audi's smaller Volkswagen Group B platform-based Audi A4.  As this was the first S6 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the Ur-S6, derived from the German augmentive, "Ursprünglich" (meaning: original). It was available as both a saloon/sedan (typ 4A5), and an "Avant" (typ 4A9) (estate/wagon) to European and United States customers, but only as a saloon in Canada, Asia and Australia. From its launch in late 1994, the Audi S6 was powered by a  turbocharged inline five-cylinder petrol engine (parts code prefix: 034, identification code: AAN) with a Bosch Motronic electronic engine control unit (ECU), producing a motive power output of  at 5,900&nbsp;revolutions per minute (rpm), and  at around 1,950&nbsp;rpm, whilst consuming high octane "Super Plus" 98RON unleaded petrol.  This powerful engine gave the S6 good performance with a top speed of , and 0 to  in 6.7&nbsp;seconds; with  being reached in 17.5&nbsp;seconds. The vehicle was available with a standard six-speed manual transmission (five-speed only in North America), and Audi's dynamic Torsen T-1 quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. Audi made a high-performance, 4.2&nbsp;litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AEC) with a Bosch KE-Motronic ECU available as an option in the original European S4s, and made the decision to continue to do so with the S6, making a  version of the 4.2 available as an optional upgrade over the 2.2&nbsp;litre inline five-cylinder turbo.  Unlike the five-cylinder turbocharged version, the V8-powered S6 was supplied with a four-speed automatic transmission as standard, but kept the quattro four wheel drive.  A six-speed manual gearbox was also available as an option. As a swan song to the C4 platform, an even more powerful, and very limited-production Audi S6 PLUS was briefly available to European customers.  The S6 PLUS, developed by Audi's wholly owned high performance subsidiary, quattro GmbH, was available for sale during the 1997 model year only (production from June 1996 to October 1997).  A total of 952 cars were produced–855 Avant, and 97 saloons. It was powered by another version of the 32 valve (four valves per cylinder) 4.2&nbsp;litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AHK, later to be seen in the Audi S8 as AKH).  Audi's performance division reworked key parts of the internal combustion engine, increasing the motive power to .  It was only available with a revised six-speed manual transmission (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DGU) (gear ratios - 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730), with a final drive ratio of 4.111. Further revisions were made to the suspension, brakes and roadwheels.  The front brake discs were enlarged to  in diameter by  thick.  Standard roadwheels were 8Jx17 "Avus" cast aluminium alloy wheels, with an optional 7Jx16 alloy wheel for use with winter tyres was also available. With so much power on tap, the S6 Plus saloon could reach  from a standstill in 5.6&nbsp;seconds, with the Avant a tenth of a second slower at 5.7&nbsp;seconds. In February 1997, the introduction of a new A6 (Typ 4B), based on a new design automobile platform – the Volkswagen Group C5 platform, with a new range of internal combustion engines was announced and appeared in March at the 1997 Geneva Motor Show. This new A6 moved up a notch in quality, and was marketed in the same categories as the BMW 5-Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The redesigned body presented a modern design, with a fastback styling which set the trend for the Audi lineup, and gave the relatively large saloon an aerodynamic shell with a low coefficient of drag of 0.28. In 2000 and 2001, the "C5" A6 was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list. This new A6 was available with a wide range of engines and configurations. The 30-valve 2.4- and 2.8-litre V6 engines represented the bulk of the A6's development programme, with a multitude of other engine configurations available throughout the globe. As an alternative to the manual transmission, a five-speed tiptronic automatic transmission was also available. The C5 saloon variant arrived in mid-1997 in Europe, late 1997 in North America and Australia, and the Avant in 1998. In Canada, there was no Avant (Audi's name for an estate/wagon) available at all in 1998 – Audi dropped the C4 Avant at the end of the 1997 model year, and jumped straight to the C5 Avant in 1998 in conjunction with its release in the US. As a result of complying with FMVSS, the North American models were equipped with front and rear bumpers that protruded several inches further than their European counterparts, with modified brackets and bumper suspension assemblies as result, and child-seat tethers for occupant safety. In compliance with Canadian law, Canadian models received daytime running lights as standard equipment. North American C5 A6 models received the 2.8-litre, 30-valve V6 engine, the 2.7-litre "biturbo" V6 (also found in the B5 platform S4, ), and the 4.2-litre 40-valve V8 petrol engine (); the two higher-spec. engines were only offered with quattro permanent four-wheel drive. The V8 models arrived with significantly altered exterior body panels, with slightly more flared wheel arches (fenders), revised headlamps and grille design (before being introduced in 2002 to all other A6 models), larger roadwheels (8Jx17-inch), larger brakes and Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive as standard. In 2002, the A6 received a facelift, with revised headlight and grille design, exposed exhaust tips, and slight changes to accessory body moldings, and taillight colour from red to amber in North American models. A new host of engines were also introduced. The 1.8-litre engine was deleted and replaced by a 2.0-litre powerplant with . The 1.9-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) was tweaked to produce a maximum motive power output of , and  of torque, receiving a six-speed manual gearbox in the process. The 2.4-litre V6 gained an extra 5&nbsp;hp and better balancing, and the 2.8-litre V6 engine was replaced by a 3.0-litre engine with . The turbocharged 2.7-litre was revised, resulting in  and , controlled by standard quattro. The V6 diesel was also slightly modified resulting in  (after the second modification) and . A new more powerful V6 diesel was also introduced with  and . The 4.2-litre V8 engine which arrived in 2001 remained unchanged. Also new was the multitronic continuously variable transmission, available in most front-wheel drive models. All models, except the 2.0-litre petrol and 1.9-litre TDI, were available with Audi's trademark four-wheel-drive system, quattro. A four-wheel-drive version of the Avant, with raised ground clearance and slightly altered styling was sold as the Audi allroad quattro, Audi's first crossover SUV. The second-generation A6 was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 2000 and 2001. The updated 2005 A6 won the World Car of the Year award for 2005. In addition, the facelifted third-generation A6 3.0T won two Car and Driver "comparos" that pitted it against other sedans like the BMW 5-Series, the Mercedes E-Class, the Jaguar XF, and the Infinti M. 200px" heights="150px Audi A6 (C5) sedan Audi A6 (C5) Avant Audi A6 (C5, facelift) Avant Dashboard Under the hood of an Audi A6 (C5) Avant 2.5 TDI Quattro The Audi S6 was a high-powered variant of the A6, featuring a modified version of the 4.2-litre V8 engine producing  and . It was available as a saloon and Avant although the Avant version was the only one sold in North America. In the late years of the A6 C5 design, an ultra-high-performance limited-run Audi RS6 model was presented. Weighing in excess of  and producing  and , the RS6 was capable of 0- in 4.5&nbsp;seconds, and on to  in under 17&nbsp;seconds. Initially available as only an Avant, a saloon variant was later added; the saloon version being the only version available to the North American market. The RS6 saloon finished first in a May 2003 Car and Driver comparison test against the BMW M5 (E39), Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG (W210), and Jaguar S-Type R.".   Audi's C5 series A6 Avant formed the basis for an semi-offroad model in 1999, labeled "Audi allroad quattro". Compared to the regular A6, the allroad featured an advanced air suspension system, allowing for increased ground clearance; larger wheels with all-terrain tyres, and flared and unpainted bumpers, giving it a distinct appearance and more overall flexibility over varying terrain. As the name "allroad quattro" suggests, Audi's Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive system was standard equipment for all versions. The standard adjustable air suspension system can lift the car high enough to provide  of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official Land Rover test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing. Conversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only  above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension. Audi's 2.7-litre, twin-turbo V6 petrol engine with  of power and  of peak torque was available initially, alongside the 2.5-litre TDI diesel unit with  and  of torque. A variant of the corporate 4.2-litre V8 petrol engine, was made available in 2003, and a less powerful TDI (163&nbsp;bhp) followed in 2004. Audi stopped production of the allroad in July 2005. Although the model continued to be available for sale throughout 2006 in Europe, there was no 2006 model year for North America. With the return of the "allroad" nameplate to North America, with the 2013 A4 allroad quattro, the C5-Platform allroad quattro has begun to take the name "Ur-allroad." The 'Ur-' is used in the German language, as a prefix to signify 'ancient' or 'early ancestor' (e.g., great-grandmother is Urgroßmutter), and is used informally by car enthusiasts worldwide to refer to the original Audi Quattro that was produced from 1980 - 1991 (the "Ur-Quattro").  The use of the term was then extended to the original S4 and S6 models to differentiate them from later models with the same name; and more recently to the C5 allroad models("Ur-allroad"). The need for differentiating the models is likely because the new B8 A4 allroad lacks the C5's adjustable height/load leveling suspension with shock rate adjustment to load and reinforced uni-body, sports only a nominal towing capacity, and lacks a non-allroad A4 wagon counterpart. Some feel that for these reasons it does not live up to the allroad nameplate and is nothing more than an A4 wagon with a trim package. The C5 design was available with the following engines:   The Typ 4F A6 was released in 2004. Designed by Satoshi Wada in 2001, this model is visually an evolution of the C5, but was lengthened to , and has the new Audi "single-frame grille". Like other contemporary Audis, the A6 has a "tornado line" that runs from the front lights to the rear lights just below the body shoulders. The C6 iteration of the A6 features more sophisticated technology. Most notable is the Multi Media Interface (MMI), which is a system controlling in-car entertainment, satellite navigation, climate control, car settings such as suspension configuration and optional electronic accessories through a central screen interface. This has the advantage of minimising the wealth of buttons normally found on a dashboard by replacing them with controls which operate multiple devices using the integrated display. On the internal combustion engines, the new Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection technology was introduced. Although the line of engines represents the same progression as the former model, all engines were new. The multitronic continuously variable transmission continues as an alternative for front-wheel drive models, alongside a new six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission available in the four-wheel drive models. Audi's "trademark" Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive is available in most of the lineup, and standard in the most powerful models. quattro is not available on the multitronic variants of the A6, but is available on the manual and tiptronic gear systems. Conversely the tiptronic system is not available on the front-wheel drive variants of the car. The six-speed manual gearbox is available with the 3.2-litre V6 engine, but not for the North American market. The Avant was previewd by the Audi Avantissimo concept in 2001 and arrived during the course of 2005. The A6 allroad quattro made its debut in 2006, and as before, is an off-road ready version of the Avant, available with either a 2.7-litre V6 or 3.0-litre V6 Turbocharged Direct Injection diesel engines, or a 3.2-litre V6 or 4.2-litre V8 petrol engine. Interior Centre console of C6 A6, showing tiptronic gear shift lever, Multi Media Interface (MMI) controls, and electronic parking brake This is a long wheelbase version of the A6 sedan for the Chinese market. The vehicle was unveiled in 2005 at the Shanghai Motor Show. The vehicles went on sale in the middle of 2005. Early models include A6L 2.4, with A6L 2.0 TFSI (170PS) followed shortly after. A6L 3.0 quattro (218PS) and A6L 4.2 quattro (335PS) were introduced in 2005. Other models include A6 3.0. The Audi S6 performance variant was introduced in the Frankfurt Motor Show, and produced from early 2006 until 2011. It is powered by a 5.2-litre Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) V10 engine producing a  and . The S6 reaches  from a standstill in 5.2&nbsp;seconds, and the quarter mile 13.5&nbsp;seconds.   Audi announced the C6 series allroad in the spring of 2005 and released it in the summer of 2006. This model was called the Audi A6 allroad quattro (unlike the previous version, which was merely called Audi allroad quattro, with no reference to the A6 nomenclature). The Audi A6 allroad quattro again featured adaptive air suspension and quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. The A6 allroad was powered by a choice of two Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) petrol engines, a 3.2-litre V6 and a 4.2-litre V8, and two TDI diesel engines, a 180&nbsp;PS (132&nbsp;kW) 2.7&nbsp;L and a 233&nbsp;PS (171&nbsp;kW) 3.0&nbsp;L. The tiptronic gearbox is standard on the 4.2 V8 and the 2.7 TDI, but optional on the 3.2 FSI and 3.0 TDI. The 6-speed tiptronic transmission system converted high-torque engine power into both sporty performance and operating convenience, with crisp, fast gear changes. Advanced electronics respond efficiently to all driver input in both D (Drive) and S (Sport) programmes, helping to prevent unwanted upshifts when cornering. The five-mode air suspension can be raised by up to 60&nbsp;mm (2.36&nbsp;in) to provide ground clearance of 185&nbsp;mm (7.28&nbsp;in) which is better than the older four-mode. The car featured a number of off-road styling cues including larger bumpers and sills. In some European markets, this A6 allroad quattro was more expensive than the larger Audi Q7, but air suspension is an expensive option in the Q7. In its native country, Germany, it cost a few hundred Euros less than the Q7. In 2005, the A6 won the World Car of the Year award, and has also won the Practical Caravan "Towcar of the Year" awards, due to its array of towing features such as adjustable suspension height and damping, and the presence of a 123 Trailer Stability Programme.    Audi unveiled a facelifted "C6" Audi A6 on 12 August 2008, at the Moscow International Motor Show. The refresh incorporates some modern Audi design cues to keep the A6 current with the rest of the Audi lineup. There are minor cosmetic changes to the front and rear lights which now have daytime running LEDs, the taillights extend towards the center of the trunk lid and pinch off at the license plate mount, however their shape remains rectangular compared to the more sculpted light clusters found in the 2008 Audi A5, 2008 Audi A4, and 2009 Audi Q5 (the latter three being all-new generations). The intakes below the headlamps are inspired by the Audi RS5. The A6's six (per side) front light-emitting diode (LED) daytime running lights (DRLs) are located within the main headlamp housing, similar to RS6's placement of the LEDs (ten per side), whereas on the S6 these front LEDs (five per side) are found adjacent to the fog lamps in the lower front bumper. The new front and rear fascias from RS6 would be used on the facelifted A6 and S6 lineup. Also updated for 2009 is the Quattro all-wheel drive setup, which is already found on the 2008 Audi A5 and 2008 Audi A4. This new system features a 40/60 front-to-rear torque split and offers a more balanced feel, reducing the understeer that comes from 50/50 AWD platforms. There are now six petrol and four diesel engines available for the upgraded A6. All petrol engines now feature cylinder-direct Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) technology, and all diesel engines now feature common rail (CR) and Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) technologies. There is a new petrol engine, a  3.0-litre supercharged V6, badged as 3.0 TFSI or 3.0T. This new engine is shared with the 2010 Audi S4 and S5 Cabriolet, although in the latter two applications in a higher state of tune and mated to a 7-speed S-tronic dual-clutch transmission. The new engine and revised quattro system give the 2009 Audi A6 3.0 TFSI almost equivalent performance to the Audi S6 5.2 FSI (which is unchanged except for receiving the cosmetic tweaks like the rest of the Audi A6 lineup). Moreover, the S6's weight is 4,500 pounds and 59 percent of weight is distributed to the front which increases understeer. US models went on sale as 2009 model year vehicles, and arrived in U.S. dealerships by the beginning of January. Early models include A6 3.2 FSI (sedan), A6 3.0 TFSI quattro (sedan/Avant), A6 4.2 FSI quattro (sedan), S6 5.2 FSI (sedan).  The latest version of ultra-high-performance Audi RS6 was launched in September 2008 and produced until the third quarter of 2010. Based upon the V10 engine powering the S6, the RS6 features an all-aluminium alloy  V10 twin-turbocharged, Fuel Stratified Injection engine with a dry sump lubrication system. It produces a power output of , and  of torque, making it the most powerful vehicle ever produced by Audi. Initially available only as an Avant, the saloon version went on sale in mid-October 2008. The A6L is a longer wheelbase version of the A6 sedan for the Chinese market. The vehicle was unveiled at Auto Shanghai 2009. Early models included the 2.7 TDI powerplant (189PS). The fourth generation C7 series Audi A6 (internally designated Typ 4G) was launched in early 2011 for the European market and in other markets soon after. It is heavily influenced by the Audi A8 (D4), pulling elements from its exterior details. The A6 shares its interior, platform, and powertrain (Modular Longitudinal Platform) with the Audi A7 four door sedan, which had been released shortly before also in 2011. Compared to the A8 and A7, the A6 has the most aggressive front fascia and LED headlights (optional full LED headlamps). Design work began in 2006, with Jurgen Loffler's exterior design being chosen in 2008. The new A6 increased its wheelbase by nearly  and its width by . The redesign also decreased the car's drag coefficient to 0.25 Cd. European engine choices for the C7 include two petrol engines – a 2.8-litre FSI V6 with  and a , 3.0-litre supercharged FSI engine – and three diesel engines – a 2.0-litre inline four-cylinder and a 3.0-litre turbocharged diesel engine in three states of tune. The European A6 3.0 TFSI will have optional a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and an air suspension, two features that will not be available on the United States model. For North America, the Audi A6 3.0 TFSI quattro will be powered by a 3.0-litre supercharged V6 putting out  , the same engine carried over from the previous-generation A6 3.0 TFSI, but in a higher state of tune and mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. For the United States but not the Canadian market, there will be an entry-level Audi A6 2.0 TFSI FrontTrak (front-wheel drive) with a 2.0-litre turbocharged inline-four, the same engine in the Audi A4 and Q5, but mated to the Multitronic CVT (continuous variable transmission). The 2012 model year A6 features all the driver assistance systems from the A8, plus it adds automotive head-up display, active lane assist. Full LED headlamps with Automatic high beam switching or Audi adaptive light (Xenon) with variable headlight range control. 2012 Audi A6 sedan (US) 2011 Audi A6 3.0 TFSI quattro (Japan) Audi A6 2.0 TDI Avant (Europe) Interior.

The refresh includes styling tweaks to the car's exterior, engine line-up, transmission and MMI infotainment system with faster Tegra 3 processor, Handwriting recognition, Audi connect Telematics with state of the art 4G mobile internet (and online updates for the navigation map), and advanced Matrix LED headlights. All three TFSI and five TDI engines now meet the Euro 6 emission standard. The new TDI Ultra model now comes with glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) springs and both ultra models now come with S-tronic (dual clutch) transmission. A hybrid electric variant was also available for the first time in the A6, offering a 2-litre TFSI  engine combined with a  electric motor. Electric power is supplied via 1.3kWh lithium-ion battery, with electric-only range of 3&nbsp;km for constant  drive and top speed of . The market launch of the A6 Hybrid was scheduled for 2012. However, production of the US model was delayed. The 2013 A6 allroad quattro was launched at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, along with the 2012 RS4 Avant. Sales began in 2012. The first UK deliveries arrived in July 2012. The allroad model contains several unique features. Audi designed more than 1,100 new, unique parts for the allroad, setting it apart from the standard A6 and making it a true all-terrain vehicle. Most obvious, the allroad received special bumpers and fender flares, giving it an aggressive offroad appearance. The bumpers and fender flares feature a tough-wearing, matte finish, contrasting the rest of the body. The roof received this same coating, as well as four longitudinal ribs for increased strength. The unique bumpers also have integrated aluminum skid plates. The allroad featured larger diameter tires than the standard A6 for improved offroad capabilities. Redesigned headlights, larger side mirrors, and a lack of door "rub strips" are unique to the allroad. The allroad comes standard with an adjustable air suspension system can lift the car high enough to provide  of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official Land Rover test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing. Conversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only  above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension.
