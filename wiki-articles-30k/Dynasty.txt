     A dynasty (, ) is a sequence of rulers from the same family,Oxford English Dictionary,  "dynasty, n." Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1897. usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a "house";Oxford English Dictionary,  "house, n.¹ and int, " Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2011. this may be styled "royal", "princely", "comital", etc. depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians consider many sovereign states' histories, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, within a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term "dynasty" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period ("a Ming-dynasty vase"). The word "dynasty" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references ("a Ming vase"). Until the 19th century, it was taken for granted that a legitimate function of a monarch was to aggrandize his dynasty: that is, to increase the territory, wealth, and power of his family members. The longest-surviving dynasty in the world is the Imperial House of Japan, the Yamato dynasty, whose reign is traditionally dated to . Dynasties throughout the world have traditionally been reckoned patrilineally, such as under the Frankish Salic law. Succession through a daughter when permitted was considered to establish a new dynasty in her husband's ruling house. However, some states in Africa (Balobedu), determined descent matrilineally, while rulers have at other times adopted the name of their mother's dynasty when coming into her inheritance: examples include the Dutch House of Orange, the Georgian Bagrationi, and Habsburg-Lorraine. The word "dynasty" is sometimes used informally for people who are not rulers but, for example, members of a family with influence and power in other areas, such as a series of successive owners of a major company. It is also extended to unrelated people such as major poets of the same school or various rosters of a single sports team. The word "dynasty" derives via Latin  from Greek dynastéia (), where it referred to "power", "dominion", and "rule" itself.Liddell, Henry George &&nbsp;al. A Greek–English Lexicon: "". Hosted by Tufts University's Perseus Project. It was the abstract noun of dynástēs (),Liddell &&nbsp;al. A Greek–English Lexicon: "". the agent noun of dynamis (), "power" or "ability",Liddell &&nbsp;al. A Greek–English Lexicon: "". from dýnamai (), "to be able".Liddell &&nbsp;al. "". A ruler in a dynasty is sometimes referred to as a "dynast", but this term is also used to describe any member of a reigning family who retains a right to succeed to a throne. For example, following his abdication, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]] ceased to be a dynastic member of the [[House of Windsor]].  A "dynastic marriage" is one that complies with monarchical [[house law]] restrictions, so that the descendants are eligible to inherit the throne or other [[monarchy|royal]] privileges. The marriage of [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange]], to [[Máxima Zorreguieta]] in 2002 was dynastic, for example, and their [[Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands|eldest child]] is expected to inherit the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] crown eventually. But the marriage of his younger brother [[Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau|Prince Friso]] to [[Mabel Wisse Smit]] in 2003 lacked government support and [[parliamentary]] approval. Thus Friso forfeited his place in the [[order of succession]], lost his title as a ''Prince of the Netherlands'', and left his children without dynastic rights.  In historical and [[monarchy|monarchist]] references to formerly reigning families, a "dynast" is a family member who would have had succession rights, were the monarchy's rules still in force. For example, after the 1914 assassinations of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] and his [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]] wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie von Hohenberg]], their son [[Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg|Max]] was bypassed for the Austrian throne because he was not a [[Habsburg]] dynast. Even since abolition of the Austrian monarchy, Max and his descendants have not been considered the rightful [[pretender]]s by Austrian monarchists, nor have they claimed that position.  The term "dynast" is sometimes used only to refer to [[Patrilineality#Agnatic succession|agnatic]] descendants of a [[realm]]'s monarchs, and sometimes to include those who hold succession rights through [[matrilineality|cognatic]] royal descent. The term can therefore describe overlapping but distinct sets of people. For example, [[David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley]], a nephew of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] through her sister, [[Princess Margaret of the United Kingdom|Princess Margaret]], is in the line of succession to the British crown: in that sense is a British dynast. Yet he is not a [[patrilineality|male-line]] member of the [[royal family]], and is therefore not a dynast of the House of Windsor.  On the other hand, the German [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] [[Ernst August V, Prince of Hanover|Ernst August, Prince of Hanover]] (born 1954), a male-line descendant of [[George III of the United Kingdom]], possesses no legal British name, titles or styles (although he is entitled to re-claim the once-[[duke#Royal dukes|royal dukedom]] of [[Duke of Cumberland|Cumberland]]), was born in the [[order of succession|line of succession]] to the British crown and was bound by Britain's [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]] until it was repealed when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] took effect on 26 March 2015.<ref name=inforce>[http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2015-03-26/HCWS490/ Statement by Nick Clegg MP, UK parliament website], 26 March 2015 (retrieved on same date).</ref> Thus, in 1999 he requested and obtained formal permission from Elizabeth II to marry the Roman Catholic [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Princess Caroline of Monaco]]. Yet a clause of the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]] remained in effect at that time, stipulating that dynasts who marry Roman Catholics are considered "dead" for the purpose of succession to the
