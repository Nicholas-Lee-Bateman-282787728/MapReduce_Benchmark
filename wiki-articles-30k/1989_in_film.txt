November 17 - The story of a mermaid named Ariel who longs to be part of the human world captured imaginations worldwide. The first installment of the Disney Renaissance, The Little Mermaid, became an astounding critical and commercial success and brought a new life to Walt Disney Feature Animation after nearly three decades of humiliation and despair with films like The Black Cauldron. It became Disney's most successful animated film since The Rescuers and relaunched a profound new interest in the animation film genre after notable examples like Akira, The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, My Neighbor Totoro, Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind, Oliver & Company, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, as well as the musical film genre. Following many other remarkable accomplishments since Roy E. Disney, Michael Eisner, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Frank Wells joined to take charge in 1984, The Little Mermaid also reinvigorated public and critical interest in The Walt Disney Company, which would become one of the most prestigious corporations of the 1990s.
