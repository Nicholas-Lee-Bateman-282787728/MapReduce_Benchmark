   Yellowcard are an American rock band formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1997 and based out of Los Angeles since 2000. They are well known for their singles "Ocean Avenue," "Only One," and "Light Up the Sky." Their music is distinctive within their genre because it features the prominent use of a violin. They have released 11 studio albums, with their most recent one, Lift a Sail, released on October 7, 2014. Yellowcard was formed in 1997 in Jacksonville, Fla., after meeting at Douglas Anderson School of the Arts. The band got its name from a phrase its members used in high school: whenever somebody did something stupid at a party, such as spilling a beer on the carpet, they cited soccer rules and gave the offender a “yellow card” for committing a “party foul.” The original lineup featured Ben Dobson on vocals, Todd Clary on guitar and vocals, Ben Harper on guitar, Warren Cooke on bass, and Longineu Parsons III on drums. Modern Amusement frontman Ryan Key appeared as a guest, on background vocals, as did violinist Sean Wellman aka Sean Mackin. Key had also been in California band Craig's Brother. Yellowcard recorded its first album, Midget Tossing, at the Music Factory in Jacksonville Beach.  Where We Stand, Yellowcard's second album, featured the same lineup as Midget Tossing, and Mackin was brought in for more songs. Soon, however, the band fired Dobson and replaced him with former guest vocalist Key. This changed the band's style from hardcore punk to pop punk. It also changed its fan base, leaving them with a fresh start as a band. In early 2000, the band recorded the Still Standing EP. Soon after Still Standing EP was released, Todd Clary left the band. Key then filled both Clary's and Dobson's duties, guitar and vocals respectively. After sending the new EP to friend Steve Lubarsky at Lobster Records, the band signed its first recording contract in June 2000 and in November headed west to Camarillo, Calif., to begin working on another full-length album. The group released its third album, One for the Kids (Lobster Records), in 2001 and followed up with The Underdog EP (Fueled by Ramen Records) in 2002. Both of these were well received by fans. However, soon after The Underdog EP was released, Warren Cooke left for personal reasons. The band then asked Pete Mosely from Inspection 12, to play bass. Before Cooke left, the band filmed an unreleased music video for the song "Powder". The video was later put on the enhanced version of the band's next album, Ocean Avenue. Shortly after releasing The Underdog EP, Yellowcard signed with Capitol Records,[ ] which was looking to sign pop punk groups at the time. Yellowcard began recording their major-label debut in late 2002, and the production of the record was finished in the spring of 2003. During the recording of Ocean Avenue, Mosely left Yellowcard, devoting his time to his first band, Inspection 12, and putting the finishing touches to their upcoming album, Get Rad. The band again began the search for a new bass player and found Alex Lewis, whose sister, Alieke Wijnveldt, contributed vocals to the Ocean Avenue track "View From Heaven". The band released its first single from the album, "Way Away". The song did well on MTV2 and rock radio, peaking at No. 25 on the modern-rock charts. The song created enough buzz to cause the band's mainstream explosion. In the middle of the band's first headlining tour, Peter Mosely decided to leave Inspection 12 and asked if he could rejoin Yellowcard. Because Mosely had been an integral part of the writing for Ocean Avenue and had also been friends with most of the band's members since high school, Lewis was asked to leave, and Mosely was reinstated as the bass player.  In late 2003, the band finally broke through with a hit single, "Ocean Avenue". The song premiered on MTV's TRL program, and quickly shot up the charts to No. 1. Radio eventually picked up on the single, and the song made it to No. 37 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song "Empty Apartment" was also featured on an episode of the TV show One Tree Hill. Suddenly, Yellowcard was everywhere from the covers of Alternative Press, to headliners of the 2004 Warped Tour, to on stage at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, performing "Ocean Avenue". The band took home the MTV2 award as well.  Yellowcard featured on an episode of MTV's Real World/Road Rules Challenge, performing "Way Away" while cast members trashed a mock hotel room in true rock star fashion. The album's first track, "Way Away" appeared on the soundtracks of SSX 3 and Madden NFL 2004.  The album's second track, "Breathing", also appeared in EA's Burnout 3: Takedown and FlatOut 2.  Following "Ocean Avenue"'s success, the band released the single "Only One", a rock ballad which also did fairly well on TRL and radio. The Ocean Avenue album sold over one million copies in the US alone. As Ocean Avenue's popularity began to decrease, the band spent some time contributing songs to various other soundtracks. The first, "Gifts And Curses", appeared in the hit film Spider-Man 2. Another, a cover of Lagwagon's "Violins", was featured on Rock Against Bush, Vol. 2 compilation album. At the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, Yellowcard performed a cover of the song "Don't You (Forget About Me)" during a special tribute to the movie The Breakfast Club. On August 13, 2013, an acoustic version of Ocean Avenue was released in honor of the platinum album's 10th anniversary.[ ]  After almost two years of touring, Yellowcard took a few months off at the beginning of 2005. Ryan Key and Peter Mosely moved to New York City to write the songs for their upcoming album. The rest of the band remained in Los Angeles. The band regrouped in LA in the spring and began pre-production for the follow-up to Ocean Avenue in March. Recording and production was finished in September and advertising began for the album. The band had originally announced that the album was expected for August 2005, but production and other delays pushed the release date back several months. In the months following, many problems had arisen between the band mates, mainly involving Ben Harper. Ryan Key has made many comments since then stating, "The fame went to their heads." After months of increasing tension stemming from Harper's increased involvement with his indie label Takeover Records, Harper was removed from the group. [ ] He was replaced by Ryan Mendez from the band Staring Back. After leaving Yellowcard, Harper joined Amber Pacific as a touring guitarist. Harper left the band when they returned to the studio, with Rick Hanson assuming the permanent guitarist role. Harper is now in the band HeyMike! and runs Takeover Records in California. Lights and Sounds was finally released on January 24, 2006.  A loose concept album, the theme centers around the band's negative feelings towards Los Angeles. Prior to the release of Lights and Sounds Ryan Key said that this ambitious album would probably alienate a large portion of their fan base, and that he was "100 percent okay with that." 20 songs were recorded for the album, 14 of which are on the CD, plus a B-side available on import versions, CD singles, and at the iTunes Store, called "Three Flights Down". The opening track, "Three Flights Up", was the first instrumental track on a Yellowcard album since "Interlewd" on the band's first album, Midget Tossing. To date, those two and "Convocation" from their latest release, Lift a Sail, are the only instrumental tracks the band has released on an album. The title track, "Lights and Sounds", was the first single, released a week before the album. It peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. It is also featured on the video games Burnout Revenge and Guitar Hero: Modern Hits. In its first week of release the album sold just over 90,000 copies, but it only went on to receive gold status. High first week sales are most likely the result of high anticipation of the album, as it was the follow-up to the highly successful Ocean Avenue; low total sales backup Ryan's statement about the album being very ambitious and different in sound from Ocean Avenue. On May 6, 2006, the second and final single and video of the album, "Rough Landing, Holly", was released. The single wasn't as well received as the first, and after its first week of release it quickly dropped on the charts. In May 2006, Ryan Key had surgery on his vocal cords done after having problems with his singing. He had started having problems in December 2005. He was mute for a week and couldn't sing for more than a month. The band, after canceling some shows and receiving some time off from touring, joined the Virgin Mega Tour for Summer 2006. On October 16, 2006, the band announced over their official website that they were back in the studio recording a new album. Guitarist Ryan Mendez posted on the official Yellowcard message board on October 21, 2006, that three songs had been completed and stated "I really think fans of both older and newer Yellowcard are going to be very happy." Pre-production began in October 2006 and tracking began on January 2007. Between the months of January and March 2007, studio footage labeled "Yellowcard Sessions" regarding the band's progress on making the album was posted on the band's MySpace, with a new video added every Thursday. In total, 10 videos have been posted, with additional footage released on the deluxe CD/DVD edition of Paper Walls.  Additionally, in January 2007, some sample demo songs  were released on the band's MySpace, though they were only rough recordings from preproduction and not the final recorded versions. The first demo was a 30-second preview of the iTunes bonus track, "Bombers", and the second was a clip of an unmixed version of "Light Up the Sky". The first Yellowcard show since October 2006 took place on March 29, 2007, at the Troubadour in Hollywood, California.  At the show lead singer Ryan Key announced to a sold out crowd that the new album would be titled Paper Walls. He said he would "probably get in trouble for [it]," but went on to announce the title anyway; Key also announced the album title during a concert at Southern Connecticut State University. During the Troubadour show, Yellowcard played two songs from their new album ("Fighting" and "The Takedown"). Yellowcard played an acoustic set the next night at the Troubadour and premiered two new songs, "Shadows and Regrets" and "Light Up the Sky". In the teaser of an interview with Jason Tate of absolutepunk.net released on June 17 (one month before the release of the album), Key described the album as ...very much a record of hope and finding yourself again. It’s after you’ve come through all of that – going to the height of it – and picking yourself back up again. And by “hitting rock bottom” I don’t mean in record sales or fame or any of that shit. I mean personally – emotionally...Paper Walls is the story, the feeling, of what it’s like to be out of those holes, looking back, no regrets, but smarter and having grown through them. The whole interview was released on July 17, the release date of the album. Paper Walls was released in the U.S. on July 17 (July 16 on iTunes) in an additional CD/DVD format, as Lights and Sounds was the previous year. The DVD contains exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the band, an extensive photo gallery and two additional live bonus tracks.Yellowcardbr.com On July 9, Yellowcard released Paper Walls on their Myspace music player to give fans a taste of what was to come on the new album. Yellowcard announced on May 15 on their MySpace blog that the first single would be "Light Up the Sky". This song was released to iTunes and radio on June 5. Soon after its release, Paper Walls became the second most popular album on iTunes and the most popular album in the alternative section. In June 2007, Yellowcard was voted to do AOL Sessions Under Cover. It was released on July 20, and it featured two songs from Paper Walls. The album debuted at No. 13 on the U.S. Billboard 200 selling about 40,000 copies in its first week.  Yellowcard promoted their new album nonstop after its release and started touring for Paper Walls.  They supported Blue October in their United States 2007 fall tour and also supported Linkin Park in Japan in November/December 2007. While touring for Paper Walls, Peter Mosely announced in a MySpace blog message that he would be leaving Yellowcard to pursue other endeavors, moving back to Jacksonville and rejoining his old band. Josh Portman from the bands Near Miss and Staring Back took over on bass until the reformation of Yellowcard in 2010, upon which Sean O'Donnell of Reeve Oliver became the bass player. The band canceled several European shows in January due to drummer Longineu Parsons taking a couple months off. He spent the time with his grandmother in Jacksonville, Fla., who raised him and whose health was failing.[ ] On January 7 Yellowcard went to the Middle East to do a USO tour.  They went to Kuwait, but as originally planned, couldn't get into Iraq because of the president arriving and canceling all flights there.[ ] Yellowcard was originally scheduled to headline a spring tour with All Time Low, but All Time Low dropped out to take part in the Alternative Press spring tour.  They were then replaced by MxPx, who canceled a few weeks later. Yellowcard then went on an acoustic tour with The Spill Canvas, Secondhand Serenade, PlayRadioPlay!, and Treaty of Paris. Yellowcard released a live album on January 22, 2008, titled iTunes Live from Las Vegas at the Palms. It was recorded during their Blue October Tour in October 2007 in Las Vegas. Yellowcard announced in an interview in April 2008 that they would be going on an "indefinite hiatus." Their European tour set for 2008 was canceled, and instead the band embarked on an acoustic tour in Spring 2008 before going on hiatus. Another reason for the band's hiatus was individual member situations. Longineu Parsons took some time off in the winter to spend time with family and is now part of a side project band based in Jacksonville, FL. Sean got married in 2008, and he wanted to take some time off to spend with his family. Ryan Key stated that the members needed some time to figure out their personal lives. The band didn't know how long the hiatus would be, but they assured their fans they would not be breaking up, just taking some time off. In May 2008, Yellowcard left Capitol Records and was left unsigned. The original Yellowcard members, Ben Harper, Warren Cooke, Todd Clary, Longineu Parsons and Ben Dobson, announced they would be performing tracks from Where We Stand in Jacksonville, Florida. Yellowcard announced on their MySpace page that they would be performing their first show in months at Utah State University on September 30, 2008. The song choice was much like that of their recent tour performed with Ryan Key, Ryan Mendez, and Sean Mackin, which featured songs from their entire discography. The band later announced on their MySpace page that they would be having another acoustic performance at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana on November 13, 2008. Ryan Key and Sean O'Donnell of Reeve Oliver formed a small side project called Big If. Big If released many demos online, and had a record due out in late 2009 which was cancelled. The band featured a more pop punk approach in most of their first songs, though by the time they had reached the second set of demos they had almost completely progressed into a pop rock style. After the band's fourth set of demos, the band announced a fundraising event on February 10, 2010, called the "Help Mend A Heart Auction", which was to fund Jordan Pundik's mother's heart transplant operation. After that final announcement, there has been no word from the band, and their MySpace page is no longer active. In early January 2009, it was rumored that Longineu Parsons had joined the band Lostprophets to fill in a gap left when their drummer left to join Nine Inch Nails. However, Lostprophets' bassist Stuart Richardson and Longineu Parsons himself have stated that these reports are untrue.  On June 16, 2009, Capitol released an EP titled Deep Cuts, which consists of four previously released tracks. Longineu Parsons played drums for Adam Lambert from October 2009 through September 18, 2010, returning to Yellowcard after its hiatus. Longineu Parsons mentioned in a YouTube video that the band had started talking about a new record.[ ] Yellowcard's official Facebook page announced on August 1, 2010, that the band has reformed and will be working on a new record. Peter Mosely, the former bass player, was replaced by Sean O'Donnell, of Reeve Oliver and Ryan's other side project, Big If, in the new record. Regarding the direction of the new album, Key said on the Hopeless Records website on August 2, "We’re talking about a ton of different ideas, and we’re itching to start as soon as possible. Ultimately, we want to make something the fans will love. What we love to do most, is look out from the stage and see people exploding with energy, and I think we keep that in mind while we are writing. We miss being out on the road playing for Yellowcard fans all around the world, and without their support we wouldn’t have a career." Yellowcard released dates for many new concerts, throughout the majority of 2011 and some of 2010. The band toured with All Time Low throughout Europe in March 2011, around the same time that the album was released. Since the reformation announcement, the Yellowcard YouTube account was reopened and featured weekly sessions about recording of the new album. It was also in these sessions that a handful of names and snippets of songs were released. Big If songs "Empty Street" Hide" and "Hang You Up" were both rumored to be reworked and featured on the new record (Empty Street ultimately did not make the cut). One of the first confirmed tracks on the new record, "See Me Smiling" was an instrumental demo Ryan Mendez wrote and recorded at his home studio, which he sent to the rest of the band. They decided to record it for the new record. The bridge is one of Key's favorite vocal parts in all of Yellowcard's library. "Sing For Me" was confirmed in the November issue of Alternative Press Magazine, Issue 269. The song is written from the perspective of Key's terminally ill aunt, Aunt Stephanie, who was mentioned in "Rock Star Land". The recording process finished on November 8, 2010. On November 13, 2010, Yellowcard played their first show after coming back from hiatus at The Glass House in Pomona, California. This was the first time the whole band has played since December 2007, during which Ryan Key revealed the name of the new record after insistent chants. The new record, he announced, was to be titled When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes. Shortly afterward, they played the first single from the new record, "For You, and Your Denial" Responding to the apparent lack of Yellowcard's older work at The Glass House show, Key stated that it was to keep the energy up in the crowds. In addition to the Europe tour in March, Yellowcard announced a Spring 2011 US Tour with All Time Low, Hey Monday, and The Summer Set. The band later announced the name and release date of the first single, "For You, and Your Denial". It was made available for purchase on iTunes and streaming at www.absolutepunk.net starting January 18, 2011. Also, the music video for this song was recently released and is currently online. The second single, "Hang You Up", was released February 22. The new album released on March 22, 2011, on iTunes and CD. Ryan Key also recorded a song with Silverstein called "Stay Posi" (Stay Positive) for the Take Action! Vol 10. Compilation.[ ]  In the May issue of Alternative Press, former bassist Pete Mosely revealed he was contacted by LP about rejoining before the band reconvened but ultimately decided not to reunite with the rest of Yellowcard. He states his fallout with Ryan Key as a primary reason, stating he wished to regain the friendship they once had. Key and Mosely co-wrote most of Yellowcard's material from Ocean Avenue onward. In the late spring and early summer of 2011, Yellowcard participated in a brief US tour with Good Charlotte and Runner Runner. In fall 2011, Yellowcard headlined a US tour with Every Avenue (which Ryan Key had co-wrote two songs with "Girl Like That" (2009) and "Tie Me Down" (2011) and Go Radio. In June 2011, during an interview with Punkvideosrock.com, Ryan Key stated that the band would participate in a headlining tour in the fall of 2011. On October 24, 2011, Yellowcard released When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes Acoustic. This release was generally a surprise to the fan base, as it was announced only two days earlier during their show in Chicago (and sold following the show at the merchandise table). The album was streaming on Absolutepunk.net for one day, and is now available on iTunes. In addition, the band mentioned that the record is available at select indie record stores. Beginning on November 28, 2011, and continuing into December, Yellowcard participated in a Co-Headlining a Tour with Saves The Day and supporting act The Wonder Years. The tour stopped at several cities in the UK including Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and London. Beginning around the holidays in mid-December, the band returned to the United States completing more than a full year of touring. Yellowcard announced at several shows in November 2011 that they would be returning to the studio in early 2012 to record a new record. Ryan Key stated that the positive reception from When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes and the overall positive energy that the band is generating is inspiration to begin writing again. The band has already begun to write material for the new record. On February 10 it was announced that all the new music had been demo'd and Key would start writing lyrics. On February 3, 2012 Sean O'Donnell posted a message on the band's website stating he was leaving the band because he was getting married and wanted to focus on his family and not be out touring all year. On the 17th of the same month, also on the band's website, it was announced that Josh Portman would be filling the spot as bassist. On March 2, Ryan Key posted a tweet to fellow musician Alex Gaskarth (from All Time Low), confirming one of the new tracks on the upcoming record was entitled "The Surface of the Sun". On March 5, 2012 Yellowcard entered the studio to begin recording their new album. The next day, they broadcast part of their studio recording live. Ryan Mendez also stated in the live chat that there would be 10 tracks on the new album. In a video posted by TheInsider.com, on March 15, Ryan Key stated that one of the words in the album title is "Air". He also stated in their live studio feed that there's a title track on the album, and confirmed the existence of an entirely acoustic song named "Ten" in the same interview. Alex Gaskarth from All Time Low, Cassadee Pope from Hey Monday, and Taylor Jardine from We Are The In Crowd will be appearing as guest vocalists on the album. Yellowcard announced that they finished the record on April 8, after 5 weeks of recording. On May 21, the first single from the album, "Always Summer" premiered on the website AbsolutePunk and was available for free streaming. The next day, it was available for purchase on iTunes and Amazon. On June 3, Absolute Punk announced the title of the new record, Southern Air. On June 12, Yellowcard announced the track listing for Southern Air. Ryan Mendez later confirmed that the US release date is August 14, and the Japan release date is August 15. On June 28, during a commercial at the X Games on ESPN, a clip from the track "Surface of the Sun" was heard.  On July 11, Yellowcard released the opening track for their album which is called "Awakening". It's available for streaming. The lyric video of the song is now up on YouTube under Hopeless Records. On July 15, the band confirmed that the next single would be called "Here I Am Alive," set to be released July 31. On July 19, they shared some of their thoughts about the album in the form of an online video, which contains also an acoustic version of the title track. On August 7, the full album was made available for streaming on YouTube under Hopeless Records. "Here I Am Alive" music video featuring Tay Jardine premiered on August 14 on MTV.

Ryan Key and Longineu Parsons III performed an acoustic cover of Mumford and Sons' song "I Will Wait" on the first show of Yellowcard's Southern Air tour, and they continued to play it most nights. On December 6, Yellowcard announced that they were back in the studio. Shortly after, on December 10, Yellowcard released the music video for "Awakening" on MTV Buzzworthy. On May 3, 2013, Yellowcard confirmed rumors via Twitter about the recording of an acoustic Ocean Avenue record in honor of the platinum album's 10th anniversary. On June 3, 2013, pre-orders were set up for Ocean Avenue Acoustic. The album was released on August 13, 2013. The band also announced an Ocean Avenue Acoustic tour this fall with special guest Geoff Rickly of Thursday. Yellowcard also performed their song "Paper Walls" live for the first time on the Ocean Avenue Acoustic Tour. On October 29, 2013 Yellowcard announced that they will be releasing a cover of Tony Sly's song called "Already Won" which is included in "The Songs of Tony Sly: A Tribute". They're also involved in a Punk Goes Christmas compilation with their cover of "Christmas Lights" by Coldplay. During January and February 2014, the band took the Ocean Avenue Acoustic tour out for a second leg around the United States in cities that they missed the first time around, with special guests What's Eating Gilbert. At various shows during the tour, and on the members personal social media accounts, the band began stating that they've been writing new music and would be returning to the studio this year. On February 12, 2014, it was announced Yellowcard would be playing the entire 2014 Vans Warped Tour. On March 13, 2014, Yellowcard announced that drummer and founding member Longineu Parsons III, had left the band. Sean Mackin is the only remaining original member of the band.
