   Norwalk is a city located in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates the 2014 population of the city was 88,145. Norwalk also ranks sixth on the List of municipalities of Connecticut by population. The city is part of New York metropolitan area. Norwalk was purchased in 1640 by Roger Ludlow. The original purchase included the land between the Norwalk and Saugatuck rivers, at a distance of a "day’s walk" from the sea. Norwalk was chartered as a town on September 11, 1651. The traditional American song "Yankee Doodle" has Norwalk-related origins, though not written in Norwalk. During the French and Indian War, a regiment of Norwalkers led by Colonel Thomas Fitch arrived at Fort Crailo, NY. The British regiment began to mock and ridicule the rag-tag Connecticut troops, who had only chicken feathers for a uniform. Richard Shuckburgh, a British army surgeon, added words to a popular tune of the time, Lucy Locket (e.g., “stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni”, macaroni being the London slang at the time for a foppish dandy). In 1776, American spy Nathan Hale set out from Norwalk by ship on his ill-fated intelligence-gathering mission. British forces under General William Tryon arrived on July 10, 1779 and almost completely destroyed Norwalk; only six houses were spared. After the Revolutionary War, many residents were compensated for their losses with free land grants in the Connecticut Western Reserve in what is now Ohio; this later became Norwalk, Ohio. In 1849 the New York and New Haven Railroad started operating through Norwalk.  In 1852 the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad connected Norwalk with Danbury. Both railroads eventually became parts of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.  The first major U.S. railroad bridge disaster occurred in Norwalk in 1853 when a train plunged into the Norwalk River. Forty-six deaths and about 30 injuries resulted. Oyster farming in Norwalk peaked from the late 19th century to the early part of the 20th century. By 1880, it had the largest fleet of steam-powered oyster boats in the world. Norwalk was reincorporated as a borough in 1836, then reincorporated as a city in 1893 and was consolidated with the town of Norwalk in 1913. This latter event gave rise to the 1913 year that appears on the seal of the city. In the mid-1970s, the city government and several local organizations started successful efforts to revitalize the South Norwalk business district ("SoNo"). The Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk was founded as part of that effort. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which,  of it is land and  of it (37.24%) is water. Norwalk is composed of approximately 24 neighborhoods: Norwalk is bordered on the east by Westport; on the north by Wilton; on the northwest by New Canaan; on the west by Darien and on the south by Long Island Sound. Norwalk, like the rest of coastal Connecticut lies in the broad transition zone between the cold humid continental climate to the north (Köppen climate classification: Dfa) and the more mild temperate/subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), to the south. Coastal Connecticut, Long Island/NYC, and northern New Jersey are the general dividing line between theses two climate zones. The warm season in Norwalk is from late May through mid October. Warm and often humid weather, with highs in the 80's F and lows in the 60's F are common. Late day thundershowers are common in the hottest months (June, July, August), despite the mostly sunny skies. The cool/cold season is from late November though mid March, with highs near 40 F and lows in the upper 20's F. Winter weather is far more variable than summer weather along the Connecticut coast, ranging from sunny days with high temperatures in the low 50's F, to cold and blustery conditions with occasional snow. Like much of the Connecticut coast and nearby Long Island, NY, some of the winter precipitation is rain or a mix and rain and wet snow in Norwalk. Norwalk averages about 30 inches of snowfall annually (reported at NWS Bridgeport) - about half as much as inland areas of CT and southern New York (Hartford averages 45 inches and Albany averages 61 inches for example). Although infrequent, tropical cyclones (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the Norwalk area. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), 1985 (Gloria). Tropical Storm Irene (2011) also caused moderate damage along the Connecticut coast, as did Hurricane Sandy (which made landfall in New Jersey) in 2012. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where so-called "subtropical indicator" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. Based on NWS (National Weather Service) 30 year data, Norwalk,CT averages 94 days a year with freeze (temperatures of 32 F/0 C or lower)...about the same as Baltimore, MD or Albuquerque, NM.

The WHEELS buses offer extensive service in Norwalk and Westport and the Norwalk Transit District operates services throughout southwestern Connecticut.  The state run Connecticut Transit Coastal Link buses operate through Norwalk as part of the Stamford Division. The Metro-North Railroad's main New Haven and Danbury branch lines both run through Norwalk.  Metro-North provides passenger and commuter service to four stations within the city, with direct connections to New York City, Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven. The South Norwalk owned and operated by the Norwalk Parking Authority (www.norwalkpark.org)  station lies along the main line and is also the southern terminus of the Danbury branch line.  The Rowayton and East Norwalkoperated by the Norwalk Parking Authority Norwalk Parking Authority(www.norwalkpark.org) stations are along the New Haven main line.  The Merritt 7 station lies along the Danbury branch line.  The New Haven line bridge over the Norwalk River is the only four track swing bridge in the nation. The main line comprises a segment along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor though the national passenger railroad does not provide service to Norwalk.  The nearest stations that Amtrak does stop at are Stamford and Bridgeport.  The Connecticut Department of Transportation's Shore Line East passenger service trains also run through Norwalk, though only a few SLE trains stop at South Norwalk station. Shore Line East trains also stop at nearby Stamford and Bridgeport stations. Freight service over the rail lines in Norwalk is provided by CSX Transportation and the Providence and Worcester Railroad.  During the week, over 200 trains a day pass through Norwalk. There is no scheduled air service directly into Norwalk, but there are airports nearby such as LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City; Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey; Westchester County Airport in Westchester County; Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, New York; and Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks (near Hartford) Connecticut. Nearby general aviation airports include Danbury Municipal Airport in Danbury, Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford, and the Tweed New Haven Regional Airport in New Haven. Interstate 95 crosses through Norwalk, and there are several exits within the Norwalk city limits.  The Merritt Parkway also crosses through Norwalk.  Both of these roads are designated to be north/south routes, but through Norwalk, both of them primarily travel east/west.  The major north-south artery is Route 7, which begins at Interstate 95.  There is an exit to the Merritt Parkway, but only southbound towards New York City, as environmental activists have successfully blocked a full interchange between the two arteries.  In northern Norwalk, Route 7 changes from a limited access, divided highway to an ordinary surface road.  Originally, the intent was to build the "Super 7" highway (in a different place than the current Route 7), which would link Interstate 95 with Interstate 84 in Danbury, but environmental groups and slow-growth advocates succeeded in preventing this highway from being built (although the state of Connecticut continues to own the land to build the highway). Other state highways in Norwalk are Route 53, Route 123, and Route 136. The Route 123 bridge over the Norwalk River, which was undergoing being replaced from August 2007 to August 2008, was one of 12 bridges in the southwestern part of the state (including New Haven) with safety inspection ratings so low they are (or were) considered to be in critical condition.Kaplan, Thomas, Martineau, Kim, and Kauffman, Matthew, "12 state bridges are judged to be in critical condition" article in The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, article reprinted from The Hartford Courant, August 5, 2007, pp1, A6 Electricity in most of Norwalk is provided by the Northeast Utilities's Connecticut Light and Power Company division (CL&amp;P).  However, within the second and third taxing districts the taxing districts act as the local electric power utility company.  Residents of those districts are billed by the district.  The districts in turn purchase wholesale power and arrange for its delivery to, and distribution within, the district.  Power lines and meters in East Norwalk, South Norwalk, and parts of Rowayton are maintained by line crews employed by the district and they may be seen driving about in trucks with district logos.  Both the second (SNEW) and third (TTD) district electric departments belong to the six member Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative which pools their wholesale power purchasing to obtain lower rates for customers.  The history of municipal power in Norwalk extends back to the 1890s when Albert A. Winchester was an early and forceful advocate of it.  In 1892 Winchester designed the city of South Norwalk's generating station – remnants of which still lie along Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in South Norwalk in front of the railroad station. The newer power plant on Manressa Island (near the Harbor View neighborhood) does still generate power within the city.  The Manressa generation plant was originally a coal-fired plant but was converted to burn oil.  It was operated up until the early first decade of the 21st century by CL&amp;P but is now operated under contract by another company. In 2004 the third taxing district installed 3 diesel powered generators at the Norden complex on Norden Place that were initially licensed only for emergency power supply. By summer 2008 the generators, with a combined capacity of 6 Megawatts, had been upgraded to allow licensed operation as regular power providers for the grid (not just emergency power). In 2007 and 2008 the construction of the Middletown-Norwalk transmission line disrupted traffic along the Boston Post Road, but the completion of the line is hoped to help CL&amp;P to provide additional power to lower Fairfield County.  In addition a high-voltage undersea line runs from Manressa Island to Long Island to help provide electric power to Long Island Power Authority customers.  In 2008 the city government of Norwalk started initial investigations of whether the city might resume generating power for sale to electricity customers in the city. Natural gas is provided by Northeast Utilities' Yankee Gas subsidiary. Water in most of the city is provided by the Aquarion Water Company from reservoirs in Wilton. In the first and second taxing districts the taxing districts act as the local water utility provider.
