   The term Semitic people or semitic cultures (from the biblical "Shem", ) was a historical term for people or cultures who speak or spoke the Semitic languages.On the use of the terms “(anti-)Semitic” and “(anti-) Zionist” in modern Middle Eastern discourse, Orientalia Suecana LXI Suppl. (2012) by Lutz Eberhard Edzard: "In linguistics context, the term “Semitic” is generally speaking non-controversial... As an ethnic term, “Semitic” should best be avoided these days, in spite of ongoing genetic research (which also is supported by the Israeli scholarly community itself) that tries to scientifically underpin such a concept."Review of "The Canaanites" (1964) by Marvin Pope: "The term “Semitic,” coined by Schlozer in 1781, should be strictly limited to linguistic matters since this is the only area in which a degree of objectivity is attainable. The Semitic languages comprise a fairly distinct linguistic family, a fact appreciated long before the relationship of the Indo-European languages was recognized. The ethnography and ethnology of the various peoples who spoke or still speak Semitic languages or dialects is a much more mixed and confused matter and one over which we have little scientific control." The racial or ethnic use of the term, together with the parallel terms Hamitic and Japhetic, is now obsolete. As language studies are interwoven with cultural studies, the term also came to describe the extended Semitic religions and ethnicities, as well as the history of these varied cultures as associated by close geographic and linguistic distribution."Semite". Merriam-Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary, Eleventh Edition. The region of origin of the reconstructed Proto-Semitic language, ancestral to historical and modern Semitic languages in the Middle East, is still uncertain and much debated. However, a recent Bayesian analysis identified an origin for Semitic languages in the Levant (modern Syria and Lebanon) around 3750 BC with a later single introduction from what is now Southern Arabia into the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia) around 800 BC. Other theories include an origin in either Mesopotamia, the Arabian Peninsula or North Africa. The Semitic language family is also considered a component of the larger Afroasiatic macro-family of languages. Identification of the hypothetical proto-Semitic region of origin is therefore dependent on the larger geographic distributions of the other language families within Afroasiatic, whose origins are also hotly debated. According to Christy G. Turner II, there is an archaeological and physical anthropological reason for a relation between the modern Semitic-speaking populations of the Levant and the Natufians. The earliest positively proven historical attestation of any Semitic people comes from 30th century BC Mesopotamia, with the East Semitic Akkadian-speaking peoples of the Kish civilization, entering the region originally dominated by the non-Semitic Sumerians (who spoke a language isolate). The earliest known Akkadian inscription was found on a bowl at Ur, addressed to the very early pre-Sargonic king Meskiang-nuna of Ur by his queen Gan-saman, who is thought to have been from Akkad. However, some of the names appearing on the Sumerian king list as prehistoric rulers of Kish have been held to indicate a Semitic presence even before this, as early as the 30th or 29th century BC.Andrew George, "Babylonian and Assyrian: A History of Akkadian", In: Postgate, J. N., (ed.), Languages of Iraq, Ancient and Modern. London: British School of Archaeology in Iraq, pp. 31–71 By the mid 3rd millennium BC,Georges Roux&nbsp;— Ancient Iraq many states and cities in Mesopotamia had come to be ruled or dominated by Akkadian-speaking Semites, including Assyria, Eshnunna, Akkad, Kish, Isin, Ur, Uruk, Adab, Nippur, Ekallatum, Nuzi, Akshak, Eridu and Larsa. During this period (c. 27th to 26th century BC), another East Semitic-speaking people, the Eblaites, appear in historical record from northern Syria, founding the state of Ebla, whose language was closely related to the Akkadian of Mesopotamia. The Akkadians, Assyrians and Eblaites were the first Semitic people to use writing, using the Cuneiform script originally developed by the Sumerians c. 3500 BC, with the first writings in Akkadian dating from c. 2800 BC. The last Akkadian inscriptions date from the late 1st century AD, and Cuneiform script in the 2nd century AD, both in Mesopotamia.Adkins 2003, p. 47. Mesopotamia is generally held to be the cradle of civilisation, where writing, the wheel, the first organised nation states and city states arose during the mid 4th millennium BC, and where the first written evidence of Mathematics, Astronomy, Organised religion, Written Law, Astrology and Medicine are to be found. The Sumero-Akkadian states that arose throughout Mesopotamia between c. the 36th century BC and the 24th century BC were the most advanced in the world at the time in terms of engineering, architecture, agriculture, science, medicine, mathematics, astronomy and military technology. Many had highly sophisticated Socioeconomic structures, with the worlds earliest examples of Written Law, together with structurally advanced and complex trading, business and taxation systems, a well structured civil administration, currency and detailed record keeping.Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq Schools and education existed in many states, Mesopotamian religion was highly organised, and astrology was practiced widely. By the time of the Middle Assyrian Empire in the mid 2nd millennium BC, early examples of zoology, botany and landscaping had emerged, and during the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the early to mid 1st millennium BC, the world's first library was built. Mesopotamia was the center of many powerful empires which often dominated the Near East and beyond, including; the Akkadian Empire (2335-2154 BC), Neo-Sumerian Empire (2119-2004 BC), Old Assyrian Empire (2035-1750 BC), Babylonian Empire (1792-1740 BC), Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1020 BC), Neo Assyrian Empire (911-605 BC) and Neo-Babylonian Empire (605-539 BC). All early Semites across the entire Near East appear to have originally been Polytheist. Mesopotamian religion is the earliest recorded and for three millennia was the most influential,Bottéro (2001:Preface) exerting strong influence on the later recorded Canaanite religions then practiced in what is today Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories and the Sinai Peninsula, and also those of the Arameans, Chaldeans, Phoenicians/Carthaginians and Arabs. The influence of Mesopotamian religion can also be found in Armenian, Persian and Graeco-Roman religion and to some degree upon the later Semitic Monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, Mandaeism, Gnosticism and Islam."Assyria". Jewish Encyclopedia.Julian Jaynes (2000). The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Mariner Books. Retrieved 2013-06-16. Some of the most significant of these Mesopotamian deities were Anu, Ea, Enlil, Enki, Ishtar (Astarte), Ashur, Shamash, Shulmanu, Tammuz, Adad (Hadad), Sin (Nanna), Dagan (Dagon), Ninurta, Nisroch, Nergal, Tiamat, Bel, Ninlil, Zababa, Ashurbel and Marduk, many of whom were to find contemporaries throughout the Near East, and to some degree in Asia Minor, the Caucasus, Greece, North Africa and Rome. The Akkadian Empire (2335–2193 BC), arguably the first empire in history, enabled the Mesopotamian Semites to unite all of Mesopotamia under one rule, and further spread their dominance and cultural and technological influence over much of the Near East, Asia Minor (Anatolia) and Ancient Iran. A people known as the Turukku appeared in northwestern Ancient Iran during the Akkadian empire, and appear to have been a synthesis of both Hurrians and East Semites. Of the West Semitic-speaking peoples who occupied what is today Syria (excluding the East Semitic north east), Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, the Palestinian territories and the Sinai peninsula, the earliest references concern the Canaanite-speaking Amorites (known as "Martu" or "Amurru" by the Mesopotamians) of northern and eastern Syria, and date from the 24th century BC in Mesopotamian annals."Amorite (people)". Encyclopædia Britannica online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. Retrieved 30 November 2012 The technologically advanced Sumerians, Akkadians and Assyrians of Mesopotamia mention the West Semitic-speaking peoples in disparaging terms;- The MAR.TU who know no grain...

Babylon became the centre of a short lived but influential Babylonian Empire in the 18th century BC, and subsequent to this southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia, with Babylon superseding the ancient city of Nippur as the primary religious center of southern Mesopotamia. Northern Mesopotamia had long before already coalesced into Assyria. After the fall of the first Babylonian Empire, the far south of Mesopotamia broke away for about 300 years, becoming the independent Sealand Dynasty. In the 19th century BC a similar wave of Canaanite-speaking Semites entered Egypt and by the early 17th century BC these Canaanites (known as Hyksos by the Egyptians) had conquered the country, forming the Fifteenth Dynasty, introducing military technology new to Egypt, such as the war chariot.Lloyd, A.B. (1993). Herodotus, Book II: Commentary, 99–182 v. 3. Brill. p. 76. ISBN 978-90-04-07737-9. Retrieved 23 December 2011. A number of Pre-Arab Semitic states are mentioned as existing (in what was much later to become known as the Arabian Peninsula) in Akkadian and Assyrian records as colonies of these Mesopotamian powers, such as Meluhha and Dilmun (in modern Bahrain). A number of other non-Arab South Semitic states existed in the far south of the peninsula, such as Sheba/Saba (in modern Yemen), Magan and Ubar (both in modern Oman), although the histories of these states is sketchy (mainly coming from Mesopotamian and Egyptian records), as there was no written script in the region at this time.Stein, Peter (2005). "The Ancient South Arabian Minuscule Inscriptions on Wood: A New Genre of Pre-Islamic Epigraphy". Jaarbericht van het Vooraziatisch-Egyptisch Genootschap "Ex Oriente Lux" 39: 181–199. Proto-Canaanite texts from northern Canaan and the Levant (modern Lebanon and Syria) around 1500 BC yield the first undisputed attestations of a written West Semitic language (although earlier testimonies are found in Mesopotamian annals concerning Amorite, and possibly preserved in Middle Bronze Age alphabets, such as the Proto-Sinaitic script from the late 19th century BC), followed by the much more extensive Ugaritic tablets of northern Syria from the late 14th century BC in the city-state of Ugarit in north west Syria. Ugaritic was a West Semitic language, fairly closely related to, and part of the same general language family as the tongues of the Amorites, Canaanites, Phoenicians, Moabites, Edomites and Israelites. The Shasu appear in Egyptian records c. 14th century BC, as a semi-nomadic Canaanite-speaking people inhabiting Moab and northern Edom (a region stretching from the Jezreel Valley to Ashkelon and the Sinai), and a number of scholars believe the Shasu were synonymous with the Hebrews, who went on to eventually found Israel.Redford, Donald B. (1992). Egypt, Canaan and Israel In Ancient Times. Princeton: Princeton University Press. ISBN 0-691-00086-7.Redford (1992), p. 272–73, 275. The appearance of nomadic Semitic Aramaeans and Suteans in historical record also dates from the late 14th century BC, the Arameans coming to dominate an area roughly corresponding with modern Syria (which became known as Aram or Aramea), subsuming the earlier Amorites, and founding states such as Aram-Damascus, Luhuti, Bit Agusi, Hamath, Aram-Naharaim, Paddan-Aram, Aram-Rehob, and Zobah, while the Suteans occupied the deserts of south eastern Syria and north eastern Jordan. A Canaanite group known as the Phoenicians came to dominate the coasts of Syria, Lebanon and south west Turkey from the 13th century BC, founding city states such as Tyre, Sidon, Byblos Simyra, Arwad, Berytus (Beirut), Antioch and Aradus, eventually spreading their influence throughout the Mediterranean, including building colonies in Malta, Sicily, the Iberian peninsula (modern Spain), and the coasts of North Africa, founding the major city state of Carthage (in modern Tunisia) in the 9th century BC. The Phoenicians created the Phoenician alphabet in the 12th century BC, which would eventually supersede Cuneiform. Phoenician became one of the most widely used writing systems, spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world and beyond, where it evolved and was assimilated by many other cultures. The still extant Aramaic alphabet, a modified form of Phoenician script, was the ancestor of modern Hebrew, Syriac/Assyrian and Arab scripts, stylistic variants and descendants of the Aramaic script. The Greek alphabet (and by extension its descendants such as the Latin, the Cyrillic and the Egyptian Coptic scripts), was a direct successor of Phoenician, though certain letter values were changed to represent vowels. Old Italic, Anatolian, Armenian, Georgian and Paleohispanic scripts are also descendant of Phoenician script. Between the 13th and 11th centuries BC, a number of small Canaanite-speaking states arose in Southern Canaan, an area approximately corresponding to modern Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian territories and Sinai Peninsula. These were the lands of the Edomites, Moabites, Hebrews/Israelites/Judaeans/Samaritans, Ammonites and Amalekites, all of whom spoke closely related west Semitic Canaanite languages. Edom and Moab were first to appear in historical record during the mid to late 13th century BC, both coming into conflict with Egypt. The Hebrews (who spoke a Canaanite dialect) make an appearance in historical record, with the founding of the state of Israel in the late 11th century BC in southern Canaan. Later, a part of Israel broke away, becoming Judea, with a further Jewish kingdom Samarra (the land of the Samaritans) also founded as a puppet kingdom by the Assyrians. In Israel the very first example of monotheism gradually evolved with the founding of Judaism and the belief in one single god, Yahweh. The Hebrew language, closely related to the earlier attested Canaanite language of the Phoenicians, would become the vehicle of the religious literature of the Tanakh and Torah, and thus eventually have global ramifications. Alongside and at the same time as the Hebrews/Israelites, another closely related West Semitic/Canaanite nation of Ammon also appeared, often involved in local rivalries with Israel, as did the Amalekites, who did not appear to have a unified state of their own. The Chaldeans (not to be confused with modern Chaldean Catholics), closely related to but distinct from the Arameans, followed the pattern of the earlier arriving Arameans and Suteans, and migrated from The Levant into the far south east of Babylonia c. the late 10th or early 9th century BC, where they settled and rapidly became Akkadianised. The Chaldeans are first historically attested in 852 BC in Assyrian records. The South Semitic Arabs also first appear in record in Assyrian Annals from the mid 9th century BC as desert dwelling nomadic inhabitants of what is today Saudi Arabia. They were regarded as conquered vassals of the Assyrians. Later still, written evidence of Old South Arabian and Ge'ez (both related to but in reality separate languages to the Arabic language) offer the first written attestations of South Semitic languages in the 8th century BC in Sheba, Ubar and Magan (modern Oman and Yemen). These, along with writing in the form of the Ge'ez script, were later imported to the previously non-Semitic-speaking lands of  Ethiopia and Eritrea by migrating South Semites from part of Southern Arabia (modern west Yemen) during the 8th and 7th centuries BC, who after intermingling with the native non-Semitic African peoples, gave rise to Ethiopian Semitic-speaking peoples, whose languages survive to this day. The East Semitic Mesopotamian states of Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia proved to be not only the oldest, but the most advanced in the Near East and its surrounds, between the mid 24th and late 6th centuries BC, often asserting dominance over the West, Northwest and South Semitic-speaking peoples, as well as the Non-Semitic peoples of the region.

Quote: "First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero (1896), the somewhat misleading term "Sea Peoples" encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh, Eqwesh, Denyen, Sikil / Tjekker, Weshesh, and Peleset (Philistines). [Footnote: The modern term "Sea Peoples" refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from "islands" (tables 1-2; Adams and Cohen, this volume; see, e.g., [[Robert Drews|Drews]] 1993, 57 for a summary). The use of quotation marks in association with the term "Sea Peoples" in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation "of the sea" appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill (see, e.g., Sandars 1978; Redford 1992, 243, n. 14; for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature, see Woudhuizen 2006).

After reviewing what the Egyptian texts have to say about 'the sea peoples', one Egyptologist (Wolfgang Helck) recently remarked that although some things are unclear, "eins ist aber sicher: Nach den agyptischen Texten haben wir es nicht mit einer 'Volkerwanderung' zu tun."

[[Nilotic peoples]] such as the [[Nubians]], [[Kushites]] and [[Dinka]] dwelt to the south of the Egyptians, and [[Puntland|Puntites]] to the south east of Ethiopia.  A number of non-Semitic peoples were eventually absorbed by Semites; The [[Sumerians]] were absorbed into the Akkadian-speaking [[Assyro-Babylonian]] population of Mesopotamia by around 2000 BC, and the [[Kassites]] who ruled Babylonia for almost five centuries from the early 16th century BC, eventually blended into the native population. Similarly, the [[Philistines]] eventually disappeared into the native Israelite-Canaanite population, and in northern Aram (Syria) and south central Asia Minor, there was a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and Indo-European [[Neo-Hittite]]s, with the founding of a number of small [[Syro-Hittite]] states from the 12th century BC until their destruction by Assyria in the 8th and 7th centuries BC.  During the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1366-1020 BC) and in particular the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911-605 BC) much of the [[Near East]], Asia Minor, [[Caucasus]], [[Eastern Mediterranean]], Egypt, [[Ancient Iran]] and North Africa fell under Assyrian domination. During the 8th century BC the Assyrian emperor [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] introduced Aramaic as the [[lingua franca]] of their empire, and this language was to remain dominant among Near Eastern Semites until the early [[Medieval period|Medieval Period]]. Mesopotamian cities such as [[Nineveh]], Babylon and [[Ashur]] ([[Assur]]) were the largest in the world during the [[Iron Age]].  The [[Assyrian Empire]] collapsed by 605 BC after decades of internal civil war followed by a combined attack on the weakened state by an alliance of its former subject peoples (their own Babylonian relations, together with the Chaldeans, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]), and after the collapse of the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in 539 BC, the Semitic peoples found themselves largely under the domination of various [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking empires for over twelve centuries; the [[Achaemenid Empire]], [[Seleucid Empire]], [[Parthian Empire]], [[Roman Empire]], [[Sassanid Empire]] and [[Byzantine Empire]].  Babylonia was often erroneously referred to as Chaldea from the period of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] onwards (particularly in Jewish writings), although only the first three or four rulers of the empire were certainly Chaldeans, and the last two rulers were Assyrian. The migrant Chaldeans, like the Amorites, Kassites, Suteans and Arameans of southern Mesopotamia before them, eventually blended into the indigenous population, and wholly disappeared as a distinct people and ethnicity, and Babylonia itself was eventually subsumed into Assyria ([[Assuristan]]) by the [[Sassanid Empire]].  During these periods there were spells of varying degrees of independence from the Indo-European empires. In Israel/Judea, the powerful [[Hasmonean dynasty]] arose, which at its height expanded into Syria, Jordan and the Sinai. Independent states arose among the Assyrians between the 1st century BC and 4th century AD, such as [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Assur]] and [[Hatra]],  with the [[Neo-Assyrian]] state of [[Osroene]] becoming the first independent Christian country in history.  The [[Aramean-Syriac people|Aramean]] state of [[Palmyra]] founded a short lived [[Palmyrene Empire]] based in northern Syria in the 3rd century AD, briefly rivalling [[Rome]]. The [[Nabateans]], an Aramaic-speaking people of mixed Canaanite, Aramean and pre-Islamic Arab origins appear in the 4th century BC around the [[Negev]], Sinai Peninsula and northern Arabia, forming an independent [[Nabatea]] between the 2nd century BC and 2nd century AD, with its capital at [[Petra]]. Most notable was the powerful Phoenician state of Carthage which colonised much of the [[Mediterranean]] coastline, including those of eastern Spain and southern Portugal, southern France, [[Libya]], Tunisia, [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] as well as [[Sicily]], Malta, [[Gibraltar]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]]. For centuries it rivaled the [[Roman Empire]] before being finally destroyed in the 3rd century AD.  The Mandeans, a [[gnostic]] ethno-religious sect venerating [[John the Baptist]] as the true Messiah, appear in the 1st century AD first in Assyria, and then Southern Mesopotamia. Their origins are unclear, but most scholars believe that they are originally a Canaanite or Aramean people originating from around the [[River Jordan]] who mixed with Mesopotamians, while others believe them to be native Mesopotamians.  [[File:Semitic 1st AD.svg|thumb|Approximate distribution of Semitic languages around the 1st century AD]] By the 1st century AD various Aramaic dialects had come to dominate an area stretching from eastern Asia Minor in the north to the northern Arabian Peninsula in the south, and from Assyria, Mesopotamia and north western Persia in the east, to the Eastern coasts of the Mediterranean in the west. [[Aramaic]] inscriptions have also been found as far afield as ancient England and Scotland on and around the region of [[Hadrians Wall]], written by [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Aramean]] soldiers of the Roman army.<ref>http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/oct/13/hadrians-wall</ref>  Particularly Semitic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Mandaeism, [[Sabianism]], [[Manicheanism]] and Gnosticism took root among the Semites, with Judaism long centered in [[Judaea]] (Israel) and Mesopotamia, and Christianity first spread initially among the largely Aramaic-speaking Semitic races of Judaea, Syria, Assyria, Babylonia, Nabatea and Phoenicia during the 1st century AD, an area encompassing the modern states of Israel, Jordan, [[Iraq]], Syria, Lebanon, [[Kuwait]], south eastern Turkey and the Palestinian territories. [[Syriac Christianity]] and the [[Syriac language]] largely originatd and centered in areas outside of Roman control, in Persian-occupied Assyria ([[Athura]]/Assuristan), from whence in the form of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Nestorianism]], it spread to [[The Levant]], [[Central Asia]], India and China. [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]] spread from Egypt to the Ethiopian Semites and to the Nilotic peoples of The Sudan by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. Mandaeism and Sabianism were centered in Assyria and Mesopotamia, and gnostic sects were to be found all over the Semitic world.  With the advent of the [[Arab]] [[Islamic conquest]] of the 7th and 8th centuries AD, the hitherto largely uninfluential [[Arabic language]] (and [[Islamic culture]]) slowly but surely replaced many (but not all) of the indigenous Semitic languages and cultures of the [[Near East]]. Both the Near East and North Africa saw an influx of Muslim Arabic people from the [[Arabian Peninsula]], followed later by non-Semitic Muslim [[Iranic]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples. The previously dominant Aramaic dialects gradually began to be sidelined, however descendant dialects of Aramaic, including [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], survive to this day among the [[Assyrians in Iraq|Assyrians]] (and [[Mandaeans]]) of Northern Iraq, Northwestern Iran, Northeastern Syria and Southeastern Turkey, with the dialects of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] still to this day containing hundreds of Akkadian loanwords and an Akkadian grammatical structure.<ref>Khan 2008, pp. 6</ref>  Long extant Semitic [[geopolitical]] regions such as Judaea, Assyria, Phoenicia, Carthaginia and Syria/Aramea were dissolved by the Arabs.

Patrick Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World''.

A number of South Arabian languages distinct from Arabic still survive, such as [[Soqotri]], [[Mehri]] and [[Shehri language|Shehri]] which are mainly spoken in [[Socotra]], Yemen and Oman, and are likely descendants of the languages spoken in the ancient ''Pre Arab'' and non-Arab kingdoms of [[Sheba]], [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]], [[Iram of the Pillars|Ubar]], [[Meluhha]] and [[Dilmun]].  By the 21st century AD, people identifying as Arabs now make up the largest population of Semites in the Near East, followed by large numbers of non-Semitic [[Berbers]] in North Africa and Ethiopian Semites in the [[Horn of Africa]].  However a significant number of the once dominant indigenous, ancient ''pre-Arab'' and ''pre-Islamic'' Semitic peoples of the [[Middle East]] maintain their identities to this day, including the [[Jews]], [[Copts]], [[Maronites]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]]-[[Arameans]], [[Mandeans]] etc., despite being often persecuted ethnic and religious minorities.  In Israel, the majority population are Hebrew-speaking ethnic [[Jews]], with a tiny minority of Samaritans still extant.  In Iraq and the areas of northeast Syria, northwest Iran and southeast Turkey bordering northern Iraq, the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] (also known theologically as [[Chaldo-Assyrians]]) still maintain their Akkadian-influenced dialects of [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic]] as spoken and written tongues, together with their ancient forms of [[Eastern Christianity]]. In these same areas the Mandaeans retain their distinct ''pre-Arab'' Mandaic language and Gnostic religion.  Among the Syriac Christians and [[Mhallami]] of modern Syria, the advocacy of a pre-Arab [[Arameans (Syriacs)|Aramean]] or [[Syriac-Aramean people|Syriac-Aramean]] identity is still strong, although only tiny minorities now speak their native [[Western Aramaic languages|Western Aramaic]] tongue.  In Lebanon and some coastal regions of Syria the concept of [[Phoenicianism]] is endorsed, particularly by [[Maronite Christians]] who reject Arab identity and instead assert their ethnic roots lie with the ''pre-Arab'' and ''pre-Islamic'' Canaanites and Phoenicians.  ==Ethnicity and race== {{further|Archaeogenetics of the Near East|Caucasian race|Hamitic race|Scientific racism}} [[File:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|This [[T and O map]], from the first printed version of [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'', identifies the three known continents as populated by descendants of Sem ([[Shem]]), Iafeth ([[Japheth]]) and Cham ([[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]]).]] In outdated [[Race (classification of humans)|race classifications]], the Semitic peoples were considered to be of [[Caucasoid]] type, not dissimilar in appearance to the neighbouring [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], [[Berber languages|Berber]] and [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]]-speaking peoples of the region.<ref>The Races of Europe by Carleton Stevens Coon.

A DNA study of Jews and Palestinian Arabs (including Bedouins) found that these were more closely related to both each other than to people of the Arabian peninsula, [[Ethiopian Semites]] ([[Amharic and Tigrean speakers]]), and the Arabic speakers of North Africa.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nebel | first1 = Almut | last2 = Filon | first2 = Dvora | last3 = Brinkmann | first3 = Bernd | last4 = Majumder | first4 = Partha P. | last5 = Faerman | first5 = Marina | last6 = Oppenheim | first6 = Ariella  | year = 2001 | title = The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 69 | issue = 5| pages = 1095–1112 | pmc = 1274378 | pmid=11573163 | doi=10.1086/324070}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alshamali | first1 = Farida | last2 = Pereira | first2 = Luísa | last3 = Budowle | first3 = Bruce | last4 = Poloni | first4 = Estella S. | last5 = Currat | first5 = Mathias  | year = 2009 | title = Local Population Structure in Arabian Peninsula Revealed by Y-STR Diversity | url = http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=000210448 | journal = Hum Hered | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 45–54 | doi=10.1159/000210448 | pmid=19339785}}</ref>  Genetic studies indicate that modern Jews (Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi specifically), Levantine Arabs, Assyrians, Samaritans, Syriacs-Arameans, Maronites, [[Druze]], Mandaeans, and Mhallami, all have an ancient indigenous common Near Eastern heritage which can be genetically mapped back to the ancient Fertile Crescent, but often also display genetic profiles distinct from one another, indicating the different histories of these peoples.<ref>Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Paolo Menozzi, Alberto Piazza, The History and Geography of Human Genes, p. 243</ref>  ==Anti-Semitism and Semiticisation== {{Main|Antisemitism}}  The word "Semite" and most uses of the word "Semitic" relate to any people whose native tongue is, or was historically, a member of the associated [[Semitic languages|language family]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Semite |publisher=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary, Eleventh Edition |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/semite}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Semitic |publisher=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary, Eleventh Edition.

[[Moritz Steinschneider]], in his periodical of Jewish letters ''Hamaskir'' (3 (Berlin 1860), 16), discusses an article by [[Heymann Steinthal]]<ref>Reprinted G. Karpeles (ed.), Steinthal H., ''Ueber Juden und Judentum'', Berlin 1918, pp. 91 ff.</ref> criticising Renan's article "New Considerations on the General Character of the Semitic Peoples, In Particular Their Tendency to Monotheism".<ref>Published in the ''Journal Asiatique'', 1859</ref> Renan had acknowledged the importance of the ancient civilisations of Mesopotamia, Israel etc. but called the Semitic races inferior to the [[Aryan]] for their [[monotheism]], which he held to arise from their supposed lustful, violent, unscrupulous and selfish racial instincts. Steinthal summed up these predispositions as "Semitism", and so Steinschneider characterised Renan's ideas as "anti-Semitic prejudice".<ref>[[Alex Bein]], ''The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 594, ISBN 0-8386-3252-1&nbsp;– quoting the Hebrew Encyclopaedia ''Ozar Ysrael'', (edited Jehuda Eisenstadt, London 1924, 2: 130ff)</ref>  In 1879 the German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]], in a pamphlet called ''Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum'' ("The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism"), began the politicisation of the term by speaking of a struggle between Jews and Germans. He accused them of being liberals, a people without roots who had Judaized Germans beyond salvation. In 1879 Marr's adherents founded the "League for Anti-Semitism"<ref>Moshe Zimmermann, ''Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Anti-Semitism'', Oxford University Press, USA, 1987</ref> which concerned itself entirely with anti-Jewish political action.  ==See also== * [[Afroasiatic languages]] * [[Battakhin]] * [[Hamitic]] * [[Japhetic]] * [[Proto-Semitic language]] * [[Proto-Sinaitic script]] * [[Sons of Noah]]  ==References== {{reflist|colwidth=30em}}  ==External links== {{NIE Poster|year=1905|Semites}} {{Commons category|Semitic peoples}} *[http://foundationstone.com.au/HtmlSupport/WebPage/semiticGenetics.html Semitic genetics] *[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=89998 Semitic language family tree] included under "Afro-Asiatic" in SIL's [http://www.ethnologue.com/web.asp Ethnologue]. *[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=1062-0516%28192310%2940%3A1%3C1%3AAO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-E&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage The south Arabian origin of ancient Arabs] *[http://nabataea.net/edomch5.html The Edomite Hyksos connection] *[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-5491(199507)68%3A3%3C139%3AMASHTG%3E2.0.CO%3B2-E The perished Arabs] *[http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/m/midianites.html The Midianites of the north] *[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX3bgPE39o Ancient Semitic peoples (video)]  {{Semitic topics}} {{Semitic languages}} {{Sons of Noah}}  [[Category:Semitic peoples| ]] [[Category:Historical definitions of race]] [[Category:Islam and Judaism]] [[Category:Shem]]  [[la:Semitae]]
