   The Dodge Caravan is a passenger minivan manufactured by Dodge. Introduced for model year 1984 and now in its fifth generation, the Caravan has been offered in short-wheelbase (1984–2007) and long-wheelbase (1987–present) variants, the latter as the Grand Caravan. The Grand Caravan is the sibling vehicle of the Chrysler Town & Country. Noted as a pioneering example of the minivan configuration, the Caravan has been manufactured and marketed worldwide alongside rebadged variants: the Plymouth Voyager (1984–2001), Chrysler Voyager (1988–2014), Chrysler Town & Country (1989–2016), Chrysler Grand Voyager, Lancia Voyager (2011-2015), and Volkswagen Routan (2008–2012)&nbsp;– selling more than 11 million combined, worldwide. These minivans played an instrumental role in Chrysler's 1980's survival and survived Chrysler's 1990's merger with Daimler. The Town & Country is being discontinued in 2016 and replaced by the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica while the Grand Caravan will continue to be produced alongside the Pacifica for an unspecified period of time. Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan minivan alongside its badge engineered variant, the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, using an extended derivative of the Chrysler K platform, the Chrysler S platform. Chrysler followed with a long wheelbase (LWB) model, the Grand Caravan in 1987, also based on the Chrysler S platform. Lee Iacocca and Hal Sperlich had conceived their idea for this type of vehicle during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company. Henry Ford II rejected the idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974. Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler Corporation, and together they created what was internally designated the T-115 minivan – a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known in initial marketing as the "Magic-wagons". The Chrysler minivans launched a few months ahead of the Renault Espace (the first MPV/minivan in Europe, initially presented to executives as a Talbot in 1979, but not launched until 1984), making them the first of their kind – effectively creating the modern minivan segment in the U.S. The original Matra design for the Renault Espace was created when Matra was owned by Chrysler Corporation, so Chrysler may also be credited with originating the minivan concept in Europe as well. Since their introduction in the fall of 1983, the Chrysler minivans have outsold other minivans in the United States, with over 13 million Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth minivans in over 80 countries sold as of October 2008. Only recently has Chrysler ceded the top-selling minivan spot to the Honda Odyssey, if Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country sales are considered separately. Generation I Caravans used Chrysler's S platform, closely related to the K-platform, in three trim levels: base, mainstream SE, and LE. Beginning with model year 1987, all trim levels were also available in a long wheelbase variant (LWB), marketed as the Grand Caravan, which allowed more cargo space behind the rear seat. Interior trim, controls, and instrumentation were borrowed from the K-car, and coupled with the lower floor enabled by the front-wheel-drive, the Caravan featured car-like ease of entry. Base vans came equipped for five passengers in two rows of seating. The LE came with 7 passengers standard in three rows of seating. The base van had two bucket seats with attached armrests and open floor space between them in the front, a 3-person bench seat in the second row. The 7 passenger came with two bucket seats with attached armrests and open floor space between them in the front, a 2-person bench seat in the second row, and a 3-person bench seat in the back row. The two bench seats in the rear were independently removable, and the large 3 person bench could also be installed in the 2nd row location via a second set of attachment points on the van's floor, ordinarily hidden with snap-in plastic covers. This configuration allowed for conventional 5 person seating with a sizable cargo area in the rear. The latching mechanisms for the benches were easy to operate though removing and replacing the seats typically required 2 adults. A front low-back 60/40 split bench, accommodating a third front passenger in the middle, was offered in the SE trim level in 1985 only, allowing for a maximum of 8 passengers.This configuration was subsequently dropped. Safety features consisted of 3-point seat belts for the front two passengers, with simple lap belts for the rear 5. Seats on base models and cloth-trimmed SEs had no headrests, which were not mandated due to the van's "light truck" legal status. However, the two front seats were equipped with non-adjustable headrests on the LE model and in conjunction with vinyl upholstery on the SE. Side-impact reinforcements were mandated, and were at all seating positions front and rear. Neither Airbags nor ABS were available. Access to the rear rows of seating was by a large passenger-side sliding door enabling easy access in confined situations, e.g., parking. Because only one sliding door was offered, the smaller 2nd row bench seat was shifted to the drivers side of the van, facilitating passenger access to the 3rd row seat. To facilitate variable cargo storage behind the rear seat, the seat could be adjusted forward in 2 increments, the first of which removed roughly  of legroom from the back row passengers, and the second of which would push the bench all the way to the back of the 2nd row, making the seats unusable. The seat back of the rear bench could also be folded forward, providing a flat cargo shelf. The smaller 2nd row bench was not adjustable, nor foldable; it could only be removed entirely. Cargo access to the rear was via a hatchback, similar to the one on the K-Car station wagons. The hatch was hinged at the top and held open by gas struts. A cargo version of the Caravan, called the Mini Ram Van, was also introduced in 1984, renamed the Caravan C/V for 1989 and discontinued after 1995. It was available either with the short- or long-wheelbase models. Unique to the Caravan C/V was the option of either having the traditional hatch door in the back or the optional swing-out bi-parting doors (with or without windows), similar to those of more traditional cargo vans. These doors were made of fiberglass and required the C/V vans to be "drop shipped", as these doors were custom installed by another vendor. Also based on the Mini Ram and C/V were aftermarket conversion vans sold through official Chrysler dealers and from the conversion companies themselves. 1984–1986 Dodge Mini Ram Van (conversion) 1987–1990 Dodge Caravan 1987–1988 Dodge Mini Ram Van 1989–1990 Dodge Caravan C/V Both a three-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission and a five-speed manual were available with all inline-4 engines, including the turbocharged 2.5 L (this was a rare combination). The Plymouth Voyager, which was a rebadged version of the Caravan, was also available with a manual transmission. The Chrysler Town & Country, which was a more luxurious repackaged version of the Caravan, had no manual transmission option. Manual transmissions were not available on V6 or long wheelbase models of the passenger Caravan, but was an option on the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V's long wheelbase models with a 3.0 L V6. V-6 engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated TorqueFlite, until the computer controlled Ultradrive 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The Ultradrive offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the inline-4 engine. However, it suffered from reliability problems, usually stemming from what is known as "gear hunt" or "shift busyness", resulting in premature wear of the internal clutches. It also required an uncommon type of automatic transmission fluid and is not clearly labeled as such, leading many owners to use the more common Dexron II rather than the specified "Mopar ATF+3", resulting in transmission damage and eventual failure. The Ultradrive received numerous design changes in subsequent model years to improve reliability, and many early model transmissions would eventually be retrofitted or replaced with the updated versions by dealers, under warranty. These efforts were mostly successful, and most first-generation Caravans eventually got an updated transmission. For the first three years of production, two engines were offered in the Caravan&nbsp;– both inline-4 engines with 2 barrel carburetors. The base 2.2L was borrowed from the Chrysler K-cars, and produced  horsepower. The higher performance fuel-injected version of the 2.2L engine later offered in the Chrysler K-cars was never offered in the Caravan, and the 2-bbl version would remain the base power plant until mid-1987. Alongside the 2.2L, an optional Mitsubishi 2.6L engine was available producing  horsepower. In mid-1987, the base 2.2L I4 was replaced with a fuel-injected 2.5L I4, which produced a respectable , while the Mitsubishi G54B I4 was replaced with the new fuel-injected 3.0L Mitsubishi V-6 producing .  Shortly thereafter in model year 1989, a more powerful engine became optional, with a turbocharged version of the base 2.5L producing . Revisions to the Mitsubishi V-6 upped its output to  that same year, and in 1990 a new  3.3 L V-6 was added to the option list. The V6 engines became popular as sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled and it was dropped at the end of the year. In these years, the ES model debuted (short wheelbase only) to highlight the new engines, the turbo 2.5 in particular. The ES was introduced to the long wheelbase Grand Caravan for 1991 and continued throughout 2003, before it was discontinued and replaced with the SXT.   From 1991 through 1995, the Caravan used the Chrysler AS platform; they were the last minivans derived from the Chrysler K platform. The increasing popularity of the short wheelbase Caravan had a dramatic effect on the captive import from Mitsubishi, called the Dodge Colt Vista, and was no longer imported to North America starting in 1991. This generation of vans brought additional innovations, such as: Changes for this generation included revised trim for 1992, including roof-racks and doorhandles, among other components (prior to this, said components were largely like those found on the previous generation). 1993 marked the final year for optional woodgrain and wire wheels on higher level models. 1994 saw a redesigned interior, with slightly different seat contours/fabrics, along with a new dash, in order to accommodate a passenger-side air bag. 1994 also saw exterior trim changes, such as a body colored grill and moldings on certain models, as well as the addition of a one-year only "10th Anniversary Edition" model. Available as an option on a mid-level Caravan and Grand Caravan (also offered on Voyager models as well), the popular "10th Anniversary" package featured 2-tone paint schemes, which included a contrasting light gray colored lower break, along with a gold fender badge. Only select colors were available on this model. With Generation III, the Chrysler minivans were available in long- and short– wheelbase models; three- and four-door configurations; and eight different powertrains, including electric and compressed natural gas; on a single, flexible platform. In development for nearly 5 years from early 1990 (full development from 1991) to December 26, 1994 (final design by Don Renkert was approved on September 23, 1991 and frozen in May 1992), the 1996 model was introduced on January 4, 1995 at the 1995 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) using the Chrysler NS platform. It included a number of innovations, including a driver's side sliding door (optional initially, to become standard equipment later), a first for Chrysler and a non-compact minivan for the United States & Canada (the Honda Odyssey had introduced the first four-door non-compact minivan for the United States & Canada in 1994, although the first-generation Odyssey had conventional hinged rear doors). With Generation III, Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as Easy Out Roller Seats. A conventional door handle and lock was added to the rear hatch, eliminating the confusing pop-and-lift maneuver which had been required on earlier models. Base models of the Caravan were offered in most states with either a 2.4 L four-cylinder or the 3.0 L Mitsubishi V6, except in several northeastern states, where the Mitsubishi V6 didn't meet emissions standards. In those locales, the 3.3 L engine was offered as the V6 option from 1997 through 2000. The rarely-ordered manual transmission was dropped a few months into the 1996 model year and only a handful of vans were equipped with them. The 2.4 L four-cylinder engine produced more power than the Mitsubishi 3.0 had in the first two generations. The 1996 Caravan, along with the Plymouth Voyager and the Chrysler Town & Country won the North American Car of the Year award. The Caravan itself won Motor Trend magazine's Car of the Year 1996 and appeared on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1996 and 1997. 1999 also saw the addition of a one-year only 15th anniversary "Platinum Edition", to mark Caravan's 15th year of production. This package was offered on various trim levels, and included Platinum Metallic paint, and fender badges. The 2000 model year offered packages which included the "2000+" and "Millennium" package, however these were little more than unique fender badges on vans with popular equipment. In 1998, the 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan got new front styling on all trims above SE, and Sport and ES models received even sportier styling. The ES model was the first minivan to receive the "AutoStick" transmission and 17&nbsp;inch wheels. A cargo net between the driver and front passenger seats was added. Some other changes during this generation included new colors, and interior fabric. Color keyed door and lift-gate handles were standard across the whole range, in addition to a new keyless entry remote. Base and SE models had options for a spoiler as well as color keyed bumpers and trim (grey or color molded bumpers and trim were standard). The driver's side sliding door became standard. Chrysler had updates of the Plymouth Voyager in 1996 for the 1997 model year and the Chrysler Town & Country in 1997 for the 1998 model year, prior to the 1998–2007 DaimlerChrysler era; it was the only exterior update of the NS Dodge Caravan. Other plans for this model year included three minivan concepts all to be made in the Windsor Assembly, the Dodge Caravan R/T, Voyager XG, and the Chrysler Pacifica. The Caravan R/T (originally ESS) was to include the most powerful engine ever for a minivan, rated at . It had two Dodge Viper hoodscoops, a brushed aluminum instrument panel, racing-style pedals, and black and white rubber flooring. The Voyager XG was more rugged, and included many outdoor amenities, such as a built-in ice pack. The Chrysler Pacifica, based on the Town & Country, was more luxurious, had power leather seats and footrests, overhead bins and lighting, an LHS grille, and roof-long skylights. The skylight feature was used by Nissan in the Quest. The Pacifica actually did come to be in 2004, based on the fifth generation Caravan, except that it became a crossover SUV rather than a minivan.  In 1999, Dodge introduced the Caravan EPIC, a fully electric minivan. The EPIC was powered by 28 12-volt NiMH batteries and was capable of traveling up to  on a single charge. The EPIC was sold as a fleet-only lease vehicle. Production of the EPIC was discontinued in 2001. Only a few hundred of these vehicles were produced and sold. After the leases expired they were returned and crushed. Approximately 10 vans remain in private hands today. The 1996–2000 Dodge Grand Caravan received a "Marginal" rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's 40&nbsp;mph offset test. The structural performance and restraints were graded "Acceptable", but the foot injuries were very high. In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.  Unveiled at the 2000 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) on Monday, January 10, 2000, the redesigned 2001 Dodge Caravan and 2001 Chrysler Town&Country were released for sale in August 2000. The release was part of a promotional tie-in with Nabisco, which unveiled their new "Mini Oreos" inside the van during the unveiling. The first vans rolled off the line at the Windsor Assembly Plant on July 24. The fourth generation vans were available in the trim levels; SE, Sport, SXT, AWD Sports, "base" model, AWD Choice, eL, C/V, ES, EX, AWD Wagon, and SXT All-Wheel-Drive. In development from February 1996 to December 1999, the Generation IV minivans were based on the Chrysler RS platform and featured a larger body frame with modified headlights and taillights. Design work was done by Brandon Faurote from January 1997 and reached production approval in 1998. In addition to other detailed changes, power sliding doors and a power hatch became available as options. The Mitsubishi 3.0 L V6, which no longer met emissions standards in California and the northeastern U.S., was discontinued, and a more powerful 3.8L engine, based on the 3.3L, became available. All Wheel Drive continued to be offered on high end models. Other innovative available features included remote operated sliding doors and rear hatch, which could be opened and closed at the push of a button, either inside the vehicle, or with the keyless entry fob. In the 2002 model year, DaimlerChrysler stopped using the "DODGE" badges on the front doors, like with all Dodge vehicles. In 2003, the Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V returned after having been discontinued in 1995. The C/V featured the option of deleted side windows (replaced by composite panels), optional rear seats, a cargo floor made of plastic material similar to pickup truck bedliners, rubber flooring in lieu of carpeting and normal hatch at the rear. Minor changes were made to the Grand Caravan ES including many of the features included in Option Group 29S becoming standard, the 17&nbsp;inch Titan Chrome wheels no longer being an option replaced with standard 16&nbsp;inch chrome wheels, and the disappearance of the AutoStick Transmission option. This year also saw the appearance of an optional factory-installed rear seat DVD system with single disc player mounted below the HVAC controls. 2004 offered an exclusive one year only "Anniversary Edition" package to mark Caravan's 20th year in production. This package was offered on higher level SXT models, and included chrome wheels, body color moldings, special interior accents and a unique fender badge. 2005 changes to the Caravan included a revised grille, new foglight fascia, and a system of in-floor folding second and third row seats, marketed as Stow 'n Go seating. Production of this generation continued in China from 2008, when toolings for Dodge fascias and trims were added to the Chrysler Grand Voyager production line, until about 2011 when the fifth generation Chrysler Voyager was introduced for that market. The Caravan was subsequently replaced by the Journey, although a page for the Caravan still exists on the Dodge China site. The Soueast-built Caravan shares its headlights and tail lights with the Chrysler Grand Voyager, rather than the US Caravan. In Canada, the 3.3 L V6 was standard on all models. The 2001 model of this version earned a "Poor" rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 's 40&nbsp;mph offset test. It did protect its occupants reasonably well, and the dummy movement was well controlled, however, a fuel leak occurred. Chrysler corrected this problem starting with the 2002 models, moving it up to an "Acceptable" rating. The 2006 model year brought optional side curtain airbags and a stronger B-pillar, which was tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's side impact crash test. With the side airbags, it got an "Acceptable" rating. For the driver, there is a chance of serious neck injuries, rib fractures and/or internal organ injuries. The rear passengers, however, could leave this accident unharmed, as there is a low risk of significant injury in a crash of this severity for them. The fifth generation van debuted at the 2007 North American International Auto Show with exterior styling by Ralph Gilles. Beginning with Generation V in model year 2008, Chrysler only made the long wheelbase Grand Caravan. With discontinuation of the short-wheelbase Caravan, Dodge offered the Journey on nearly an identical wheelbase and as a crossover rather than a minivan. Although the SWB model, which had accounted for half of all sales in Canada, cost approximately $2,000 less and offered a four-cylinder engine option with improved fuel economy, Chrysler executives stated the SWB Caravan was discontinued to accommodate new features offered in the Grand Caravan, consistent with the demands of the majority of the minivan market. A new six-speed automatic transmission became standard with the 3.8 L V6 and the new 4.0 L V6. The four-speed automatic transmission is standard with the 3.3 L Flex-Fuel V6. This generation of Grand Caravan and its Town & Country counterpart were not available with an all-wheel-drive system. Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as Swivel'n Go seating, the MyGIG entertainment system (a stereo with built in hard drive for recording, storing, and playing music), second and third row video screens, powered second row windows, standard side curtain airbags, and dashboard-mounted transmission controls. The gear shift lever moved to the instrument panel, the location used by competitors. The market shifted briefly away from minivans and SUVs with the gasoline price spikes of the earlier part of 2008. This trend began to reverse itself towards the fall of 2008. In 2009 and 2010 the Dodge Grand Caravan continued to be the top selling minivan in Canada, with over 60% of the market's monthly sales. A noticeable cosmetic update in the 2009 model year saw a "DODGE" badge added to the left side of trunk lid (in the spot where "GRAND CARAVAN" was previously), while "GRAND CARAVAN" had been moved to the right. Badges denoting the engine type ("CRD" for the 2.8 diesel, "FLEXFUEL" for the 3.3, and "4.0L" for the 4.0), previously on the right of the tailgate, was moved to be under the "DODGE" badge. This update also applied to the Grand Voyager and Town & Country. The previously unavailable Electronic Stability Control was made standard on this generation. Both the 3.8 L and 4.0 L engines were paired with Chrysler's 62TE 6-speed automatic transmission with variable line pressure (VLP) technology (See Ultradrive#62TE). In Canada (2008–2010) the 3.3 L was the standard engine across the range, combined with the 4-speed 41TE automatic transmission. The 4.0 L engine and six-speed combination was available as an option on only the top of the range SXT models. In 2011 the six-speed transmission was specified as standard on the Town & Country. In the U.S. the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) New Car Assessment Program crash testing, the 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan achieved a five star (top safety) rating in several categories.  The Grand Caravan underwent a mid-cycle refresh for the 2011 model year, which included major changes in both styling and functionality. The suspension was heavily re-tuned, with both Dodge and Chrysler minivans gaining a larger front sway bar and new rear sway bar, increased rear roll center height, adjusted spring rates, a new steering gear, a revised front static camber setting, and lowered ride height. This dramatically improved handling in the both the Chrysler and Dodge. All three of the former engine choices were replaced by the new Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 with six-speed automatic transmission, now the sole powertrain choice for all models. Interior trim was restyled on both vans, in addition to major exterior revisions highlighted by the new "double-crosshair" grille on the Grand Caravan and a new chrome grille for the Town & Country. Other changes included extra sound insulation, acoustic glass, new seats, softer-touch surfaces, new LED ambient lighting and center console, and halogen projector headlamps with LED accents. The Chrysler models were adjusted so that instead of competing against equivalent Dodge trim levels, they were above Dodge in trim and features. For 2012, a new, basic style trim called "AVP" was introduced, while some features previously unavailable for "SE" (like touch navigation panel) become available as options (The "SE" now also received a floor console, similar to the one available for "SXT"). The same year, the front logo design was changed the two slanted rectangles in red to match the rest of the Dodge lineup. For 2013, the "AVP" trim starting MSRP reduced by $1,000 from the year before.  For the 2014 model year, three new packages are introduced: American Value Package (US; Canada Value Package in Canada), Blacktop package (US only) and the 30th Anniversary Edition. They are all different sets of the SE and SXT trims, and include new luxury features for basically the same price. The Grand Caravan AVP also gained easy-clean floor mats that came with the optional second-row Stow'n Go seats (standard on SE, SXT and R/T). The "Blacktop package", based on SE and SXT, came equipped with 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with gloss black pockets, a gloss black grille, black headlamp bezels, an all-black interior including headliner, door panels and console, unique black cloth seats and door trim panels with silver accent stitching, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with silver accent stitching and a leather shift knob, choice of 6 body colors (Granite Crystal, Billet Silver, Brilliant Black, Maximum Steel, Redline Red, Bright White). SXT models also include fog lamps. The "SE 30th Anniversary Edition", based on the SE trim, came equipped with 17-inch satin carbon aluminum wheels, body-color heated exterior mirrors, 30th Anniversary badging on the front fenders, silver accent stitching and piano black accents throughout, black cloth seats, a black leather-wrapped steering wheel, black leather-wrapped shift knob, black headliner and overhead console, bright heating and air conditioning trim bezels, power second- and third-row windows, and 30th Anniversary logo on the key fob The "SXT 30th Anniversary Edition", based on the SXT trim, was packaged with 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with satin carbon pockets, bright chrome roof rack, bright window trim moldings, fog lamps, automatic headlamps and special 30th Anniversary badging, Black Torino leatherette seats with premium suede inserts and silver accent stitching, power 10-way driver's seat, piano black accent trim bezels, and bright chrome accents throughout. Both 30th Anniversary Editions included an available special body color, Granite Crystal Pearl Coat, a customized gauge cluster with 30th Anniversary badging, as well as the UConnect Handsfree Group (SiriusXM Satellite Radio with a one-year subscription, Bluetooth streaming audio and voice command and an auto-dimming rear view mirror). The vehicles arrived at dealerships at Q3 2013. Also new for the 2014 model year, the Grand Caravan R/T gained standard auto headlamps with black bezels and the Security Group featuring remote start and security alarm. FCA US unveiled the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica at the 2016 North American International Auto Show, which will succeed both the Caravan and Town & Country. Production of the 2016 Grand Caravan will continue into the 2017 model year, unchanged, until production is eventually wound down. A Dodge spokesperson originally stated that the Grand Caravan would cease production within 2016. Automotive news reported that, from January to October in 2010, Dodge sold about a third of its 2010 Grand Caravans to rental fleets. The number of returned ex-rental 2010 Grand Caravan to the market jumped four folds between July to October, depressing prices of used 2009 and 2010 Dodge minivans by as much as 20%. Originally from 2007 to June 1, 2011, the van was known in Europe as the Chrysler G. Voyager, but since June 1, 2011, it has been known in the UK and Ireland as a Chrysler G. Voyager and in the rest of Europe as a Lancia Voyager. For the European market, the Lancia/Chrysler Voyager will be available in three trim levels (Silver, Gold and Platinum) and two choices of engine: a  3.6-liter V6 petrol unit and a 2.8-liter CRD diesel with particulate filter as standard delivering  and . For more information on the European specification Voyager, see Chrysler Voyager. The Ram Cargo Tradesman, or Ram C/V Tradesman, debuted for the 2012 model year, replacing the Dodge Grand Caravan C/V. It is based on the Dodge Grand Caravan, but with solid metal instead of rear windows and a flat load space with  of interior storage, and a . cargo payload plus a towing capability of up to . The Ram C/V is offered with a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. Beginning with Generation V, Volkswagen began marketing the Routan, a rebadged variant of the Chrysler RT platform minivan with revised styling and content, for the North American market. The Routan, made at Windsor Assembly alongside the Grand Caravan, debuted in 2008 at the Chicago Auto Show. Sales began in autumn of 2008, and features neither Chrysler's Stow'n Go nor Swivel'n Go seating systems. Total sales as of September 2010 were reported as being under 10,000 units, far lower than the target of 5% of the minivan market. As a result, in 2012, the Routan was discontinued in Mexico and the US. In Canada, however, the last 2012 models were sold as both 2013 and, later, refurbished 2014 models. The last Routan shipment occurred in Quebec as recently as in April 2014. The Dodge Caravan has incorporated various seating systems for their minivans to enhance interior flexibility. In 1991, Dodge introduced a second row bench seat integrating two child booster seats on 1992 models. These seats continued as an available option through Generation V until they were discontinued in 2010. In 1995, Dodge introduced a system of seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning, marketed as Easy-Out Roller Seats. When installed, the seats are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks have locator depressions for rollers, to simplify installation. Ergonomic levers at the seat backs release the floor latches single-handedly, without tools, and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seat backs were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter. When configured as two and three person benches (available through Generation IV), the Easy Out Roller Seats could be unwieldy. Beginning in 2000, second and third row seats became available in a 'quad' configuration – bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third row three-person 50/50 split "bench"&nbsp;– with each section weighing under . The Easy-out system remained in use through Generation V – where certain models featured a two-person bench and the under-floor compartments from the Stow'n Go system. All the rebadged nameplate variants of the Chrysler minivans use the Easy Out Roller Seats on their second row seating, where not the Stow and Go system. In 2004, Dodge introduced a system of second- and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments. It was marketed as Stow 'N Go and was available exclusively on long-wheelbase models. In a development program costing $400 million, engineers initially used an Erector Set to visualize the complex interaction of the design and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and rear suspension but precluded all-wheel drive (AWD). The system, in turn, creates a combined volume of  of under-floor storage when second-row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat-load floor and a maximum cargo volume of . The Stow 'n Go system received the Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 award, and was never offered on the Volkswagen Routan, the rebadged nameplate variant of the Chrysler minivans. For model year 2011 Chrysler revised the system, rebranding it as "Super Stow 'n Go". New pivoting head restraints with taller seatbacks and a revised folding mechanism (marketed as "single action") improved stowage ease&nbsp;– with the head restraints folding on themselves automatically and the entire seat automatically folding down to a position just over its floor recess. Dodge introduced a seating system in 2007, marketed as Swivel 'n Go. In the seating system, two full size second row seats swivel to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third row seats. The Swivel 'n Go seating system includes the 3rd row seating from the Stow 'n Go system. The system is offered on the Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country, but not the Volkswagen Routan, a rebadged nameplate variant of the Chrysler minivans. These Swivel 'n Go Seats are manufactured by Intier Corp. a division of Magna. The tracks, risers and swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide, a division of Intier. The swivel mechanism was designed by and is produced by Toyo Seat USA Corp. The system is noted for its high strength. The entire load of the seat in the event of a crash is transferred through the swivel mechanism, which is almost twice as strong as the minimum government requirement. The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position. When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation. The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it, although this will not damage the swivel mechanism. "Swivel 'n Go" was dropped after the 2010 model year and is no longer an option on 2011 and later Chrysler and Dodge vans. However, the seats can still be installed by modifying the van with a few basic tools and parts. However, it is impossible to install the table. The long-wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan with Stow 'n Go seats are built in Windsor, Ontario, Canada at Windsor Assembly (WAP Plant 3) by members of Canadian Auto Workers Local 444. Both wheelbase models were produced in Fenton, Missouri at Saint Louis Assembly by members of the United Auto Workers Local 110 until the end of October 2010.
