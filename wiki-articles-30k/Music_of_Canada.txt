  The music of Canada has reflected the diverse influences that have shaped the country. Aboriginals, the Irish, British, and the French have all made unique contributions to the musical heritage of Canada. The music has subsequently been heavily influenced by American culture because of its proximity and migration between the two countries. Since French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1605 and established the first permanent Canadian settlements at Port Royal and Quebec City in 1608, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles. Canada's music industry is the sixth largest in the world producing many internationally renowned artists. Canada has developed a music infrastructure, that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, television music video channels. Canada's music broadcasting is regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences administers Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards, which commenced in 1970.  For thousands of years, Canada was inhabited by Aboriginal peoples from a variety of different cultures and of several major linguistic groupings. Each of the aboriginal communities had (and have) their own unique musical traditions. Chanting - singing is widely popular and most use a variety of musical instruments. They used the materials at hand to make their instruments for thousands of years before Europeans immigrated to the new world. They made gourds and animal horns into rattles, many rattles were elaborately carved and beautifully painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birchbark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood.  Drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs and led to aboriginal dances.  For many years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations and Inuit peoples were discouraged from practicing their traditional ceremonies. In 1606–1607 Marc Lescarbot collected the earliest extant transcriptions of a songs from the Americas: three songs of Henri Membertou, the sakmow (Grand Chief) of the Mi'kmaq First Nations tribe situated near Port Royal, present-day Nova Scotia.   French settlers and explorers to New France brought with them a great love of song, dance and fiddle playing. Beginning in the 1630s French and Aboriginal  children at Quebec City were taught to sing and play European instruments, like viols, violins, guitars, transverse flutes, drums, fifes and trumpets.  Ecole des Ursulines and The Ursuline Convent are among North America's oldest schools and the first institutions of learning for women in North America. both were founded in 1639 by French nun Marie of the Incarnation (1599–1672) alongside the laywoman Marie-Madeline de Chauvigny de la Peltrie (1603–1671) and are the first Canadian institutions to have music as part of the curriculum.New Catholic encyclopedia. editors, Thomas Carson, Joann Cerrito - Washington, D.C. Catholic University of America.(ISBN 0-7876-4004-2) The earliest written record of violins in Canada comes from the Jesuit Relation of 1645. The Jesuits additionally have the first documented organ sale, imported for their Quebec City chapel in 1657. Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral build in 1647  is the primate church of Canada and seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec. It is the oldest Catholic "Episcopal see" in the New World north of Mexico and site of  the first documented choir in Canada.Music in Canada: Capturing Landscape and Diversity. by Elaine Keillor.

Louis Jolliet (1645–1700) is  on  record  as one of the first classically trained  practicing musicians in New France, although history has recognized him  more as an explorer, hydrographer and voyageur. Jolliet is said to have played  the organ,  harpsichord, flute, and trumpet. 1700, under British rule at this time, an organ was installed in Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal and  military bands gave concerts on the Champ de Mars. A French-born priest, René Ménard, composed motets around 1640, and a second Canadian-born priest, Charles-Amador Martin, is credited with the plainchant music for the  Sacrae familiae felix spectaculum, in celebration of the Holy Family feast day in 1700.   Historically,  music was  composed in  Canada's colonies and settlements  during the 18th century, although very few popular named works have survived or were even published. The French and Indian Wars began and left the population economically drained and ill-equipped to develop cultural pursuits properly. The part-time composers of this period were nonetheless often quite skilled. Traditional songs and dances, such as those of the Habitants and Métis, were transmitted orally, from generation to generation and from village to village, thus  people felt no need to transcribe or publish them.Contemporary Canadian Composers. ed. by Keith MacMillan and John Beckwith.

Operatic excerpts began to appear, and before the end of the century Canada had its first home-grown grand opera.

Canada's first wildly published sheet music are two  operas  written in late 18th century  by New France composer, poet, and playwright Joseph Quesnel (1746–1809). The instrument   of favor  for the  lower-class was the  fiddle.  Fiddlers  were a fixture in most public drinking establishments. God Save the Queen has been sung in Canada  since British rule and by the mid-20th century was, along with "O Canada", one of the country's two de facto national anthems.  The beginning  of the 19th century  Canadian musical ensembles had started  forming in great numbers, writing waltzes, quadrilles, polkas and galops. The first volumes of music printed in  the Canadas was the "Graduel romain" in 1800 followed by the  "Processional 'sic' romain" in 1801. Folk music  was still thriving,  as recounted  in the poem titled "A Canadian Boat Song".  The poem was composed by the Irish poet Thomas Moore (1779–1852) during a visit to Canada in 1804.  "The Canadian Boat Song" was so popular that it was published several times over the next forty years in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Dancing likewise was extremely  popular form of entertainment as noted In 1807 by the Scottish traveler and artist George Heriot (1759–1839), who wrote..   Among the earliest musical societies were Halifaxs "New Union Singing Society" of 1809 and Quebec's "Harmonic Society" of  1820. One of the first registered all-civilian  musical ensemble was a religious sect organized from Upper Canada called the Children of Peace in 1820. 1833, a student orchestra was organized at the Séminaire de Québec the Société Ste-Cécile, as it was known, is one of the earliest ensemble of its kind in Lower Canada. The first appearance of a piece of music in a newspaper or magazine was in the pages of the Montreal twice-weekly newspaper, La Minerve, on September 19, 1831.  Many immigrants during this time lived in relative isolation and music sometimes obtained through subscriptions to newspapers and magazines, provided entertainment and a life line to civilization. One of the  earliest  surviving publication in Canada of a song for the piano in sheet music format is The Merry Bells of England by J.F. Lehmann, in 1840. The  Great Migration of Canada from 1815 to 1850, done largely by Irish, British and Scottish immigrants, broadened considerably the Canadian musical culture.  1844, Samuel Nordheimer (1824–1912) opened a music store in Toronto selling pianos and soon thereafter began to publish engraved sheet music. Samuel Nordheimer store was among the first and the largest specialized music publisher in the Province of Canada.LAC.

By the time of Canadian Confederation (1867), songwriting had become a favored means of personal expression across the land. In a society in which most middle-class families now owned a piano, and standard education included at least the rudiments of music, the result was often an original song.The Piano Concert In Canada, 1900–1980 a bibliographic survey. by Zuk, Ireneus.

ISSN 0008-4565 The 1870s saw several conservatories opened their doors, providing their string, woodwind and brass faculty, leading to the opportunity for any  class level of society  to learn music.  'One Sweetly Solemn Thought in 1876 by Hamilton-based  Robert S. Ambrose, became one of the most popular songs to ever be published in the 19th century. It fulfilled the purpose of being an appropriate song to sing in the parlors of homes that would not permit any non-sacred music to be performed on Sundays. At the same time it could be sung in dance halls  or on the stage along operas and operettas.  "O Canada" was originally commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Honourable Théodore Robitaille (1834–1897), for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony.  Calixa Lavallée (1842–1891) wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier (1839–1920).  The text was originally only in French, before it was translated to English in 1906. Leo, the Royal Cadet a light opera with music by Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann and a libretto by George Frederick Cameron was composed in Kingston, Ontario in 1889. The work centres on Nellie's love for Leo, a cadet at the Royal Military College of Canada who becomes a hero serving during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. The operetta focussed on typical character types, events and concerns of Telgmann and Cameron's time and place.  Prior to the development of the gramophone, Canadian songwriters' works were published as sheet music, or in periodicals in local newspapers such as The Montreal Gazette and Toronto Empire. Most recordings purchased by Canadians in the early days of the gramophone were made by American and British performers, behind some of these international hits were Canadian songwriters.Music in Canada, capturing landscape and diversity by Elaine Keillor. Montreal McGill-Queen's University Press. 1939 (ISBN 0-7735-3177-7) Robert Nathaniel Dett (1882–1943) was among the first Black Canadian composers during the early years of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. His works often appeared among the programs of William Marion Cook's New York syncopated Orchestra. Dett himself performed at Carnegie Hall and at the Boston Symphony Hall as a pianist and choir director.Southern, Eileen. The Music of Black Americans: A History. W. W. Norton & Company; 3rd edition. (ISBN 0-393-97141-4)  Following quickly on the gramophone's spread came Canada's involvement in the First World War. The war was the catalyst for the writing and recording of large numbers of Canadian-written popular songs, some of which achieved lasting international commercial success. The military during WWI produced  official music such as regimental marches and songs as well as utilitarian bugle calls. The soldiers had a repertoire of their own, largely consisting of new, often ribald, lyrics to older tunes.  Canada's first  independent record label Compo Company built a pressing plant (the largest of its day) in 1918 at Lachine, Quebec. Compo was originally created to serve the several American independent record companies such as Okeh Records which wanted to distribute records in Canada. The 1920s saw Canada's first radio stations, this  allowed  Canadian songwriters to  contribute some of the most famous popular music of the early 20th century. Canada's first commercial radio station CFCF (formerly XWA) begins broadcasting regularly scheduled programming in Montreal in 1920, followed by CKAC, Canada's first French language radio station, in 1922. By 1923, there were 34 radio stations in Canada and  subsequently proliferated at a remarkable rate, and with them spread the popularity of jazz. Jazz became associated with all things modern, sophisticated, and also decadent.Hakim, Joy (1995). War, Peace, and All That Jazz. New York, New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 41–46. (ISBN 0-19-509514-6) In 1925, the Canadian Performing Rights Society was formed to administer public performance and  royalties for composers and lyricists. It became known as the Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada (CAPAC). Toronto-born Murray Adaskin (1906–2002) was a violinist, composer, conductor and teacher at the University of Saskatchewan. From  1923 to 1936 he was  an orchestral and chamber musician with the  Toronto Symphony Orchestra, he was later named head of music at the University of Saskatchewan. He was a composer-in-residence at the University of Saskatchewan, the first appointment of this type in Canada.Everett-Green, Robert.

Canada's first big band  star  was  Guy Lombardo (1902–1977), who formed his easy listening band, The Royal Canadians, with his brothers and friends. They achieved international success starting in the mid-1920s  selling an estimated 250 million phonograph records, and were the first Canadians to have a #1 single on Billboards top 100.  1932, the first Broadcasting Act was passed by Parliament creating the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission. It was to both to regulate all broadcasting and create a new national public radio network. 1936, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation came into existence, at the time, a million Canadian households had a radio. Emerging out of the great depression  on near equal-footing to American popular music, Canadian popular  music continued to enjoy considerable success at home and abroad in the preceding years.Before the gold rush: flashbacks to the dawn of the Canadian sound by Nicholas Jennings, (Yorkville ON: Viking, 1997) (ISBN 0-670-87381-0)Canadian music fast facts : profiles of Canada's pop music pioneers. by Randy Ray and Mark Kearney London, Ont. : Sparky Jefferson Productions, c1991.

Canada during the Second World War  produced some patriotic songs, but they were not hits in the music industry sense. A number of Canadian singers who learned their craft in Canadian opera companies in the 1930s went on to sing in major international opera houses.SOCAN yearbook. Don Mills, Ont. : Society of Composers, Authors and Music publishers of Canada, 1994- (ML27 .C3S635) Most notable from the 1940s is  contralto singer Portia White (1911–1968). She achieved international fame because of her voice and stage presence.  As a Canadian female of African descent, her popularity helped to open previously-closed doors for talented  women who followed. She has   been declared "A person of national historic significance" by the Government of Canada. In 1964 she  performed for Queen Elizabeth II, at the opening of the Confederation Centre of the Arts.  Following  World War II a growth phase for Canadian bands was experienced, this time among school bands. Rapid advances in the inclusion of instrumental music study in formal school curricula brought about fundamental changes to the philosophy of the band movement and the type of repertoire available.  The CHUM Chart  debuted on May 27, 1957, under the name CHUM's Weekly Hit Parade, was in response to the fast-growing diversity of music that needed to be subdivided and categorized.Music Directory of Canada. 8th ed.

Canadian artists and Canadian ensembles were generally forced to turn toward the United States to establish healthy long lasting careers during the 1960s.  Canada would  produce some of the world's most influential singer-songwriters during this time. Among the most notable is Winnipeg's Neil Young who has been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, Canada's Walk of Fame and  the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice.  Leonard Cohen has been inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame and is also a Companion of the Order of Canada. Folk legend Joni Mitchell is an Alberta native, and has been inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Walt Grealis of Toronto started in the music business with Apex Records in 1960, the Ontario distributor for Compo Company. He later joined London Records, where he worked until February 1964, when he then established RPM weekly trade magazine. From the first issue of RPM Weekly on February 24, 1964 to its final issue on November 13, 2000, RPM was the defining charts in Canada. The American and British counterculture explosion and hippie movement had diverted music to  that  which was  dominated by socially and American politically incisive lyrics by the late 1960s.San Francisco Chronicle, 18 January 1967 column, p. 27 The music was an attempt to reflect upon the events of the time – civil rights, the war in Vietnam and the rise of feminism.Axes, Chops & Hot Licks: the Canadian rock music scene by Ritchie York, (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1971, 1979) (ISBN 0-88830-052-2) This led to the Canadian government passing Canadian content legislation to help Canadian artists. On January 18, 1971 regulations came into force requiring AM radio stations to devote 30 per cent of their musical selections to Canadian content. Although this was (and still is) controversial, it quite clearly contributed to the development of a nascent Canadian pop star system.  With the introduction in the mid-1970s  of mainstream music on FM radio stations, where it was common practice to program extended performances, musicians were no longer limited to songs of three minutes' duration as dictated by AM stations for decades. The most notable musicians to benefit from this and one of the largest Canadian exports is the progressive rock band, Rush. Rush have  produced  25 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records, making them one of the best-selling ensembles  in history, and on April 18, 2013, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In the classical world, homegrown talent Canadian Brass was established in Toronto 1970—they are credited with reshaping concert presentation style for classical artists, now copied and valued everywhere in the classical world. Canada's first nationwide music awards  began as a reader poll conducted by Canadian music industry trade magazine RPM Weekly in December 1964. A similar balloting process continued until 1970 when the RPM Gold Leaf Awards, as they were then known, were changed to the Juno Awards. The  Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences held the first Juno Award ceremony in 1975. This was in  response to rectifying the same  concerns  about promotion  of Canadian artists that the   Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission had. Canadian music changed course in the 1980s and 1990s, the changing fast-paced culture was accompanied by an explosion in youth culture.Heart of Gold: 30 years of Canadian pop music by Martin Melhuish, (Toronto: CBC Enterprises, 1983) (ISBN 978-0-88794-112-2 Until the mid-1960s, little attention was paid to music by Canadian daily newspapers except as news or novelty. With the introduction during the late 1970s of the "Music critic", coverage began to rival that of any other topic. Canadian publications devoted to all styles of music either exclusively or in tandem with more general editorial content directed to young readers, was expanding exponentially.The Arts in the 1970s: Cultural Closure?B.

The 1971 CRTC rules (30% Canadian content on Canadian radio) finally come into full effect and by the end of the 20th century radio stations would have to play 35% Canadian content.  This  led to an explosion in the 21st century of Canadian  pop musicians  dominating  the airwaves unlike any era before.  In 1996, VideoFACT  launched PromoFACT, a funding program to help new artists produce electronic press kits and websites. At about the same time, the CD (cheap to manufacture) replaced the vinyl album and Compact Cassette (expensive to manufacture). Shortly thereafter, the Internet allowed musicians to directly distribute their music, thus bypassing the selection of the old-fashioned "record label". Canada's main stream music industry has suffered as a result of the internet and the boom of independent music. The drop in annual sales between 1999 - the year that Napster's unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing service launched - and the end of 2004 was $465 million.  In 2007, Canada joined the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement talks, whose outcome will have a significant impact on the Canadian music industry. In 2010 Canada introduced new copyright legislation. The amended law  makes hacking  digital locks illegal, but enshrine into law the ability of purchasers to record  and copy music from a CD to portable devices. The early 2000s saw Canadian independent artists continue to expand their audience into the United States and beyond. Mainstream Canadian artists with global recorded contracts such as Michael Bublé, Drake and Justin Bieber reached new heights in terms of international success, while  dominating the American music charts.   Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British patriotism, preceding the first legal steps to independence by over 50 years. The earliest, "The Bold Canadian", was written in 1812.  The Canadian Music Hall of Fame established in 1976 honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements. The ceremony is held each year as part of Canada's main annual music industry awards the Juno's . The Governor General's Performing Arts Awards for Lifetime Artistic Achievement are the foremost honours presented for excellence in the performing arts, in the categories of dance, classical music, popular music, film, and radio and television broadcasting. They were initiated in 1992 by then Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn, and winners receive $25,000 and a medal struck by the Royal Canadian Mint. Canada also has many specific music awards, both for different genres and for geographic regions:   Distinctive music scenes have been an integral part of the cultural landscape of Canada. With Canada being vast in size, the country throughout its history has had regional music scenes, with a wide and divers accumulation of styles and genres from many different individual communities, such as Inuit music, music of the Maritimes and Canadian fiddle music.Encyclopedia of Canadian rock, pop and folk music by Rick Jackson, (Kingston, ON: Quarry Press, Inro (1994) (ISBN 1-55082-107-5)   "O Canada" - the national anthem adopted in 1980.
