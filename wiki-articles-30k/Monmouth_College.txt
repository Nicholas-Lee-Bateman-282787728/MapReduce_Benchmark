    Monmouth College is a four-year coeducational private liberal arts college located in Monmouth, Illinois, United States. Monmouth is a selective, exclusively undergraduate four-year institution that enrolls approximately 1,300 students from 35 countries. Students choose courses from 35 major programs, 30 minors and 16 pre-professional programs in a core curriculum that features strong majors and an integrative learning course sequence. Monmouth College was founded on April 18, 1853, by the Second Presbytery of Illinois, a frontier arm of the Associate Reformed (Presbyterian) Church. The college celebrates this date as "Scholars Day", cancelling classes for a day of celebration and an honors convocation. Founded as "Monmouth Academy," the school became Monmouth College after receiving a charter from the state legislature on September 3, 1856. The college remains affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and is a member of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, a consortium of small, private liberal arts colleges. The college's motto "Lux" ("Light") appears on its seal. The first president, David Wallace built two mission churches in Massachusetts before assuming the Monmouth presidency. Founded on the eve of the American Civil War, the college immediately faced a serious crisis. The college's campus was still under construction while virtually the entire male student body left for military service. Two hundred and thirty-two students, faculty members, and trustees served in the Civil War. A quarter of them were wounded and one in eight was killed. Two were awarded the Medal of Honor, and Abner C. Harding, a college trustee who raised a regiment composed largely of MC students, was commissioned a brigadier general for his leadership in the defense of Fort Donelson in 1863. President Wallace, believing that the college "must educate, whether there be peace or war," kept classes in session for what was then a primarily female student body. Monmouth was founded as a coeducational college where women and men had equal access to courses. When veterans returning to the college decided to form fraternities, a group of women was determined not to be outdone, and in 1867 established the first fraternity for women, known today as Pi Beta Phi. Three years later, another well-known women’s fraternity, Kappa Kappa Gamma, was founded at Monmouth. Monmouth College had gained national stature by 1911 as shown by its US government classification where 59 colleges and universities ranked higher and 244 ranked lower (out of a total of 345 top colleges). World War II posed a crisis to the institution similar to that of the Civil War, as male students began enlisting in the service within a month of Pearl Harbor, and soon only a handful remained on campus. Through an arrangement with the Navy Department, the college survived by becoming a U.S. Naval Flight Preparatory School, and later offered a V-5 Navy Academic Refresher Unit program for officers. Courses were taught by Monmouth’s liberal arts faculty. The Navy later adopted portions of Monmouth's curriculum for training programs nationwide. More than 2,000 Navy men went through Monmouth College, a number of whom would re-enroll at the college after the war funded by the G.I. Bill. Monmouth’s chemistry department gained national prominence in the 1950s when longtime professor William S. Haldeman was recognized with a major award by the American Chemical Society. The Steelman Report on Manpower for Research noted that Monmouth and four other small colleges—Hope, Juniata, St. Olaf and Oberlin—together had "produced more candidates for the doctor's degree in chemistry than Johns Hopkins, Fordham, Columbia, Tulane and Syracuse Universities combined." Beginning in the 1960s, a secularization movement changed the nature of the college. Concurrent with dwindling financial support from the United Presbyterian Church, the college removed the Church Synod’s role in nominating and confirming trustees, thus opening the door for the cultivation of new trustees with stronger business acumen and financial resources than those during the college’s earlier days. The college did otherwise maintain its covenant relationship with the Church. During the Vietnam War, the military draft (and the ability to avoid the draft by enrolling in college) contributed to increases in college attendance throughout the US. Attendance at the college increased but then fell when the draft ended in the 1970s causing financial strain not unlike the losing of students to the Civil War had done in the then distant past. In 1983, a donation from an alumnus committed $5 million to the endowment and launched a $15 million capital campaign, the largest gift in college history to that point.Meyer, Daniel. (2002) A Thousand Hearts’ Devotion: A History of Monmouth College, Monmouth College. pp. 122-147. ISBN 0-9720303-0-1 During the 1990s, enrollment began a steady increase that would see it more than double over the next two decades, from less than 600 in 1993 to 1,379 in 2009. The endowment also grew substantially, from $23.6 million in 1993 to $87.2 million in 2013. Between 2002 and 2013, more than $120 million was invested in new construction and renovations to the campus. Monmouth is a founding member of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest and a member of the Annapolis Group of independent liberal arts colleges. Monmouth also continues its relationship with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), although courses in religion are no longer required, and is an active member of the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities, of which President Mauri Ditzler served as chair in 2011-2012. Chemistry at Monmouth is an approved baccalaureate program by the American Chemical Society. Monmouth College offers 35 major fields of study and 16 pre-professional fields of study (with 851 different courses offered)  in the sciences, arts, humanities, mathematics, computer sciences, social sciences, foreign languages, classics, and several interdisciplinary fields (including premedical and pre-engineering studies) and provides an unusually integrated core curriculum. This curriculum includes four signature courses designed to aid students in making connections across disciplines and understanding their education as an integrated whole. The curriculum allows freshman students to take advanced classes, and senior students to take introductory courses. For freshmen, the only course requirement mandated by the course registrar is one of the first-year seminar courses called Introduction to Liberal Arts which are usually limited to 16 students (and never more than 18) and shares a common focus on critical analysis and development of written and oral argument.  Besides a first-year seminar course, the other 31 courses (usually four are taken per semester) required for graduation can be elected by the students themselves. Nevertheless, to complete their major, students must still adhere to departmental course requirements. Upon entering the college, new students are assigned a faculty advisor. These advisors guide students through the educational process. Each faculty advisor works with a limited number of students to ensure a course of study that has both breadth and depth and is integrated across disciplines while still being intellectually fulfilling. Faculty advising continues for the remainder of each student’s education. 16 percent of Monmouth students in the class of 2013 were double majors. A small number of triple majors and interdisciplinary majors also exist. Within five years of graduation, over sixty percent of Monmouth alumni attend graduate school or another form of ongoing education. A survey taken six months after the class of 2012 had graduated, showed that 99% of Monmouth graduates were employed (or were in graduate school); the 2013 and 2014 surveys also showed 99%. Other concepts integral to the Monmouth College curriculum is the concept of total immersion and the power of the entire college experience to provide transformative development for the student. Accordingly, the college provides extensive out-of-the-classroom opportunities for students to develop and to interact with as many other disciplines as possible. This is reflected in the approximately 120 student organizations and close faculty/student interaction that is a part of the college experience at Monmouth. Maintaining a student-to-faculty ratio of 11:1 and an average class size of 13 students, Monmouth places a high priority on meaningful interaction between students and their professors. 85 percent of faculty hold the highest degrees in their fields. With the favorable student-to-faculty ratio, Monmouth classrooms are characterized by face-to-face interaction between professor and student that is, by design, frequent and with great depth. Outside the classroom professors often serve as academic advisers, student organization advisers and mentors. Professors draw students (even first-year students during the summer prior to their enrollment) into independent research or creative work, which results in original scholarly product. Under the mentorship of faculty, many science students participate in sophisticated graduate-level research using state-of-the-art equipment and facilities, and are listed as co-authors on faculty articles that appear in peer-reviewed journals. Students from all disciplines also have the opportunity to submit articles for publication in Monmouth College's Midwest Journal of Undergraduate Research. The Carnegie Foundation classifies Monmouth as a selective institution. For the Class of 2017 (enrolled autumn 2013), Monmouth received 2972 applications and accepted 1914 (64.4%). In 2014, 54% of students were female and 46% were male. Students come from 30 states and 35 countries. 25% were students of color and 7% were international students. The transfer admissions process was more selective, with 126 admitted (51.2%) out of 246 applicants for the 2013 autumn semester. The college uses rolling admissions meaning that once the prospective student’s application for admission is complete, a decision is usually made by the college within two weeks. Monmouth is a founding member of the fourteen-member Associated Colleges of the Midwest (ACM) consortium. The colleges share resources and develop and operate common off-campus academic programs. The members of the ACM include some of the finest colleges and universities in the middle west region of the United States and include top-ranked Carleton College and Grinnell College among others.  Among the resources on the 112-acre (0.45 square kilometer) campus at Monmouth College are dozens of academic and residential buildings, athletic fields and facilities, three wildlife sanctuaries for the study of ecology, and trails and other areas for hiking. Notable resources include the Shields Collection of antiquities, the largest privately held collection of Native American artifacts in the region, the only direct copy of the Canopus Stone outside of the Cairo Museum, an astronomical observatory, the Mellinger writing center, the Wackerle Career and Leadership center, and some of the finest sporting facilities in any Division III school. The Kasch Performance Hall provides an elegant and traditional setting for musical performances with excellent acoustics and includes a recently refurbished three-manual pipe organ. The Wells Theater is located on campus and has been recently upgraded with new high tech lighting and sound equipment. The "black box" experimental Fusion Theatre is located in downtown Monmouth and opened in 2013. Internet connection is available in all student residences and the entire campus also has unlimited access to wireless internet. There are ten residence halls, an intercultural house, seven Greek houses, and four apartment buildings available for student use. The campus has undergone major expansion in recent years. Bowers Hall, a premium residence hall built in 2001, was the first new dormitory in over 30 years. The college purchased and upgraded an apartment complex near the campus in 2003 and Pattee Hall, built on the north side on the campus, was completed before the Fall of 2005. Gracie Peterson Hall, a modern coed residence hall opened in the fall of 2007. The Peacock Athletic Complex was built in 2000, supplemented by a new tennis complex in 2003. It reopened the completely renovated Dahl Chapel and Auditorium containing a 600-seat English Chapel style recital hall/auditorium as well as music rehearsal space in 2003. In 2008, the April Zorn Memorial Stadium was completed, enlarging the seating capacity for football and track events to 2,600 and adding a state-of-the-art press box. The largest building on campus is the 154,000-square-foot (14,400 m2) Huff Athletic Center. It encompasses the college's existing Glennie Gymnasium and includes a field house with indoor tennis courts and track, natatorium, fitness complex, wellness suite, locker and training rooms, classrooms and offices. Opened in 2013 is the $40 million, 138,000-square-foot (12,800 m2) Center for Science and Business, which houses the departments of accounting, biology, chemistry, economics, mathematics & computer science, physics, psychology and political economy & commerce. The new facility introduces a cadaver lab, the Adolphson Observatory with research-grade 20-inch reflecting telescope, nuclear physics lab, two parallel computing facilities, a moot boardroom, tax preparation facilities, one-way observation labs, and an FDA approved nutrition lab. The college maintains a state-of-the-art digital television studio and media (computer) lab, a web-based radio station, digital classrooms, and three art galleries. The college also maintains the LeSuer Nature Preserve, a 16.5-acre (67,000 m2) nature preserve, the Hamilton Research Pond, a prairie grass laboratory and a riparian property on the banks of the Mississippi river for the purposes of wetland biological research. The Ivory Quinby House,Reigel, page 414William, Urban.Ivory Quinby, The Burlington Railroad, and Monmouth College built by a founder of Monmouth College, is now the home of the President of the college and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Students regularly attend functions at the home, including dinners and discussion groups. Monmouth College has reduced its energy consumption and has substantially increased its recycling contributions in recent years. These efforts include energy reduction through the installation of numerous new heating boilers throughout campus, the use of energy efficient lighting, low-flow water systems and the replacement of windows in nearly all older buildings. The new Center for Science and Business includes energy efficient heating/cooling systems and heat recapture exhaust systems among many other features. Recycling efforts now extend into every student residence and office building. Some students have also committed themselves to sustainability of food production by opting to live in the college’s Garden theme housing which grows its own organic food and harvests its own honey using college facilities including seven acres set aside for such use. The college also provides scholarships for students who have demonstrated leadership in sustainability prior to enrolling. The college provides free access to bicycles for student use, and an electric vehicle recharging station is located on campus. Over seventy off-campus programs are available in over fifty countries and may run for as little as ten days or as long as a year but generally last one semester. Programs offered through the Associated Colleges of the Midwest consortium take place usually for one semester at over a dozen locales around the globe and include cultural, scientific, economic, historical and other forms of study and research. The diversity of these programs spans such topics as scientific research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to government interning in Washington, D.C. to cultural activities in Florence, Italy. Monmouth College faculty frequently teach in these programs along with other members of the consortium including Carleton College, Grinnell College, and eleven other colleges. Other programs run exclusively by Monmouth College include a wide-ranging program in Scotland. In 2012, four Monmouth College students studied at the Fulbright International Summer Institute in Bulgaria, accompanied by a Monmouth College Associate Dean who taught at the Institute.  With over a half million items catalogued, the Hewes Library provides students access to its broad collections. Besides books and periodicals and a large interlibrary loan capability, the library also houses collections of antiquities, rare books, art, archaeology, and also computer laboratories and high tech support. A major remodeling in 2000 has resulted in a modern open-stack facility. Hundreds of internships are arranged annually for students through the Wackerle Career and Leadership Center. These include public service work around the country. Students have also interned, beginning as early as the first year, opting from opportunities at such businesses as Caterpillar Inc., Deere & Co., Monsanto, law offices, medical offices, and many others. Summer internships are also available at the college in such offices as Admission, Financial Aid, Student Life, Hewes Library, Marketing communication, fundraising and others. Summer research opportunities exist for students and also incoming freshmen and transfers in the sciences and many other areas of study. This research is conducted with professors and students working in groups and includes such varied topics such as lightning research, archaeology and music. Included are allowances for a stipend and room and board expenses. Monmouth’s comprehensive tuition, room, and board fees for the 2015-16 academic year is $42,450. Once miscellaneous personal expenses are factored in the total cost to attend for the 2015-16 academic year is approximately $45,400. Despite its cost of attendance shown above, Monmouth College provides scholarships or financial aid to over 98% of students. The average financial aid package award for 2014-15 was $30,090 (of which $4,325 were loans and work study); the average net price of attendance was $10,760. This average is for all freshmen students including those with no financial need. Merit scholarships are automatically offered upon the completion of application to the college. Competitive scholarships in the areas of fine arts, sustainability, Presbyterian, and Latin are determined by an application process in January or February annually. Need based financial aid is determined by the student filing the FAFSA federal form. These students are encouraged to file this form in January although later filing is accepted. The college maintains a staff of experts who aid students and parents in working through these processes in order to build the best possible financial package. Outside scholarships are accepted with no reduction in Monmouth College aid or scholarships. Students represent about 30 states and about 35 countries. Ninety-three percent of students live on campus in dormitories, theme houses, Greek housing, or apartment buildings. There are over 120 student groups that pursue various interests through student-lead organizations funded by the student government or the college, including cultural, religious, publications, professional, honors, fine and performing arts, political advocacy, service groups, housing, and athletic organizations.
