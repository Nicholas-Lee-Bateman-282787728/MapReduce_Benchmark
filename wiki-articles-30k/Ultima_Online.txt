 Ultima Online (UO) is a graphical, massively multiplayer, online role-playing game (MMORPG), released on 24 September 1997, by Origin Systems. It was the first game of the genre to reach widespread popularity and influenced all later games of this type. Ultima Online is a fantasy role-playing game set in the Ultima universe. It is known for its extensive player versus player combat system. Since its release, it has added eight expansion packs, a booster pack and dozens of free content updates. The release of Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn in 2007 brought a new game engine with an upgraded visual experience. Ultima Online is the product of Richard Garriott's idea for a fantasy game involving several thousand people who can all play in a shared fantasy world. Prior games allowed hundreds of people to play at the same time, including Habitat (beta-tested in 1986), The Realm Online, Neverwinter Nights (the AOL version) and Meridian 59; however, Ultima Online significantly outdid these games, both graphically and in game mechanics. The initial team was composed of Garriott, Starr Long, Rick Delashmit, Scott Phillips and, a bit later Raph Koster, who became the lead designer. Koster wrote public "designer letters" and usually went by his nickname of Designer Dragon. Koster drew inspiration from prior online games, such as DartMUD.Koster MUD-Dev Posting "DartMUD was influential on me, certainly—ought to have been for everyone." The project started in 1995 and was presented to the public at E3 as "Ultima Online: Shattered Legacy" in May 1996. The development cost was much greater than traditional computer games; it relied on people accessing servers via modem. Ultima Online's initial features included persistent player housing, skill-based character progression (without levels or classes),<ref> {{cite book | last = Alexander | first = Thor | title = Massively Multiplayer Game Development | publisher = Charles River Media | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781584502432 | page = 24}}</ref> a craft-based and player-driven economy,<ref>{{cite book | last = Alexander | first = Thor | title = Massively Multiplayer Game Development | publisher = Charles River Media | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781584502432 | page = 22}}</ref> and unrestricted player-versus-player combat.<ref>{{cite book | last = Alexander | first = Thor | title = Massively Multiplayer Game Development | publisher = Charles River Media | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781584502432 | page = 91}}</ref>  ====The Assassination of Lord British==== [[Lord British]] was Garriot's in-game [[alter ego]], who was famously killed during an in-game appearance at Ultima Online's beta test on August 9, 1997. During a server population stress test, a player character known as Rainz cast the "fire field" spell, killing Lord British. Producer Starr Long blamed it on human error: Lord British's character, like others, had been made invulnerable to this kind of attack, but by design the invulnerability did not persist over several game sessions. When the server crashed shortly before the incident, Garriott forgot to reset his invulnerability status. Shortly after, administrators banned Rainz's account from the beta test for repeatedly exploiting, rather than reporting, bugs. According to Origin, he was not banned for the assassination but rather for prior complaints against his account highlighted by this incident. Beta testers protested Rainz's ban as well as subsequent actions of Long and other developers, during which his in-game character used a spell to indiscriminately kill other characters who observed the assassination.  MMOCrunch calls it the most memorable event in MMORPG History.<ref name=5BM>{{Cite journal|title=Five Biggest Moments in UO History|publisher=Computer Gaming World|date=2 November 2002|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_220.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2002/06/52894|title=Make Love, Not War Games|author=Brad King|date=8 June 2002|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)]]}}</ref>  September 1997 was the last day of the original [[beta test]]. The beta ended with a bang, as players were treated to an "end of the world" scenario with Shadowlords, demons, and other evil creatures slaughtering every character in sight.  ===Origin Era (1995-2004)=== In September 1997, ''Ultima Online'' launched and opened the first game servers to the public.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/04/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/|title=Electronic Arts' online folly|author=Chris Morris|date=4 March 2003|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Upon release, ''Ultima Online'' proved popular, reaching 100,000 paying subscribers within six months, causing severe [[lag]] problems.  In 1999, servers opened around the world to support the rising popularity of the game, in [[Japan]], [[Europe]] and [[South Korea]].  In 2000, Garriot resigned from Origin, taking Lord British with him. Game players created their own [[fanfiction]] speculations as to why the Lord had vanished.  In February 2000, a large in-world event had a massive army of undead lay siege to the Britannia city of Trinsic. The event ran concurrently on all servers over several months. Another server opened in [[Australia]] during this time.  In May 2000, ''Ultima Online's'' second expansion ''[[Ultima Online: Renaissance]]'' dramatically altered the game. It split the game world into two parts called Trammel and [[Felucca]], one was a consensual PVP zone, while the other was non-consensual.  In November 2000, a  ''Ultima Online's'' first official fanfest was held, called the UO World Faire in [[Austin, TX]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-68511984/uo-fans-get-medieval.html|title=UO Fans Get Medieval – Wine, women, and song at the Ultima Online World Faire.|publisher=Computer Gaming World|date=1 February 2001}}</ref>  In March 2001, ''Ultima Online's'' third expansion ''|[[Ultima Online: Third Dawn]]'' was released. It added a new area to the server called Ilshenar. This new area could only be accessed with a new game client that launched with the expansion. The original game client could be used in the previous server areas.  In January 2002, ''Ultima Online''<nowiki/>'s second official fanfest was called Online Worlds FanFest, also held in Austin. Players were able to meet the developers, as well as guest speaker [[Todd McFarlane]]. February saw the release of ''Ultima Online's'' fourth expansion ''[[Ultima Online: Lord Blackthorn's Revenge]]''. Notably, it enabled access to the areas previously only available to the newer ''Third Dawn'' game client.  In February 2003, ''Ultima Online's'' fifth expansion ''[[Ultima Online: Age of Shadows]]'' was released. It was the most game changing update yet including: offering players the ability to custom design their game homes, a server area that doubled the size of homes, and overhauled the item system. Around March 2003 ''Ultima Online'' reached approximately 250,000 subscribers.  In February 2004, [[Origin Systems]] shut down. ''Ultima Online'' no longer had a named studio managing it. Development headquarters moved from Austin to [[Fairfax, Virginia]].  ===Electronic Arts Era (2004-2006)=== The sixth expansion, ''[[Ultima Online: Samurai Empire|Samurai Empire]]'', launched in November 2004 was Japanese-themed. It offered two new professions, the [[Ninja]] and the [[Samurai]], as well as new Japanese-themed housing tile sets. New lands, the [[Tokuno Islands]], were added, with the cities being styled after ancient Japanese cities.  ''Ultima Online'' was the first MMORPG to reach the 100,000 subscriber base, far exceeding that of any game that went before it.<ref>{{cite web |title=EA Announces Ultima Online(TM): Kingdom Reborn (Working Title); The Game That Firmly Established the MMORPG Genre Receives a Massive Visual Overhaul and New Content in 2007 |url=http://investor.ea.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=314331 |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |accessdate=3 May 2011 |date=24 August 2006}}</ref>  Subscriber numbers peaked at around 250,000 in July 2003, but then began a steady decline.

Expansion number seven, ''[[Ultima Online: Mondain's Legacy|Mondain's Legacy]]'', launched in August 2005. It featured the second player race, [[Elves]]. The quest system received a major upgrade, as did the crafting system. Spellweaving was added to the skills. Many new [[dungeon]]s were added. This expansion was the first that was only available online (offline versions on CDs could be ordered). Mondain's Legacy was the last expansion, with updates becoming more irregular after that point.  ===Mythic Entertainment Era (2006-2014)=== In June 2006 Electronic Arts purchased [[Mythic Entertainment]], the creators of [[Dark Age of Camelot]]. Mythic was tasked with managing EA's MMORPG portfolio, including Ultima Online.  That month it was also announced that the anti-cheating software [[PunkBuster]] would be integrated into ''Ultima Online''. This marked the first time PunkBuster would be used with an [[MMORPG]] to help curb [[cheating]]/[[exploiting]]. However, it was never integrated into the game, and in November 2006, Electronic Arts put the [[PunkBuster]] integration on indefinite hold.  In August 2007 ''[[Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn]]'' was released. This was the first major overhaul of the client and artwork systems since ''[[Ultima Online: Third Dawn]]''.  The final expansion was [[Ultima Online: Stygian Abyss|Stygian Abyss]] (2009), which focused on the gargoyle race.  After Stygian Abyss the development model shifted from expansions to "booster packs" that were intended to be smaller updates released more frequently. However, the "first" booster pack [[Ultima Online: High Seas|High Seas]] of 2010 was also the last.  ===Broadsword Era (2014-)=== It was announced on 6 February 2014 that development of the game would be transferred from Mythic to a newly made studio ([[Broadsword]]) that would take over future development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uo.com/article/Producer-Letter-0|title=Producer Letter|publisher=}}</ref>  ==Game Mechanics== ''Ultima Online'' continued the tradition of previous ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' games in many ways, but due to advancing technology and the simple fact that it was Origin's first [[persistent world|persistent]] online game, many new game mechanics appeared. Partially designed as a social and economic experiment, the game had to account for widespread player interaction as well as deal with the traditionof players feeling as if they were the center of attention, as had been the case in single-player games.  ===Artificial Life Engine=== Starr Long, the game's associate producer, explained in 1996: {{quote|Nearly everything in the world, from grass to goblins, has a purpose, and not just as cannon fodder either. The 'virtual ecology' affects nearly every aspect of the game world, from the very small to the very large. If the rabbit population suddenly drops (because some gung-ho adventurer was trying out his new mace) then wolves may have to find different food sources (e.g., deer). When the deer population drops as a result, the local dragon, unable to find the food he’s accustomed to, may head into a local village and attack. Since all of this happens automatically, it generates numerous adventure possibilities.}}  However, this feature never made it beyond the game's beta stage. As Richard Garriott explained: {{quote|We thought it was fantastic. We'd spent an enormous amount of time and effort on it. But what happened was all the players went in and just killed everything; so fast that the game couldn't spawn them fast enough to make the simulation even ''begin''. And so, this thing that we'd spent all this time on, literally no-one ever noticed – ''ever'' – and we eventually just ripped it out of the game, you know, with some sadness.<ref>{{cite web|last=Garriott|first=Richard|title=Good Game interview|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/webexclusives/|work=in conversation with Bajo of Good Game|publisher=ABC Television, Australia|accessdate=3 March 2011}}</ref>}}  ===Worlds=== The game began with a single world, with specific expansion packs adding additional territory and new worlds.  The second world was the "Lost Lands", with additional land, dungeons, creatures, and terrain. The third was Trammel. This led the developers to distinguish the original world by making the environment more grim, and naming it "Felucca".<ref name="CNETuor">{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/pc-games/ultima-online-renaissance-pc/1707-9696_7-30976459.html |title=Ultima Online: Renaissance (PC) – PC Games – CNET Archive |publisher=Reviews.cnet.com |accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref>  The two kinds of servers were "normal" servers with both Trammel (consensual PVP) and Felucca (non-consensual PVP) ruleset and "siege" servers with non-consensual PVP and no item insurance.

The consequences of in-game criminality were adjusted over time, but maintaining the general commitment to player freedom. As explained by designer Raph Koster, "Being safe from evil is, in my mind, an uneven tradeoff for the fact that you don't get to be heroes anymore, in that you can just opt out of fighting evil. It may be nobody wants to be heroes except when it doesn't count, when it isn't challenging, that people would rather fight 'pretend evil' than the real thing, but I don't personally believe that. I still think people are better than that." <ref>{{cite web  |author = Raph Koster  |url = http://www.raphkoster.com/gaming/postmortem.shtml  |title = Postmortem  |publisher = Raph Koster's Website  |accessdate = 2006-08-09 }}</ref> Eventually, the Renaissance expansion created large areas of the game in which it was not possible to harm other players.

It was to add [[steampunk]] elements to the fantasy setting, set in a world where the past, present and future of Sosaria were merged by a mistake made by Lord British while attempting to merge the shards of the Gem of Immortality. Todd McFarlane was hired to design original monsters and regions for the game, as well as help shape the story. It was cancelled in 2001 before its release, citing the competitive nature of the massively multiplayer online gaming market—Electronic Arts feared the sequel would harm ''Ultima Online's'' subscription numbers. Some of the monsters and art made for the game were later used in the ''Ultima Online'' expansion ''[[Ultima Online: Lord Blackthorn's Revenge|Lord Blackthorn's Revenge]]''. * ''[[Ultima X: Odyssey]]'' was a new MMORPG to be set in a world named Alucinor, created by the Avatar after the events of ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension]]''. It was cancelled in 2004 when Electronic Arts closed Origin. The UXO team was invited to move to the Bay area to finish the game. However, only a small number of people on the UXO team accepted the transfer. In the end, UXO was cancelled because the development team dissolved.  ===Other releases=== ''Ultima Online'' has had several special releases that were not expansions, but came with boxed or in-game extras. * ''Ultima Online: Charter Edition'' (30 September 1997) was available to pre-order from Origin Systems at the launch of ''Ultima Online'' and in small quantities alongside the standard retail box. It included a signed lithograph of the ''Ultima Online'' artwork by the Hilderbrandt brothers and a pewter pin badge bearing the ''Ultima Online'' logo. The box was not signed by Richard Garriott, but simply bears a digital print of his Lord British signature. The Charter Edition included the cloth map that was also a feature of the standard box, and included three months of subscription time, as opposed to the single month included with the standard box. * ''Ultima Online: Discovery Edition'' (1 February 2000) was released to the Australian and New Zealand markets at the same time as the launch of the Oceania server for the region. * ''Ultima Online: 7th Anniversary'' (25 September 2004) was a special release of the game to celebrate ''Ultima Online's'' seventh birthday. It included a more recently patched CD. This release was contained in a small cardboard box containing a triple-CD jewel case, featuring ''Ultima Online: Age of Shadows'', but also included ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension]]'' install and play discs as a bonus. A glossy booklet showing the history of ''Ultima Online'' expansions was included that contained historic art and an interview from the ''Ultima Online'' team and community leaders. It included a code for an in-game gift, one of which was ''Ultima Online's'' famous Hilderbrant print, an extra character slot (a total of six characters was now available) and 7 buddy registration codes. * ''Ultima Online: Gold'' (18 July 2005) was sold by Wal-Mart and includes the same content as ''[[Ultima Online: Samurai Empire]]''. This edition came with an Advanced Character token code and quick-start manual. * ''Ultima Online: The Eighth Age'' (25 September 2005) was a boxed game CD with an array of in-game tokens. The release was to celebrate ''Ultima Online's'' eighth birthday. The box included an patched game CD, a glossy booklet featuring an atlas of [[Sosaria]], in-game tokens for an anniversary gift (choice of 8), a character transfer, an advanced character, a 45-day free trial code and a time-limited blue soulstone. * ''Ultima Online: 9th Anniversary Collection'' (31 October 2006). Formerly known as "Eve of a New Age." This came with an in-game upgrade code that redeemed 9 "Heritage Tokens", "Crystal" and "Shadow" items which matched new housing tile sets in the game, and attendants, which took the form of NPCs. These could be set to announce a player's presence in a house or to follow the player around on the map. The Heritage tokens could be redeemed for several kinds of items including special armor, weapons, and house decoration items in various themes (3 fruit trees, a set of rugs, tables, a broken furniture set, a "dark" or evil furniture set and more). * ''[[Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn]]'' (27 June 2007) introduced a new client with new graphics and interface. This client was never finished and was replaced by the Enhanced Client in 2009.  ==Shard emulation== Fans of ''Ultima Online'' [[reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the game to produce [[server emulator]]s of the original Electronic Arts servers.<ref name="escapist">{{cite web  |author = Joe Blancato  |url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/print/4/26  |title = The Highest Form of Flattery  |publisher = [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]  |date = 2 Aug 2005  |accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}</ref> With emulation server software it is possible to customize most aspects of the game and support large numbers of [[wikt:concurrent|concurrent]] players on a single server.  ==Clients== Electronic Arts provides the standard clients with which players are allowed to connect to the ''Ultima Online'' servers, though some third-party clients were made.  ===Original client=== The original ''Ultima Online'' client is 2D and presents a crisper, simpler artistic flavor that some people find more attractive than the 3D client. Some of the graphics used are high-resolution versions of graphics used in ''Ultima VIII: Pagan''.  ===''Ultima Online: Third Dawn'' client=== The 3D client was originally released as a part of the ''Ultima Online: Third Dawn'' expansion, but received poor reviews due to performance issues (especially [[memory leak]]s early on) and sub-par graphics. An update to the 3D client was made on 30 January 2006 when characters and creatures from the game were scaled down to smaller sizes.  As of early May/Late April 2007, the Third Dawn client was no longer supported by Electronic Arts, and focus shifted to the Kingdom Reborn client and its successor the Enhanced Client. Electronic Arts ''Ultima Online'' servers do not allow the Third Dawn client to connect.  ===''Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn'' client=== [[File:UO-Kingdom Reborn.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot from ''Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn''.]]  ''Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn'' was announced in August 2006 and was released 27 August 2007.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn for PC | publisher=Gamespot | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/ultimaonlinekingdomreborn/index.html | accessdate = 2008-09-29}}</ref> The new client modernized the game's look, making it easy to add new content without backsliding through outdated and outmoded art, while maintaining the niche market as an MMORPG that can run on [[high-end|lower-end]] computers. Electronic Arts referred to the ''Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn'' client as "2.5d," meaning that it was written in 3d and then moved into 2d to make it easier for lower-end computers to run. The client is available as a free download.  Electronic Arts originally stated that the ''Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn'' client would replace the long-standing ''Ultima Online'' client. Support for this client ended on 9 September 2009, to streamline the patch process prior to the release of the [[Ultima Online: Stygian Abyss]] expansion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zeeman|first=Chrissay|title=Kingdom Reborn Client|url=http://uo.stratics.com/uoherald/news/news.php?newsid=928|accessdate=2 May 2011|date=7 September 2009}}</ref>  ===Enhanced Client=== A modified version of the Kingdom Reborn client, renamed as the "Enhanced Client," was introduced as part of the Stygian Abyss expansion. It was released as an [[Closed beta|open beta]] in July 2009. Changes included enhanced macro abilities, a more configurable interface, changes to the mapping system, and graphical improvements.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crowner|first=Calvin|title=New Client Open Beta|url=http://uo.stratics.com/uoherald/news/news.php?newsid=863|accessdate=3 May 2011|date=17 July 2009}}</ref> The enhanced graphics of the Kingdom Reborn client had been retired in favor of lower resolution original graphics that more closely resembled the original 2D client. This graphic set was based on the Third Dawn client and was previously available in the Kingdom Reborn client as optional original graphics.  ==Awards== ''Ultima Online'''s success resulted in [[Guinness World Records]] awarding the game 8 world records in the ''Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008''. These records include "First MMORPG to Reach 100,000 Players", "Longest Running MMORPG", and "First and Only Person to Kill [[Lord British#Assassination of Lord British|Lord British]]", which was done by a player named Rainz during a server reset which turned off his invulnerability.<ref> {{cite book|title=Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008|isbn=1-904994-20-2}}</ref>  In May 2001 ''Ultima Online'' won the MPOGD game of the month award <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpogd.com/gotm/?Date=5/1/2001 |title=Multiplayer Online Games Directory / GOTM |publisher=Mpogd.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>  In 2010, ''Ultima Online'' was the first inductee into the Game Developers Choice Online Awards Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.gdconlineawards.com/nominee/index.html|title=The First Annual Game Developers Choice Online Awards}}</ref>  In 2012, [[Stratics]] presented ''Ultima Online'' with a "Historic Achievement Award" to commemorate "fifteen years of innovation, imagination, and dedication in support of the Ultima Online community."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://stratics.com/featured/stratics-presents-historic-achievement-award-to-ultima-online-team/|title=Stratics Presents Historic Achievement Award to Ultima Online Team}}</ref>  [[Time (magazine)|Time]] designated it as one of the 100 greatest video games of all time in November 2012.<ref>{{cite web |last=Peckham |first=Matt |title=All-TIME 100 Video Games |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2012-11-15 |url=http://techland.time.com/2012/11/15/all-time-100-video-games/slide/ultima-online-1997/ |accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref>  ==See also== * ''[[Ultima Worlds Online: Origin]]'' (''Ultima Online 2'') First canceled sequel. * ''[[Ultima X: Odyssey]]'' Second canceled sequel.  ==References== {{reflist|30em}}  ==External links== * {{official website|http://www.uo.com/}} * [http://www.uoguide.com/ UOGuide – ''Ultima Online'' wiki] * ''[http://www.uoforums.com/interview-area/60552-uoforums-interviews-mesanna-ultima-onlines-associate-development-manager.html UOForums Interviews Mesanna (UO's Associate Development Manager)]''. * ''[http://www.uoforums.com/interview-area/19725-uoforums-interview-tony-ray-founder-punkbuster-com.html Interview with Punkbuster's Founder, Tony Ray]''. * ''[http://www.uoforums.com/interview-area/26593-uoforums-interviews-jeremy-ultima-online-community-coordinator.html Interview with Jeremy Dalberg, Community Coordinator for Ultima Online]''. * ''[http://www.uoforums.com/interview-area/25427-uoforums-interviews-draconi.html Interview with Tim "Draconi" Cotten, Designer for Ultima Online]''. * ''[http://www.uoforums.com/interview-area/20167-uoforums-interview-cathat.html Interview with Dave "Cathat" Brown, Character and Environmental artist]''. * ''[http://www.uoforums.com/interview-area/34290-uoforums-interviews-cathat-again-27-08-2007-a.html 2nd Interview with Dave "Cathat" Brown, Character and Environmental artist]''.  {{Ultima}} {{Ultima Online}}  {{MUDs}} {{Origin Systems}}  [[Category:1997 MMORPGs]] [[Category:1997 video games]] [[Category:Active massively multiplayer online games]] [[Category:Electronic Arts games]] [[Category:Fantasy MMORPGs]] [[Category:Graphical MUDs]] [[Category:Interactive Achievement Award winners]] [[Category:Linux games]] [[Category:Role-playing video games introduced in 1997]] [[Category:Ultima (series)]] [[Category:Ultima Online| ]] [[Category:Video games featuring female antagonists]] [[Category:Video games featuring parallel universes]] [[Category:Video games with expansion packs]] [[Category:Video games with oblique graphics]] [[Category:Virtual communities]] [[Category:Virtual economies]] [[Category:Windows games]]
