 The year 2003 in film involved some significant events. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King grossed more than $1.19&nbsp;billion, making it the highest-grossing film in 2003 worldwide and in North America and (at the time) the second-highest-grossing film of all time. It is also only the second film to surpass the billion dollar milestone after Titanic in 1997. It is now, unadjusted, the twelfth-highest-grossing film of all time. Finding Nemo was the highest grossing animated movie of all time but it has since been overtaken by Toy Story 3 in 2010, the 3D rerelease of The Lion King in 2011 and Frozen and Despicable Me 2 in 2013, and Minions in 2015 leaving it currently the 6th highest grossing animated film of all time and now the 6th highest-grossing animated film after its 3D release and the 32nd highest grossing film of all time (it was once the 9th highest grossing film).
