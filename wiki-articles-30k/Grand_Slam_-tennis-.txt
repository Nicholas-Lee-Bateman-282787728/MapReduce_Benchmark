The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the Australian Open in mid January, the French Open in May and June, Wimbledon in June and July, and the US Open in August and September. Each tournament is played over a period of two weeks. The Australian and United States tournaments are played on hard courts, the French on clay, and Wimbledon on grass. Wimbledon is the oldest, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891, and the Australian in 1905. However, of these four, only Wimbledon was a major before 1924/25, the time when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments. The term Grand Slam also, and originally, refers to the achievement of winning all four major championships in a single calendar year within one of the five events: men's and women's singles; men's, women's, and mixed doubles. In doubles, one team may accomplish a Grand Slam playing together or one player may achieve it with different partners.

Winning the four majors in consecutive tournaments but not in the same year is known as a Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam, while winning all four majors at any point during the course of a career is known as a Career Grand Slam. Winning the gold medal at the Summer Olympic Games in addition to the four majors in a one calendar year is known as a "Golden Grand Slam" or more commonly the "Golden Slam". Also, winning the Year-End Championship (known as ATP World Tour Finals for men's singles and doubles disciplines, and WTA Tour Championships for both women's disciplines) in the same period is known as a "Super Slam". Together, all four Majors in all three disciplines (singles, doubles, and mixed doubles) are called a "boxed set" of Grand Slam titles. No male or female player has won all twelve events in one calendar year, although a "career boxed set" has been achieved by three female players during their careers. The term slam for winning all of the tricks in the  (see also whist terms) is attested from early in the 17th century.

Kieran is widely credited with first applying the term "grand slam" to tennis, to describe the winning of all four major tennis tournaments in a calendar year, sports columnist Alan Gould had used the term in that connection almost two months before Kieran.Gould, Alan (18 July 1933).

The possibility of being the reigning champion of all the current four Majors did not exist until 1924/25, when the International Lawn Tennis Federation designated the Australasian, French (before 1925 only open to members of French tennis clubs), British and American championship tournaments as the four Majors. Before that time only three events: Wimbledon, the World Hard Court Championships (held in Paris & once in Brussels) and the World Covered Court Championships (held in various locations) were considered the premier international tennis events by the ILTF. Tony Wilding of New Zealand won all three of those earlier majors in one year – 1913. It has been possible to complete a Grand Slam in most years and most disciplines since 1925. It was not possible from 1940 to 1945 because of interruptions at Wimbledon, the Australian and French opens due to the Second World War, the years from 1970 to 1985 when there was no Australian tournament in mixed doubles, and 1986 when there was no Australian Open at all. The first definitive Grand Slam, of the current four majors, was accomplished when Don Budge won all four men's singles Majors in 1938. To date, 17 players have completed a Grand Slam, though only six in the most prestigious singles titles. Of these players, three have won multiple Grand Slams: Rod Laver accomplished the feat twice in men's singles; Margaret Court accomplished the feat three times, in two different disciplines – once in women's singles and twice in mixed doubles; and Esther Vergeer completed a grand slam twice in Women's wheelchair doubles. The four Junior disciplines, boys' and girls' singles and doubles, provide limited opportunities to achieve a Grand Slam. Players are only eligible from age 13 to 18, with 18-year-olds likely to hold a physical advantage. Only Stefan Edberg has completed the Grand Slam in a Junior discipline.   Australian Open  French Open  Wimbledon Championships  US Open         In 1982 the International Tennis Federation (ITF) broadened the definition of the Grand Slam as meaning any four consecutive major victories, including the ones spanning two calendar years. As defined in the constitution of the ITF: "The Grand Slam titles are the championships of Australia, France, the United States of America and Wimbledon. Players who hold all four of these titles at the same time achieve the Grand Slam".2010 Constitution of the International Tennis Federation Limited.   As this definition differs from the original definition of the Grand Slam as restricted to a single calendar year, there has been some controversy towards this redefinition in the tennis world. Subsequently, the ITF has distanced itself from the 1982 decision, reverting to the traditional calendar-year definition (when Martina Navratilova won the 1984 French Open to become the reigning champion of all four women's singles, the ITF awarded her $1 million Grand Slam bonus in recognition of her achievement. However subsequently, the ITF abandoned recognizing non-calendar year grand slams. Combining the Grand Slam and non-calendar year Grand Slam, the total number of times that players achieved the feat (of being the reigning champion in all four majors) expands to 18. Laver was the most recent male grand-slammer even by this more relaxed definition until 2013, when the Bryan brothers won Wimbledon while holding the other majors. But Laver still is the most recent singles male grand-slammer. Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde reached the final of the 1997 French Open holding all the other three titles, but lost to Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Daniel Vacek; in singles, Roger Federer in 2006 and 2007 and Novak Djokovic in 2011 repeated this, both ultimately losing the Paris final to Rafael Nadal. Nadal himself was prevented from achieving this feat by his own countryman David Ferrer, who defeated him in the quarterfinal of the Australian Open 2011, with Nadal previously having won the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open in 2010. : Note: From 1977 to 1985, the Australian Open was held in December as the last Major of the calendar year. The career achievement of all four major championships in one discipline is termed a Career Grand Slam in that discipline. Dozens of players have accomplished that (column two) and 17 have doubled it: won a second championship in each of the four majors in one discipline (column three). Two or more career championships in all four majors is sometimes called a "Multiple Slam Set". Three players have Multiple Slam Sets in two disciplines, one in three disciplines, so 22 players are counted in the table (column three). Their achievements are tabulated below. Seven men and ten women have won Career Grand Slams in singles play (rows one and two); among them two men and five women have at least two Career Grand Slams in singles (column three). Since the beginning of the open era, four men and six women have achieved this (Rod Laver, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal; Margaret Court, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova). Several singles players have won three major championships without achieving the Career Grand Slam. Henri Cochet, Helen Wills, Althea Gibson, Tony Trabert and Margaret Osborne duPont never won the Australian Open. Frank Sedgman, Louise Brough Clapp, Pete Sampras, John Newcombe, Jimmy Connors, Lindsay Davenport, Martina Hingis and Novak Djokovic failed to win the French Open. Ken Rosewall, Hana Mandliková, Ivan Lendl, Monica Seles, Guillermo Vilas, Mats Wilander and Justine Henin failed to win Wimbledon.  Jean Borotra, Jack Crawford, Lew Hoad, and Evonne Goolagong Cawley never won the US Open. Only six players have completed a Career Grand Slams in both singles and doubles, one male (Roy Emerson) and five female (Margaret Court, Doris Hart, Shirley Fry Irvin, Martina Navratilova and Serena Williams). Court, Hart and Navratilova are the only three players to have completed a "Career Boxed Set", winning all four titles in singles, doubles and mixed doubles; this has never been done by a male player. The remainder of this section is a complete list, by discipline, of all players who have won the Career Grand Slam. Players are ordered chronologically by their completion of the Slam. Seven men have won the four grand slam tournaments. Two of the seven men achieved a double career Slam. Each woman's "first wins" in the four Majors are listed chronologically and their ages upon completion of the Slam are given in brackets. Five of the ten women achieved at least two career Slams, two of the ten have achieved three careers slams and Steffi Graf is the only player to achieve four career Slams. Note: From 1977 to 1985, the Australian Open was held in December as the last Major of the calendar year. At Men's Doubles, 21 players have won the career Slam including fourteen who "slammed" with one partner. The latter are listed first, as seven teams, ignoring any major wins with other partners. Five of the 21 men achieved at least a double career Slam at Men's Doubles, led by Roy Emerson and John Newcombe with triple Slams. Note: From 1977 to 1985, the Australian Open was held in December as the last Major of the calendar year. At Women's Doubles, 21 players have won the career Slam including ten who "slammed" with one partner. Eight of the 22 achieved at least a double career Slam at Women's Doubles, led by Martina Navratilova with seven or more titles in each Major. Note: From 1977 to 1985, the Australian Open was held in December as the last Major of the calendar year. At Mixed Doubles, a total of 15 players have won the career Slam, including five who "slammed" as a pair (won all four with same partner) — an odd number because Margaret Court has accomplished a career Grand Slam separately with Ken Fletcher and Marty Riessen. The other two of the five are Doris Hart and Frank Sedgman. Also three of the 15 players have accomplished multiple career Grand Slams in mixed doubles, led by Margaret Court's quadruple Slam. Wheelchair tennis Grand Slams are possible only in men's doubles and women's doubles. Wheelchair tennis Grand Slams are possible only in men's doubles and women's doubles.

Team: Player: Team and Player: Team: Player: Player: Team: Player: Helen Wills Moody won all 16 of the Grand Slam singles tournaments she played beginning with the 1924 U.S. Championships and extending to the 1933 Wimbledon Championships (not counting her defaults in the 1926 French and Wimbledon Championships). The first 15 of those were won without losing a set. During this period, she won 6 Wimbledons, 4 French Championships, and 6 U.S. Championships. She also won the 1924 Summer Olympics during this period. Moody never entered the Australian Championships. Doris Hart won all 13 of the Grand Slam mixed doubles tournaments she played beginning with the 1951 French Championships and extending to the 1955 U.S. Championships. During this period, she won 5 Wimbledons, 3 French Championships, and 5 U.S. Championships. Tennis was an Olympic sport from the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics through the 1924 Games, then was dropped for the next 64 years (except as a demonstration sport in 1968 and 1984) before returning in 1988. As there were only three Major championships designated by the International Lawn Tennis Federation before 1925, none of the tennis players who participated in the Olympics between 1896 and 1924 had a chance to complete a Golden Grand Slam. However although it didn't occur, there was a possibility to complete a Career Golden Grand Slam by winning the 1920 Olympics or 1924 Olympics plus each of the four grand slams, all of which were present from 1925 onwards. The term Golden Slam (initially "Golden Grand Slam") was coined in 1988. Only one player has completed the Golden Slam:  Steffi Graf (1988 Australian Open, 1988 French Open, 1988 Wimbledon Championships, 1988 US Open & 1988 Olympic gold medal) Winning four consecutive Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic event in the period of twelve months, although not in one year is called a Non-calendar year Golden Slam. Only Bob and Mike Bryan have achieved this by winning the 2012 Olympics, 2012 US Open, 2013 Australian Open, 2013 French Open and 2013 Wimbledon Championships. After they won the final at Wimbledon, this was coined the  "Golden Bryan Slam". A player who wins all four Grand Slam tournaments and the Olympic gold medal during his or her career is said to have achieved a Career Golden Slam. Serena Williams is the only player to have achieved a career golden slam in both singles and doubles. In 1970 a tournament was created to reunite the top male players of the season, which is today called the ATP World Tour Finals. In 1972 the women's tour introduced the same concept, now known as the WTA Tour Championships. Both are contested at the end of the year and are the last official competitions of the ATP and WTA seasons. Winning this event along with the four Grand Slams and the Olympic gold medal is nowadays known as completing the Super Slam.Kay, Dimitri (22 November 2010).  But this achievement has only been possible since 1988, when tennis returned to the Olympic calendar. No player has ever completed the Super Slam in one season. Only one player has completed the Super Slam in the period of twelve months:  Steffi Graf (1987 WTA Tour Championships, 1988 Australian Open, 1988 French Open, 1988 Wimbledon Championships, 1988 US Open & 1988 Olympic gold medal) *Note: Although Serena Williams held all 4 majors (winning consecutively all 4 majors from the 2014 US Open to the 2015 Wimbledon), the 2012 Olympic Gold and the 2014 WTA Tour Championships at the same time, it isn't considered a Non-calendar year Super Slam for not having been accomplished in a 12-month period. The following players have completed the Super Slam during their career: Players who have won three of the four Grand Slam tournaments in the same year. Jack Crawford, Lew Hoad, Martina Navratilova and Serena Williams won the first three events, but lost the last grand slam tournament.In 1984, the Australian Open was the last event held, rather than the first. Crawford, an asthmatic, won two of the first three sets of the 1933 U.S. Championships final against Fred Perry, then tired in the heat and lost the last two sets and the match.        : 1984: Australian Open, Wimbledon, US Open : 1988: French Open, Wimbledon, US Open : 2004: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon : 1983: French Open, Wimbledon, US Open Simon Youl : 1983: French Open, Wimbledon, US Open : 1988: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon Todd Woodbridge : 1988: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon : 1994: Australian Open, Wimbledon, US Open : 2004: Australian Open, Wimbledon, US Open : 2004: Australian Open, Wimbledon, US Open : 1987: French Open, Wimbledon, US Open : 1990: Australian Open, French Open, US Open : 1982: French Open, Wimbledon, US Open : 1995: Australian Open, French Open, US Open : 1995: Australian Open, French Open, US Open : 2005: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon : 2006: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon : 2007: French Open, Wimbledon, US Open     Winning singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles at one Grand Slam event is called a Triple Crown. It has become a rare accomplishment in tennis. This is partly because the final match in all three disciplines often takes place concurrently in the same day if not in consecutive days. Doris Hart for example attained her first Triple Crown after playing three Wimbledon final matches held in one single day. Notes:   Another Grand Slam-related accomplishment is winning a "boxed set" of Grand Slam titles – which is at least one of every possible type of Major championship available to a player: the singles, doubles, and mixed doubles at all four Grand Slam events of the year. This has never been accomplished within a year or consecutively across two calendar years. The Career Boxed set refers to winning a set of all possible grand slam titles over the course of an entire career. No male player has completed this. Men who participate in top/elite level singles have played comparatively few doubles, and very few mixed doubles. So far, only three women have completed the boxed set during their careers: Court is not only unique in having two boxed sets, but is also unique in the timing of her accomplishments. Her first boxed set was completed before the start of the open era, and she has a boxed set achieved solely within the open era. Serena Williams and Martina Hingis have come closer than any other currently active player to joining this elite group. Both of them miss just two titles. Williams has yet to win the mixed doubles at the Australian and French Opens (finishing as the runner-up at the 1999 Australian Open and 1998 French Open), while Hingis needs the French Open singles and mixed doubles titles (finishing runner-up in singles at the 1997 and 1999 French Opens). Prior to Williams and Hingis, it was Billie Jean King who came close at completing a career boxed set. She only needed the Australian Open women's doubles title and although she reached the final twice (in 1965 and 1969), she failed to win the title. Of the many players who have managed to win a full set of four Majors, there is a small number who have gone on to win all four Majors a second or more times. The completion of "Multiple Career Grand Slams" or sometimes called "multiple slam sets" (MSS) has been achieved by only 22 unique players up to the end of the 2015 Wimbledon. MSS players can be found in each of the five tennis disciplines: men's or women's singles, men's or women's doubles, mixed doubles. It can also be found in women's wheelchair doubles. Of these, five players have completed MSS in more than one discipline: Roy Emerson, Martina Navratilova, Frank Sedgman and Serena Williams have MSS in two disciplines, Margaret Court has MSS in three disciplines. This table shows each multiple occurrence of a complete MSS for each of the players who have accomplished multiple slams in a particular tennis discipline. The year shown for each of the four Majors is the year that particular Major win was repeated as part of that player's achievement of their second (all 22 players) and third (8 players) and fourth (4 players) and fifth through seventh (Martina Navratilova, in women’s doubles) complete slam set of Major wins. For example, the fourth row shows that Margaret Court completed her third career slam set in Women's Singles —winning each of the four majors three times— during the 1970 Wimbledon Championships (bold). More specific, she won: Australian open 11 times, the third in 1962; French Open five times, the third in 1969; Wimbledon three times (determines the maximum of sets), the third in 1970 and finally US Open five times, the third in 1969. Grey background shades lesser achievements by the same player in the same discipline (e.g., Court in the eighth row); yellow highlights the greatest achievement in the discipline (e.g., Graf in the third row). By discipline (numbers of players and table entries) Before the Open Era began in 1968, only amateur players were allowed to compete in the four majors. Many male top players "went pro" in order to win prize money legally, competing on a professional world tour comprising completely different events. From 1927 through 1967, the three oldest pro events were considered "majors" of the pro tour: the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, French Pro Championship and Wembley Championships. A player who won all three in a calendar year was considered to achieve a "Professional Grand Slam", or "Pro Slam". The feat was accomplished twice:  Ken Rosewall in 1963;  Rod Laver in 1967.

The French Championship tennis tournament at the time was a domestic competition not recognized as an international major. At the time the major clay court event (actual precursor of the French Open in its current international format) was the World Hard Court Championships, where Suzanne Lenglen also attained triple championship in 1921 and 1922). Also the 1941 triple championship of Alice Weiwers is not listed due to its disputed official status: French championships held in Vichy France from 1941 to 1945 are currently not recognized by Fédération Française de Tennis.
