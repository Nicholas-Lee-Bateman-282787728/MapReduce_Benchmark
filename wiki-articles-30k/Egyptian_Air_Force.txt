   The Egyptian Air Force (EAF) (, ), is the aviation branch of the Egyptian Armed Forces. The EAF is headed by an Air Marshal (Lieutenant General equivalent). Currently, the commander of the Egyptian Air Force is Air Marshal Younes Hamed. The force's motto is 'Higher and higher for the sake of glory' (, ). The Egyptian Army Air Service was formed in 1932, and became an independent air force in 1937. It had little involvement in the Second World War.  From 1948 to 1973 it took part, with generally mediocre results, in four separate wars with Israel, as well as the quasi-War of Attrition.  It also supported the Egyptian Army during the North Yemen Civil War and the Libyan-Egyptian War of 1977. From 1977 to 2011 it saw virtually no combat, but has participated in numerous exercises, including Operation Bright Star since 1985.  In recent years the Air Force has acted in the Sinai Insurgency, the Libyan Civil War and the Intervention in the Yemen. The Air Force's backbone are 220 F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters. The Egyptian Air Force is the 4th largest operator of F-16s in the world, after the United States, Israel, and Turkey.  In late 1928, the Parliament of Egypt proposed the creation of an Egyptian Air Force. The Egyptian ministry of war announced that it needed volunteers for the new arm to become the first four Egyptian military pilots.  Over 200 Egyptian officers volunteered, but in the end only three succeeded in passing strict medical tests and technical examinations. These three went to RAF Station Abu Sueir Royal Air Force No 4 Flying Training School (No 4 FTS) located near the Suez Canal, where they were trained on a variety of aircraft. After graduation, they travelled to the United Kingdom for specialised training.  On 2 November 1930, the King of Egypt and Sudan, Fuad I announced the creation of the Egyptian Army Air Force (EAAF). On 27 May 1931 the Egyptian Council of Ministers approved the purchase of five aircraft and the building of an airfield at Almaza with a budget of 50,000 pounds. The aircraft chosen was the British de Havilland Gipsy Moth trainer, the five modified aircraft were flown from England to Egpyt and on arrival in May 1932 the air force was founded and the Almaza airfield was formally opened. The first commander of the EAAF was Squadron Leader Victor Hubert Tait RAF, a Canadian, former Senior Air Advisor on the British Military Mission in Egypt.  Tait selected staff, weapons and built a number of airfields.  In 1934 the British government provided ten Avro 626 aircraft, which were the first real Egyptian military planes.  A further 17 626s together with Hawker Audaxes for army cooperation and close support and Avro Ansons for VIP work followed shortly afterward. In 1937 the Egyptian Army Air Force was separated from the Army Command and became an independent branch named the Royal Egyptian Air Force (REAF).  New stations were built in the Suez Canal Zone, and the Western Desert. During 1938 the REAF received two squadrons of Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters and a squadron of then-modern Westland Lysander reconnaissance aircraft, Egypt was the last state to use the Lysander in action, during the Palestine War of 1948. As the Egyptian border was threatened by an Italian and German invasion during the Second World War, the Royal Air Force established more airfield in Egypt.  The Royal Egyptian Air Force was sometimes treated as a part of the Royal Air Force, at other times a  strict policy of neutrality was followed as Egypt maintained its official neutrality until very late in the war.  As a result, few additional aircraft were supplied by Britain, however the arm did receive its first modern fighters, Hawker Hurricanes and a small number of Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks.  In the immediate post-war period, cheap war surplus aircraft, including a large number of Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IXs were acquired. A roughly 1946 order of battle for the Air Force can be found in Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II.   Following the British withdrawal from the British Protectorate of Palestine and the establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, Egyptian forces crossed into Palestine as part of a wider Arab League military coalition in support of the Palestinians against the Israelis.  The Egyptian Air Force contribution included the Short Stirling bomber, Douglas C-47 Dakotas performing as light bombers and Spitfires. Two Israeli aircraft were shot down and on 22 May 1948, Egyptian Spitfires attacked the RAF airfield at Ramat David, believing the airfield had already been taken over by Israeli forces.  The first raid surprised the British, and resulted in the destruction of several RAF aircraft on the ground, and the deaths of four airmen.  The British were uncertain whether the attacking Spitfires had come from Arab or Israeli forces. When second and third raids followed shortly afterwards, the British were ready and the entire Egyptian force was shot down – the last aircraft being baited for some time as the RAF pilots attempted to get a close look at its markings. Relations with Britain were soon restored and the official state of war with Israel ensured that arms purchases continued.  New Spitfire Mk. 22s were purchased to replace the earlier models.  In late 1949, Egypt received its first jet fighter, the British Gloster Meteor F4 and shortly after de Havilland Vampire FB5s.  The Egyptians made continuous attempts to purchase heavy arms from Czechoslovakia years before the 1955 deal. The Egyptian Government was determined to move away from reliance on British armaments. In 1955, under President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt began acquiring weaponry, including  aircraft, from the Soviet Union. Initial Soviet deliveries included MiG-15 fighters, Ilyushin Il-28 bombers, Il-14 transports, and Yak-11 trainers. Instructors from Czechoslovakia accompanied these aircraft.  This period in the Egyptian Air Force's history also yielded the first indigenous aircraft production as the country began manufacturing its own Czechoslovak-designed Gomhouria Bü 181 Bestmann primary trainers.   After the Egyptian Government's nationalisation of the Suez Canal in 1956, Egypt was attacked by Israel, France, and the United Kingdom in what came to be known as the Suez Crisis.  Heavy losses were sustained by the Egyptian side.  The conflict, though devastating militarily, turned out to be a political victory for Egypt, and resulted in the total withdrawal of the tri-nation aggressor forces from the country.  It also forced the EAF to begin rebuilding with non-British help. In 1958, Egypt merged with Syria to form the United Arab Republic, and the previously separate Egyptian, and Syrian forces were combined as the United Arab Republic Air Force. Though Syria left the union in 1961, Egypt continued to use the union's official name until 1971, including for its air force.  By the mid-1960s, British aircraft had been replaced completely by Soviet hardware.  The Soviet Union became the principal supplier of the EAF, and many other Arab states.  This allowed the EAF to greatly modernise and boost its combat effectiveness. The MiG-21 Fishbed arrived in the early 1960s, bringing with it a Mach 2 capability. The MiG-21 would remain Egypt's primary fighter for the next two decades. In 1967, Egypt had 200 MiG-21s. The EAF also began flying the Sukhoi Su-7 fighter/bomber in the mid-1960s. Egypt also began the Helwan HA-300 as its first supersonic aircraft. It never went beyond its 3 prototypes and initial test flights, then was abandoned due to high military cost inflicted upon the Egyptian military involvement in the Yemen War and the defeat in the 1967 war with Israel.  The Yemeni Royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, while the Yemeni Republicans were supported by Egypt. The fighting was fierce, featuring heavy urban combat as well as battles in the countryside. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. Strategically, the Yemen War was an opportunity for Israel.  It stagnated Egyptian military plans for the reinforcement of Sinai, by shifting the Egyptian military focus to another theater of operation.  Egyptian historian Mohammed Heikal writes that Israel provided arms shipments and also cultivated relationships with hundreds of European mercenaries fighting for the Royalists in Yemen.  Israel established a covert air-supply bridge from Djibouti to North Yemen.  The war also gave the Israelis the opportunity to assess Egyptian combat tactics and adaptability. Egyptian air and naval forces began bombing and shelling raids in the Saudi southwestern city of Najran and the coastal town of Jizan, which were staging points for royalist forces. In response, the Saudis purchased a British Thunderbird air defense system and developed their airfield in Khamis Mushayt. Riyadh also attempted to convince the United States to respond on its behalf.  President Kennedy sent only a wing of jet fighters and bombers to Dhahran Air base, demonstrating to Egypt the seriousness of his commitment to defending U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia.  In the 1967 Six-Day War the EAF's combat capacity was severely damaged after the Israeli Air Force destroyed its air bases in a preemptive strike codenamed Operation Focus.  During the last four days the EAF conducted only 150 sorties against Israeli units throughout the Sinai.Kenneth M. Pollack, Mark Grimsley, Peter Maslowski, Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948–1991,University of Nebraska Press, 2004 p.170 After the war, the Soviet Union replenished EAF stocks, sending large numbers of aircraft and advisors to Egypt to revitalise the EAF.  The years between 1967 and 1970 involved a prolonged campaign of attrition against Israel. The EAF went through a massive construction program to build new air bases in order to increase its survivability. During this period Egypt also received replacements for losses it suffered during the Six Day War.  The EAF was the first branch of the Egyptian armed forces to achieve full combat readiness. On 15 July 1967, six Israeli Mirage III fighters violated Egyptian airspace and orders were given for two formations each  consisted of two MiG-21 fighters to intercept, another formation of 2 MiGs piloted by Major Fawzy Salama & Lieutenant Medhat Zaki was ready in West Cairo airbase. Indeed, the formation took off, but for protecting the airbase rather than supporting the interception. However Maj. Fawzy insisted on supporting the Egyptians already engaging Israeli fighters and ordered his wingman to follow him. Once the reinforcement arrived Israeli Mirages immediately broke out of the fight.   The EAF was involved in the raid with over 220 aircraft taking part in the initial phase. Unlike their Syrian counterparts, EAF aircraft evaded Israeli radars by flying below detection height. EAF aircraft were held in reserve after that point, mainly concentrating on airfield defence in conjunction with the SA-3 'Goa', while the more mobile SA-6 'Gainful' protected Egyptian forces at low and medium level, aided by the ZSU-23-4SP and shoulder-held SA-7 SAMs. Despite these limitations, the EAF conducted offensive sorties from time to time. The Su-7BM was used for quick strafe attacks on Israeli columns and the Mirage IIIE (sometimes confused with the Mirage 5), donated by Libya, carried out long-range attacks deep inside Sinai at Bir Gifgafa. However, when Israeli armoured forces used a gap between the two Egyptian armies to cross the Suez Canal (Operation Stouthearted Men), they destroyed several Egyptian SAM sites, forcing the EAF into battle against the IAF. The EAF claimed victories and continued to contest IAF operations, while also launching attacks on Israeli ground forces on the East Bank of the Suez Canal. In most of these engagements, Egyptian MiG-21s (of all types) challenged Israeli Mirage IIICJs or Neshers.  The IAF did not operate freely and did not have complete air supremacy it enjoyed during the previous conflict, the 1967 war. Egyptian MiGs were used with better efficiency than before which included the tactics and lessons learned from the 1967 war. It was during this war that the EAF applied the lessons it earlier learnt from the Israelis. A 32-year-old deputy MiG-21 regiment commander who has been flying since he was 15 recalls: "During the war of attrition, the Israeli air force had a favorite ambush tactic", he told Aviation Week and Space Technology. "They would penetrate with two aircraft at medium altitude where they would be quickly picked up by radar, We would scramble four or eight to attack them. But they had another dozen fighters trailing at extremely low altitude below radar coverage. As we climbed to the attack they would zoom up behind and surprise us. My regiment lost MiGs to this ambush tactic three times. But we learned the lesson and practiced the same tactics. In the final fights over Deversoir, we ambushed some Mirages the same way, and my own 'finger four' formation shot down four Mirages with the loss of one MiG."  On 14 October 1973, Israel launched a large scale raid with over 250 aircraft – F-4 Phantoms and A-4 Skyhawks – attempting to hit the large air base at el-Mansourah. It culminated in an almost continuous dogfight lasting no less than 53 minutes. According to Egyptian estimates over 180 aircraft were involved at one time, the majority belonging to the Israelis. At 10&nbsp;pm local time, Cairo Radio broadcast "Communiqué Number 39", announcing that there had been several air battles that day over a number of Egyptian airfields, that most intensive being over the northern Delta area. It also claimed that 15 enemy aircraft had been downed by Egyptian fighters for the loss of three Egyptian aircraft, while an even greater number of Israelis had been shot down by the Army and the Air Defense Forces over Sinai and the Suez Canal. For its part, Israel Radio claimed, early the following morning, that the IAF had shot down 15 Egyptian aircraft, a figure subsequently reduced to seven. Later on, the Egyptian Government changed the country’s "Air Force Day" from 2 November to 14 October, to commemorate the Mansourah air battle.  During the Shaba I crisis in Zair on 1977, Egyptian Air Force provided 50 pilots and technicians, which operated Mirage jets from the Zairian Air Force.  During the 1977 Libyan-Egyptian War, there were some skirmishes between Libyan and Egyptian fighters. In one instance, two Libyan Air Force MiG-23MS engaged two EAF MiG-21MFs that had been upgraded to carry Western weaponry. The Libyan pilots made the mistake of trying to manoeuvre with the more nimble Egyptian fighters, and one MiG-23MS was shot down by EAF Maj. Sal Mohammad, while the other Libyan aircraft used its speed advantage to escape.  The Egyptian Air Force operated on a large scale during the Sinai insurgency which commenced in 2011. AH-64 Apache helicopters and F-16 jet fighters bombed numerous militant targets on almost a daily basis. During the 2014 Libyan Civil Conflict there were conflicting reports that Egyptian warplanes bombed Islmaist militias in support of the government based in Tobruk. The foreign ministry denied any involvement in the conflict although unnamed Egyptian military officials claimed otherwise.  On the dawn of 16 February 2015, Egyptian war planes launched an intensive air strike on multiple Islamic State positions that included weapons caches and training camps. The air strikes came in response for the execution of 21 Egyptian workers by masked militants affiliated to the Islamic State. The Egyptian airstrikes killed 64 Islamic State fighters, including three of the leadership, in the coastal cities of Derna and Sirte, the Libyan army said.  As a part of a Saudi-led joint regional military operation, the Egyptian Air Force participated in airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen. The Egyptian air force supported pro-government forces when they attacked al-Anad airbase south of Yemen. "EAF and paratroopers aerial supported Yemeni ground forces who have now seized the military base killing scores of Houthi rebels.    Since 1977 the Air Force has seen little active service. Perhaps its most intense training opportunity has become Operation Bright Star, a U.S. Central Command exercise. From 1985 onwards the air forces of both the U.S. and Egypt started participating in what was previously an Army only bilaterial exercise. Starting in 1987 the Navies and Special Operations Forces from both countries have also taken part in the exercise. At least nine other states now take part.  The Camp David Accords caused a gradual change in the overall composition of the EAF. The EAF began to rely more on US, French and in some cases on Chinese aircraft. The addition of these aircraft from multiple sources along with the ones already in the EAF inventory caused increasing serviceability problems. In 1982, the EAF began receiving F-16 fighters under the Peace Vector Program. As of 2015, the EAF received a total of 220 F-16s. 18 aircraft were lost in accidents and 7 F-16A/Bs were grounded. These grounded F-16A/Bs were later overhauled, upgraded and returned to active service, additional F-16s were acquired to replace those lost. In 1986, the EAF received the French Mirage 2000 fighters, one was lost in a training accident. Egypt also license-built Alphajets, Tucano airplanes and Westland Gazelle helicopters. In 1987 the E-2C Hawkeye Airborne Early Warning (AEW) entered service and was upgraded with advanced AN/APS-145 radars. The EAF also upgraded its F-16 fighters to C/D standard that enabled them to fire the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile. The EAF currently operates 46 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters 36 of which were initially delivered as the AH-64A variant but were later upgraded to AH-64D standard.Boeing: Boeing, U.S. Army Sign Contract for 35 Egyptian AH-64D Apaches On 22 May 2009, Egypt requested the purchase of 36 Apache Arrowhead sensor systems as part of an order for 12 Block II AH-64D Apache helicopters. The number was later reduced to 10 Helicopters. The Egyptian Navy recently received the SH-2G Seasprite to supplement their Sea King and Gazelle helicopters.Scramble on the Web – Egyptian Air Force 74 Grob G-115's and 120 K-8 Karakorum trainers were also ordered.  During the late 1990s, then Air Marshal Ahmed Shafik (the former Civil Aviation minister until 2011) outlined an ambitious modernization program for the Egyptian Air Force in the 21st century. The EAF planned to obtain the modern technology it needed to deter any foreign aggression, help its allies and protect national security interests. This modernization included the integration of space and air reconnaissance systems, acquisition of airborne command and control capability, aerial refueling capability, advanced next generation fighters and heavy transport aircraft. Egypt made several deals with Ukrainian companies for the modernization of its old MiG-21 fleet but these deals were not implemented and no future plans to modernize the fleet of Mig-21s were put in place. On 3 March 2010, The EAF ordered 20 Lockheed Martin F-16C/D Block 52 aircraft.Egyptian Military Purchase. The contract was set to complete in 2013 and included 16 single-seat F-16C and four twin-seat F-16D aircraft.  On 14 August 2012, the US pushed the F-16 project for to ensure full cooperation with the new military leadership. The Defense Department awarded a major contract to facilitate the procurement of F-16s by the EAF. The Pentagon selected American International Contractors for a $66.6 million contract to upgrade infrastructure for Egypt’s order of 20 F-16 Block 52 aircraft, estimated at $2.2 billion. On 24 July 2013, the U.S. announced it would halt deliveries of the F-16s in response to the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état.Obama halts delivery of four F-16 jets to Egypt amid unrest - NBCnews.com, 24 July 2013 In March, 2015 the US announced the resumption of the deliveries of the F-16s, the last of which was delivered in October, 2015.http://egypt.usembassy.gov/pr103016.html On 16 February 2015, Egypt became the Rafale's first international customer when it officially ordered 24 Rafales, as part of a larger deal (including a FREMM multipurpose frigate and a supply of missiles) worth US$5.9&nbsp;billion (€5.2&nbsp;billion). In July 2015, the official ceremony, marking the acceptance by Egypt of its first 3 Rafales, was held at the Dassault Aviation flight test center in Istres. In January 2016, Egypt received three more Rafale fighters, raising the number of Rafales in service to six.  All six aircraft are two-seat models and were diverted from delivery to the French Air Force; Egypt's total 24-plane order is for 8 single-seat models and 16 two-seaters.  In April 2014, it was reported that Egypt plans to order 24 MiG-35 fighters as part of an arms deal. MiG head Sergei Korotkov said at the 2015 Aero India exposition they will provide the fighters if Egypt orders them and are ready to negotiate.Russia Ready to Supply MiG-35 Jets to Egypt - Manufacturer Russia agreed on a contract with Egypt for 46 MiG-35 fighters and is expected to be worth up to $2 billion. Russia plans to supply the Egyptian MiG-35s with 40 high precision targeting pods. Deliveries would begin in 2016. Russia and Egypt signed a contract for delivery of 50 Ka-52 helicopters. The Ka-52 will be equipped with the new OES-52 targeting system allowing it to launch Vikhr and Ataka anti-tank missiles using laser target direction systems. The execution of the contract will start in 2016 until 2018. SAGEM and AOI-Aircraft Factory have signed a collaboration agreement concerning the Patroller UAV. AOI-Aircraft Factory could handle final assembly of the drones and will develop a dedicated training center in Egypt to train staff for the operation and maintenance of the drone systems.  Egypt is in an advanced stage of negotiations for the purchase of the Russian strategic airlifter Il-76MD-90A. The first export contracts of the aircraft will be signed within 4–6 months after the MAKS-2015 Airshow. Airbus Defence and Space received from Egypt its first order of A400M. Egypt asked the company to have the A400M as soon as possible. Rosoboronexport and the Russian Helicopters holding are engaged in consultations with their Egyptian partners concerning a possible acquisition of Kamov Ka-52K ship-based helicopters for the 2 Mistral-class helicopter carriers that Egypt has agreed to buy from France. An Egyptian Air Force delegation had access to the helicopter before the official opening of the MAKS- 2015. The Egyptian Navy is under negotiations for the purchase of a significant number of NH90 helicopters. Egypt may choose between the tactical transport (TTH) and naval (NFH) versions, or a mix of the two. The NFH can operate from Gowind-class corvettes or FREMM frigates, and both variants can be based on Mistral-class helicopter carriers. Egypt plans to purchase two French military satellites. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is working towards signing a deal with Thales Alenia Space to purchase an observation satellite and a military telecommunications satellite. The contract of the deal amounts to approximately one billion euros for the two satellites.   |- | Aero L-59 Super Albatros || Czechoslovakia || Jet || Trainer ||  || 47 || 48 ||  |- | Alpha Jet || Egypt || Jet || Attack/trainer ||  || 45 || 45 ||  |- | Antonov An-74 || Ukraine || Jet || Transport ||  || 3 || 3 ||  |- | AgustaWestland AW109 || Italy || Rotorcraft || Utility ||  || 3 ||  ||  |- | AgustaWestland AW139 || Italy || Rotorcraft || Utility ||  || 2 ||  ||  |- | Beechcraft 1900 || USA || Jet || Transport/patrol ||  || 10 ||  ||  |- | Beechcraft Super King Air || USA || Jet || Transport ||  || 1 || 1 ||  |- | Boeing AH-64 Apache || USA || Rotorcraft || Attack ||  || 44 ||  || Boeing: Boeing, U.S. Army Sign Contract for 35 Egyptian AH-64D Apaches |- | Boeing CH-47 Chinook || USA || Rotorcraft || Transport ||  || 19 || 19 ||  |- | C-295 || Spain || Propeller || Transport ||  || 24 || 24 ||  |- | Chengdu J-7 || China || Jet || Fighter ||  || 60 || 150 ||  |- | DHC-5 Buffalo || Canada || Propeller || Transport ||  || 8 ||  ||  |- | Dassault Mirage 5 || France || Jet || Fighter || 1973 || 82 || 82 ||   |- | Dassault Mirage 2000 || France || Jet || Multirole ||  || 18 || 20 ||  |- | Dassault Rafale || France || Jet || Multirole ||  ||  6 || 6 ||  |- | EMB 312 Tucano || Egypt || Propeller || Trainer ||  || 54 || 134  ||  |- | Grob G-115 Tutor || Germany || Propeller || Trainer ||  || 74 ||  ||  |- | K-8 Karakorum || Egypt || Jet || Trainer ||  || 120 || 120 ||  |- | General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon || USA || Jet || Multirole ||  || 220 || 240 ||  |- | Lockheed C-130 Hercules || USA || Propeller || Transport ||  || 26 || 30 ||  |- | Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye || USA || Propeller || Patrol ||  || 9 ||  ||  |- | Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 || USSR || Jet || Fighter ||  || 56 || 490+ ||  |- | Mil Mi-8/Mil Mi-17 || USSR/Russia || Rotorcraft || Transport ||  || 60 ||  ||  |- | Aerospatiale SA-342 Gazelle || Egypt || Rotorcraft || Utility ||  || 90 || 108 ||  |- | Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprite || USA || Rotorcraft || Attack/patrol ||  || 13 ||  ||  |- | Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk || USA || Rotorcraft || Transport/utility ||  || 2 ||  ||  |- | Westland Sea King || UK || Rotorcraft || Transport/patrol ||  || 23 ||  ||  |}  |- | Mikoyan MiG-35 || Russia || Jet || Multirole || 2016 || 0 || 46 ||  |- | Kamov Ka-52 || Russia || Rotorcraft || Attack || 2017 || 0 || 46||  |- | Kamov Ka-52K || Russia || Rotorcraft || Attack || || 0 || ||  |}  |- | Airbus A400M Atlas || Spain || Propeller || Transport || || 0 || 12 ||  |- | Ilyushin Il-76 || Russia || Jet || Transport ||  || 0 ||  ||  |- | NHIndustries NH90 || France || Rotorcraft || Attack/patrol || || 0 ||  ||  |} In addition to Air Force aircraft, a number of aircraft are directly under government control to transfer the President of Egypt, presidential logistics, the Prime Minister and members of the government, including: The Roundel of the EAF consists of three circles, with the outside one being red, the middle one white, and the inner one being black, matching the Egyptian flag.
