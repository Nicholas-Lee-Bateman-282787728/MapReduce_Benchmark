  The South Australian National Football League (SANFL) is an Australian rules football league based in the Australian state of South Australia. It is also the governing body for the sport of Australian rules football in South Australia. Originally formed as the South Australian Football Association on 30 April 1877, the SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code in Australia and one of the oldest football competitions in the world, forming just a few years after the United Hospitals Challenge Cup (1874), the oldest rugby football competition, and over a decade before The Football League (soccer). Consisting of a single division competition, the season is an 18 round "home-and-away" (regular) season from April to September. The top five teams play off in a final series culminating in the grand final for the Thomas Seymour Hill Premiership Trophy.  The grand final had traditionally been held at Football Park in October, generally the week after the AFL Grand Final, though this was altered ahead of the 2014 season resulting in Adelaide Oval hosting the grand final in the penultimate weekend of September. The league owned the sub-licences for South Australia's two AFL clubs – Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club until March 2014, when South Australian Football Commission reached an agreement with the Adelaide and Port Adelaide football clubs – endorsed by the AFL – which will see the two AFL licences transferred to the clubs in return for payments totalling more than $18 million.SA FOOTBALL COMMISSION AND AFL AGREE TO TRANSFER OF CROWS AND POWER LICENCES The league is also responsible for the management of all levels of football in the state. This includes junior football, country football, amateur football and specific programs rolled out across schools, indigenous communities (including the APY Lands in the state's north) and newly arrived migrant communities. The SANFL owns the 51,240 seat AAMI Stadium (Football Park), formerly the largest stadium in South Australia. The stadium, which opened in 1974, was primarily used for Australian Football League matches up until 2013, though may occasionally be used for some SANFL and pre-season games. The stadium was the headquarters for the league from 1974-2013. The SANFL competition is the second highest attended Australian rules football league behind the AFL.  The earliest recorded football club in South Australia was Adelaide Football Club (SAFA) (unrelated to the modern day Adelaide Crows), formed in 1860.  The early years of football were poorly organised and dogged by argument over which set of rules to adopt.  In fact, after a match between Port Adelaide and Kensington in 1873, it was remarked that neither side understood the rules clearly.  However, as the years progressed, there became a growing push for uniformity and structure in South Australian football. packed Adelaide Football Club, formed in 1860, was the first in South Australia. (TEMPLATE) played its early games at Glanville Hall Estate from 1870 to 1879. In 1877, 12 of South Australia's football clubs met to develop a uniform set of rules and establish a governing body.  The South Australian Football Association was formed at a meeting at the Prince Alfred Hotel in King William Street, Adelaide4 Quarters, Issue No.4, pg 49, September/October 2008, Slattery Media on 30 April 1877,Page 5 of ''''League Football in South Australia'''' (circa 1978).

The inaugural 1877 season was contested by  8 clubs: South Park, Willunga, Port Adelaide, Adelaide, North Adelaide, Gawler, Bankers, Woodville, South Adelaide and Victorian. <center> {| class="wikitable"  ! colspan="8" |Founding clubs |- |[[Adelaide Football Club (SAFA)|Adelaide]] |Bankers |[[Kensington Football Club|Kensington]] |[[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] |[[South Adelaide Football Club|South Adelaide]] |[[South Park Football Club (SAFA)|South Park]] |[[Victorian Football Club (SAFA)|Victorian]] |Woodville |} </center>  Norwood joined the Association the following season in 1878, and went on to win the next six premierships.  Norwood, South Adelaide and Port Adelaide together won 23 of the first 24 premierships. South Park, Willunga, North Adelaide, Prince Alfred College, Gawler, Kapunda, Bankers, Woodville, and Victorian all left the Association within the first 10 years.  By 1886, the Association had been reduced from 12 to four clubs.  The Association experienced a resurgence in the late 1880s and early 1890s.  The addition of North Adelaide (1893), West Adelaide and West Torrens (1897) and only the demise of Adelaide (1893), meant the Association comprised six clubs by the turn of the century. In 1898, the [[Magarey Medal]] was awarded to the fairest and most brilliant player for the first time.  <gallery mode=packed> File:South_Adelaide_1877_premiership_team.png|{{SANFL SthA}} was a strong club in early years winning 8 premierships in the 19th century (1885 South Adelaide team pictured).

In 1902, Port Adelaide adopted its now famous black and white colours.  In 1907, the Association changed its name to the South Australian Football League.  Norwood and Port Adelaide continued their domination of the league, and were joined by West Adelaide and North Adelaide; between them, the four clubs won all premierships between 1901 and 1913.  West Adelaide followed three straight wooden spoons from 1904–06 with four out of the five premierships from 1908–1912, the most successful period in West Adelaide's history.  The SANFL maintained competition for the first two years of World War I, 1914 and 1915, with Sturt winning their first premiership in 1915, but from 1916 the competition was suspended and did not resume until 1919.  <gallery mode="packed"> File:1908_West_Adelaide_premiership_team.jpg|{{SANFL WestA}} won four SAFL premierships and two [[Championship of Australia|Championships of Australia]] between 1908 and 1912.

[[Glenelg Football Club|Glenelg]] became the newest addition to the league in 1921 and started poorly with five consecutive wooden spoons.  In 1927, the South Australian Football League was renamed the South Australian National Football League.  Port Adelaide won five premierships in the period 1919-1939, appearing in 12 grand finals.  The SANFL continued normal competition for the first few years of World War II, but from 1942 to 1944 operated on a reduced basis with clubs merged on a geographical basis – Port Adelaide / West Torrens, West Adelaide / Glenelg, Sturt / South Adelaide and Norwood / North Adelaide.  <gallery mode="packed"> File:Norwood_vs_Port_Adelaide,_1929_SANFL_Grand_Final,_Adelaide_Oval.jpg|Pictured above is the [[1929 SANFL Grand Final]] between {{SANFL Por}} and {{SANFL Nor}} who by this time had well and truly become the leagues premier rivals. <br/>See [[Port Adelaide-Norwood SANFL rivalry]]. File:Ken Farmer SANFL.jpg|[[Ken Farmer]] kicked a record 1,417 goals. </gallery>  === 1946–1969: Port Adelaide and Sturt rivalry === Straight after the War Sturt won their Second Premiership. The next three years were dominated by Norwood. Port Adelaide, led by [[Fos Williams]], dominated the 1950s winning seven premierships, including a record-equalling six in a row from 1954–59. This record, originally set by Norwood in 1883, still stands in the SANFL.  Port Adelaide continued their dominance of the competition in the early 1960s with three more premierships by 1965.  In 1964 the SANFL admitted two new clubs, [[Central District Football Club|Central District]] and [[Woodville Football Club|Woodville]].  Both clubs performed poorly, and many questioned the purpose of introducing two more teams, in particular Woodville, who were closely surrounded by existing clubs, Port Adelaide and West Torrens.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  A resurgent Sturt under coach [[Jack Oatey]] won five straight premierships from 1966–70, sharing a fierce rivalry with Port Adelaide whom they met in four consecutive Grand Finals.  <gallery align=center> File:Ian_McKay_Spectacular_Mark.jpg|[[Ian McKay (footballer)|Ian McKay]] of {{SANFL NthA}} leaps for a spectacular mark in the 1952 SANFL Grand Final. File:Jack_Oatey_Norwood.jpg|[[Jack Oatey]] won 10 premierships as a coach from a league record 777 games. </gallery>  === 1970–1979: Golden Era === Sturt began the 1970s by defeating Glenelg in a rain-affected Grand Final by 21 points. North Adelaide secured back-to-back premiership victories over Port Adelaide in 1971 and 1972 and defeated VFL premier Carlton by one point in the end-of-season [[Championship of Australia]] match.  Port Adelaide continued their success, winning two premierships themselves (1977, 1979), and finishing lower than 3rd only once for the decade. Other premiership winning clubs in the 1970s were Sturt (1970, 1974, 1976), Glenelg (1973), and Norwood (1975, 1978). On 4 May 1974, Central District and North Adelaide played the first game at newly opened Football Park at [[West Lakes, South Australia|West Lakes]].  SANFL moved its administration to the new stadium, and 58,042 attended the first Grand Final at the ground later that year, with Sturt defeating Glenelg by 15 points despite kicking into a stiff breeze in the last quarter after leading by 5 points at three-quarter time. The 1975 season was highlighted by Glenelg's score of 49.23 (317) against Central District, with a winning margin of 238 points which was larger, at that time, than the previous highest score ever recorded by a side in a single game. In 1976, Sturt defeated Grand Final favourites Port Adelaide by 41 points in front of a record ticketed Football Park crowd of 66,897. Norwood won the 1978 premiership in their centenary year by beating Sturt in the Grand Final by one point after Sturt had lost just one game for the entire season. During the 1970s, an increasing number of SANFL players moved to Victoria to play in the VFL competition.  <gallery mode=packed> File:Barrie_Robran_Statue.jpg|[[Barrie Robran]] helped [[North Adelaide Football Club|North]] become 1972 [[1972 Championship of Australia|Champions of Australia]]. </gallery>  === 1980–1989: VFL expansion and financial difficulties === Port Adelaide, Norwood and Glenelg dominated the SANFL in the 1980s, accounting for eight premierships. The exodus of quality players to the VFL continued in the 1980s.  In 1981 the VFL rejected a SANFL bid to enter a composite South Australian team to its competition.  The SANFL introduced a player retention scheme in 1988 in an attempt to maintain the quality of the competition in the face of falling attendances.  Night football was introduced in 1984 after floodlights were installed at Football Park.  === 1990–1999: Adelaide and Port Adelaide AFL entry === On 31 July 1990, Port Adelaide surprised the SANFL by making an independent bid to the join the AFL.  The SANFL was left with little option but to submit its own bid to enter the AFL.  In a thirty-minute meeting{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the SANFL formed the Adelaide Football Club.  While Port Adelaide had by far the largest supporter base in South Australia, it could not compete with the SANFL's offer of a composite club and the use of Football Park, and in November 1990, following a legal battle, the AFL announced the Adelaide Football Club had been granted a licence and would enter the competition in 1991.  The Adelaide Crows debuted in 1991 wearing the state colours of navy blue, red and yellow.  While the Adelaide Crows enjoyed crowds of over 40,000 every week and dominated local media coverage, crowds at local SANFL matches suffered substantially.  In 1994 after a tender process put to all the SANFL clubs, the Port Adelaide Football Club secured a licence to enter the AFL. The Port Adelaide chose the nickname of 'Power' since 'Magpies' was already used by Collingwood. Port Adelaide wished to maintain its presence (as the Magpies) in the SANFL, which was agreed to on the basis that Port Adelaide's SANFL and AFL entities operate independently. The club in the SANFL was renamed "Port Adelaide Magpies Football Club" to reflect this separation.  <gallery align=center> File:Graham_Cornes.jpg|[[Graham Cornes]] was {{SANFL Gle}} coach in 1990 and {{AFL Ade}}'s first coach in the AFL. </gallery>  === 2000–2009: Central District domination === There was a changing of the guard as the new century started. For more than 100 years one of Port Adelaide, Norwood, North Adelaide or Sturt appeared in every Grand Final. The year 2000 saw the two newest teams Central District and Woodville-West Torrens played off in the Grand Final. Central District appeared in every Grand Final from 2000 to 2009, collecting eight premierships (2000-1, 2003–5, 2007–2009).  Only Sturt (2002) and Woodville-West Torrens (2006) have interrupted Centrals' run during this period. Under-age divisions were restructured, with under 17 and under 19 competitions dissolved in favour of under 16 and under 18 leagues, the latter coming into line with Victoria's TAC Cup competition and under the sponsorship of McDonald's would be known as the Macca's Cup. The former would become the Macca's Shield, the season length is around half that of the other levels of competition. Night games would become a feature at Elizabeth Oval, with Central District hosting Saturday night matches from 2006.  [[File:As-east.jpg|thumb|center|{{SANFL Cen}}'s won nine Grand Finals at [[Football Park]] between 2000 and 2010. ]]  === 2010–present: Norwood resurgence and Adelaide Oval return === Central District appeared in the 2010 & 2011 Grand Finals, with a victory over Norwood for their ninth flag then a loss to Woodville-West Torrens. The 2012 season saw them exit the finals in straight sets after defeats by West Adelaide and then North Adelaide. The 2012 and 2013 premierships were both won by Norwood, firstly defeating West Adelaide by 49 points to win their 28th flag and then subsequently defeating North Adelaide by 40 points for their 29th flag. This was the first time Norwood had won back to back flags for 90 years, when coincidentally they also beat West Adelaide (1922) and North Adelaide (1923).  With Norwood and Elizabeth's night match experiment largely successful and popular, West Adelaide (2010), South Adelaide (2011) and Glenelg (2012) would follow suit by installing their own lighting systems at their respective grounds while Woodville-West Torrens had hoped to play under lights at Thebarton Oval, which to date have only done so once in 2012 during their premiership defence.  In 2011, AFL-based Port Adelaide and SANFL-based Port Adelaide Magpies merged in order to address losses at both clubs, however in 2013 the club announced that the Magpies would officially become the reserves team for Port's AFL players, joining the Adelaide Football Club in fielding a reserves team in the SANFL in time for the 2014 season. These moves caused some furore in some fan circles, especially from a minority of supporters of the Magpies who resolved to not support the Power. The 2013 Grand Final was the last SANFL match at AAMI Stadium, with SANFL league headquarters to remain at AAMI but the finals to return to the new and improved Adelaide Oval from 2014. Ahead of the 2014 season, the AFL-based [[Adelaide Football Club]] were granted a license to field a [[reserve team]] in the competition, increasing the number of teams in the league to 10.  As a result of the Magpies becoming the Power's reserve team, and the inclusion of the Crows reserves team in the SANFL in 2014, the other SANFL clubs will lose their AFL contracted players as those contracted to the Crows or Power will move to play exclusively for those clubs in either league.  [[File:Adelaide Oval, 2014.jpg|thumb|center|The 2014 SANFL Grand Final was the first time since 1973 that a premiership was decided at [[Adelaide Oval]].]]  ===Expansion plans=== There were suggestions in 2007 to include a Northern Territory team in the SANFL, following trial games between composite [[Northern Territory Football League]] teams and SANFL clubs.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/nt/stories/s1564282.htm Northern Territory Football League vs North Adelaide], abc.net.au</ref> Darwin and [[Alice Springs]] were cited as competing for a licence, with the Northern Territory government supporting Darwin and business people such as [[Dick Pratt]] supporting Alice Springs.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,,21988869-23211,00.html Storm brews over NT AFL team] from foxsports.com.au</ref><ref>[http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewRelease&id=2659&d=5 NT AFL Team Should be Based in Darwin] from newsroom.nt.gov.au</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/29/1965293.htm AFL Central Australia opposes Darwin-based team] from abc.net.au</ref> However, a composite Northern Territory side, [[Northern Territory Football Club]] eventually joined the [[Queensland Australian Football League]] in 2008.

Federal MP for [[Division of Makin|Makin]], [[Tony Zappia]] made this proposal in 2009, arguing that  "only one of nine (SANFL) sides is based north of [[Grand Junction Road]], yet a third of the city's population is in that region, and under the [[South Australian Government|State Government]]'s 30 year plan most of the growth is likely to be in the north."<ref>[http://city-north-messenger.whereilive.com.au/news/story/zappia-appeals-to-sanfl-set-up-a-club-in-the-northeast/ Zappia appeals to SANFL: set up a club in the northeast]</ref>  ==Clubs==  {| class="navbox wikitable sortable" style="width:100%; text-align:left" |- style="text-align:center;" !

Those recruited to these AFL clubs who had not previously played for an SANFL club were allocated to a club by means of a "mini-draft", or played as a "guest player" if they were not playing for their Adelaide based AFL club, and their SANFL club had a bye. AFL club listed players were required to play a minimum of five SANFL games for their club through the season in order to be eligible to play in the SANFL finals. This rule had been in effect since the Crows first entered the AFL in [[1991 AFL season|1991]].  From the 2014 season onwards and on a year-by-year reviewable basis, Adelaide and Port Adelaide will have reserves teams in the SANFL league division. The latter will play as the Magpies and maintain their records and history as Port Adelaide Football Club,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} with 15 dedicated SANFL players and the rest to be made up of Power-listed players. While the Crows will not take part in the other levels of competition, the SANFL reserves division will see a Magpies team under the banner of an "Academy" team, made up of players aged between 18-22 and any players from that pool of 15 that may be demoted.

The SANFL is classed as a semi-professional competition.  In 2008 the league had a [[salary cap]] of $400,000 (excluding service payments).<ref>[http://footysa.com/index.php?title=2007_Salary_Cap_Changes 2007 Salary Cap Changes], media release, FootySA</ref>  This is the second highest in Australia for an Australian rules football competition, after the AFL.  The [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) of the SANFL is Jake Parkinson, who replaced Leigh Wicker in the role in 2014.<ref>[http://www.sanfl.com.au/news/sanfl_news/2621/ SANFL announces new CEO]</ref>  ==SANFL Ladder== South Australian leagues (including the SANFL) award two points for a win, and one for a draw. Elsewhere in Australia generally four points are awarded for a win and two for a draw. In addition, percentage is calculated as "For" ÷ "For and Against" × "100". Elsewhere in Australia it is generally calculated as "For" ÷ "Against" × "100".  == Audience == The SANFL match-day program is called the [[South Australian Football Budget|Football Budget]] and is sold at all SANFL matches. A special edition is produced for the grand final.  The SANFL competition's "match of the round" was broadcast weekly in South Australia on [[ABC Southern]] ([[ABC1]] South Australia). Until early 2008, it was also broadcast nationally on [[ABC2]] television. In 2012, nationwide SANFL match replays resumed on [[ABC2]]. Match replays are also available nationally on [[ABC iView]]. In 2007, the SANFL measured a record 1,415,000 total television viewers.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.sanfl.com.au/news/sanfl_news/147/ 2008 SANFL Match Program announced], 29 November 2007, SANFL website</ref>  The SANFL competition is covered by local radio stations [[Life FM (Adelaide)|Life FM]] (live) and [[5RPH]] (live). [[ABC Local Radio]] and [[5AA]] broadcast the SANFL Finals Series.  In 2013, the SANFL signed a three-year deal with the [[Seven Network]] to broadcast weekly matches on [[7mate]] from the start of the 2014 season.<ref>[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/sanfl-returns-to-commercial-tv-in-2014-for-first-time-since-1991-after-signing-deal-with-channel-seven/story-fnii0294-1226786977720 SANFL returns to commercial TV in 2014 for first time since 1991 after signing deal with Channel Seven]</ref> Popular Seven News Adelaide sports presenter Mark Soderstrom, former Port Adelaide Magpies captain and [[5AA]] breakfast show personality Tim Ginevar, and former [[Fox Sports Australia|Fox Sports]] commentator John Casey (who spent time with Seven Adelaide during the 1980s and 1990s) will be the chief callers for the 2014 SANFL season. This marks the leagues return to commercial television for the first time since [[NWS (TV station)|Channel 9]] broadcast the SANFL in 1992.  ===Attendance=== Although SANFL crowds now competes heavily with the two AFL national league clubs, the SANFL still has the [[List of sports attendance figures|second highest attendance]] of any Australian rules football league and the highest attendance for any regional league of any football code.  It continues to publish attendance figures.  The record attendance for an SANFL fixture was set at the 1976 SANFL Grand Final between Sturt and Port Adelaide at Football Park which saw 66,987 crammed into the stadium, though some estimate the crowd to have been as high as 80,000 with thousands turned away at the gates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Finals|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/the_sanfl/grand_finals/|publisher=SANFL|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> The largest attendance for a minor round fixture was set in Round 19, 1988 for a double header at Football Park. 38,213 fans saw Sturt play Port Adelaide in the early game while reigning premiers North Adelaide faced ladder leaders Central District in the late game.<ref>[http://www.australianfootball.com Double Header Blues for Port]</ref> The record suburban ground attendance was an estimated 24,000 who saw Sturt and Norwood at [[Unley Oval]] on 9 June 1924.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36554762 |title=Spectacular Football|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=10 June 1924 |accessdate=11 August 2011 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> A verified attendance of 22,738 saw Port play Norwood at [[Alberton Oval|Alberton]] in Round 11, 1977*.  <small>* South Adelaide played Port Adelaide in front of 30,618 at the [[Adelaide Oval]] in Round 2, 1965. At the time the Adelaide Oval doubled as both league headquarters and South Adelaide's home ground. South Adelaide would move to [[Hickinbotham Oval]] in 1995. The Unley Oval record is for current SANFL team home grounds, though the figure was only an estimated amount. Unley Oval's confirmed record attendance of 22,015 was set in Round 9, 1968 for Sturt vs Port Adelaide.</small>  The following are attendance figures since 1991.  {| class="wikitable" |-

Trophy''', named after administrator [[Thomas Seymour Hill]].  The '''Stanley H. Lewis Memorial Trophy''', awarded annually since 1962, recognises the best combined record in all levels of SANFL competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanley H. Lewis Trophy|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/awards/stanley_h_lewis_trophy/|publisher=SANFL|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> The trophy is awarded to the best performed club across three grades of the competition – League, Reserves and Under 18, with 100 points allocated for a league win, 50 points for a reserves win and 50 points for an Under 18 win. In the event of a draw, half of the points allocated for a win in that grade are awarded to each club involved.<ref>{{cite web|title=North Adelaide wins 2014 Stanley H. Lewis Trophy|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/news/sanfl_news/2673/|publisher=SANFL|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>  === Individual ===  The [[Magarey Medal]] is awarded to the fairest and most brilliant player in the SANFL each season and is the oldest individual football award in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/the_sanfl/history_of_the_sanfl/|title=History of the SANFL}}</ref>  The medal was originated by and is named after [[William Ashley Magarey]] who, in 1897, was the inaugural chairman of the South Australian Football Association (as the SANFL was then known). In 1898, in an effort to stamp out rough play and improve respect of umpires, Magarey instituted the medal to be awarded to the player deemed by umpires to be the fairest and most brilliant for that season. The inaugural winner of the medal was Norwood's [[Alby Green]]. Magarey presented every medal until he died in 1929 with West Adelaide's [[Robert Snell]] the last to receive the medal during Magarey's life. The [[Magarey Medal]] is still awarded to the [[best and fairest|fairest and most brilliant]] SANFL player each season. The [[Reserves Magarey Medal]] recognises the standout performers in the seconds or Reserves. It is not unusual for the Reserves Magarey winner to play only half a season in the 'seconds' and the rest of the season in their club's league team.  The [[Ken Farmer Medal]], much like the Coleman Medal in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], is awarded to the league player with the most goals in a season. Named after North Adelaide and South Australia's most prolific goal-kicker [[Ken Farmer]] who ended his SANFL career with a still record 1,417 goals, the medal was introduced in 1981 with Port Adelaide's [[Tim Evans]] winning the inaugural award. Evans, who kicked 1,044 goals for the Magpies between 1975 and 1986, is the only player other than Farmer who has kicked over 1,000 goals in the SANFL.  There are also the McCallum and Tomkins Medals, which up until the 2008 season were awarded to the best and fairest players of the U-17 and U-19 divisions respectively. These awards were merged in 2009 when the two under-age competitions were replaced with an U-18's league, similar to those adopted in the [[West Australian Football League]] and the VFL's [[TAC Cup]]. The first winner of the newly created McCallum-Tomkins Medal was South Adelaide's Luke Bowd.  The [[Jack Oatey Medal]] is awarded to the player voted best on ground in the SANFL Grand Final, first awarded in the 1981 premiership decider to [[Russell Ebert]] of Port Adelaide. In the same year, the [[Fos Williams Medal]] was also commissioned to recognise the standout performer for South Australia in interstate football, the first of which was awarded to [[Peter Carey (Australian rules footballer)|Peter Carey]] of Glenelg. Despite State of Origin football disappearing from the AFL calendar in 1999, the medal continues to be awarded to the best player for the SANFL representative team in interstate football.  The [[Bob Shearman|R.O. Shearman Medal]], since its inception in 2000, is awarded to the player voted by the League's senior coaches on a 5-4-3-2-1 basis each game of the home-and-away season.<ref>[http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/news/2014-09-01/summerton-wins-coaches-award Summerton wins 2014 R.O. Shearman Medal as voted by the League's coaches]</ref>  The [[Bob Quinn (Australian footballer)|Bob Quinn]] Medal is awarded to the player voted best afield in the [[Anzac Day]] matches between the Grand Finalists of the previous year. Commissioned in 2002, the medal was first won by [[James Gowans (Australian footballer)|James Gowans]] of Central District.  Also in 2002, the SANFL created the [[South Australian Football Hall of Fame]] to recognise the players, coaches, umpires, administrators and journalists who had made a significant contribution in the SANFL.
