 John Richard Kasich (; born May 13, 1952) is an American politician. He was elected as the 69th and current Governor of Ohio in 2010, and reelected in 2014. On July 21, 2015, he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president in 2016.Easley, Jonathan. Kasich makes quick rise in polls, The Hill (August 2, 2015): "in the two weeks since he launched his presidential campaign, John Kasich has bypassed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other Republicans who have been in the race longer." Kasich served nine terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing  from 1983 to 2001. His tenure in the House included 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee and six years as chairman of the House Budget Committee. He was a key figure in passage of both welfare reform and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. He was a commentator on Fox News Channel, hosting Heartland with John Kasich from 2001 to 2007. He also worked as an investment banker, a managing director of Lehman Brothers' Columbus, Ohio, office. In the 2010 Ohio gubernatorial election, Kasich defeated Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. He was re-elected in 2014, defeating Democrat Ed FitzGerald in a landslide. Kasich was born in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, an industrial town near Pittsburgh. He is the son of Anne (Vukovich) and John Kasich, who worked as a mail carrier.http://www.croatiaweek.com/the-american-croat-running-for-president-of-the-united-states-of-america/ Kasich's father was of Czech descent, while his mother was of Croatian ancestry. Both his father and mother were children of immigrants. He has described himself as "a Croatian and a Czech". After attending public schools in McKees Rocks, Kasich enrolled at Ohio State University, where he joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. As a freshman he wrote a letter to President Richard Nixon describing concerns he had about the nation and requesting a meeting with the President. The letter was delivered to Nixon by the University's president Novice Fawcett and Kasich was granted a 20-minute meeting with Nixon in December 1970.Patricia Sellers (March 12, 2012) Ohio governor's career-making moment Fortune. ArchiveKasich, John. "Letter to Richard Nixon", Dayton Daily News (December 2, 1970). Earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Ohio State University in 1974, he went on to work as a researcher for the Ohio Legislative Service Commission. From 1975 to 1978, he served as an administrative assistant to then-state Senator Buz Lukens. In 1978, Kasich ran against Democratic incumbent Robert O'Shaughnessy for State Senate. A political ally of his remembers him during that time as a persistent campaigner: “People said, ‘If you just quit calling me, I’ll support you.'"Gomez, Henry.  "After some lean and mean years, a maverick goes mainstream in Congress: John Kasich 5.0", The Plain Dealer (March 13, 2014).  At age 26, Kasich won with 56% of the vote, beginning his four-year term representing the 15th district. Kasich was the youngest person ever elected to the Ohio Senate. One of his first acts as a State Senator was to refuse a pay raise. Republicans gained control of the State Senate in 1980; but Kasich went his own way, for example, by opposing a budget proposal he believed would raise taxes and writing his own proposal instead.   In 1982, Kasich ran for Congress in Ohio's 12th congressional district, which included portions of Columbus as well as the cities of Westerville, Reynoldsburg,  Worthington, and Dublin. He won the Republican primary with 83% of the vote and defeated incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman Bob Shamansky in the general election by a margin of 50%–47%. He was re-elected eight times after 1982, winning at least 64% of the vote each time. During his congressional career, Kasich was considered a fiscal conservative, taking aim at programs supported by Republicans and Democrats. He worked with Ralph Nader in seeking to reduce corporate tax loopholes. Kasich was a member of the House Armed Services Committee for 18 years. He developed a "fairly hawkish" reputation on that committee,Rebecca Kaplan, John Kasich: What does he stand for?, CBS News (August 17, 2015). although he "also zealously challenged" defense spending he considered wasteful.Sabrina Eaton, Kasich to tout foreign policy experience on presidential campaign trail, Cleveland Plain Dealer (August 14, 2015). Among the Pentagon projects that he targeted were the B-2 bomber program (teaming up with Democratic Representative Ron Dellums to cut the program, their efforts were partly successful)Michael Weisskopf & David Maraniss, Tell Newt to Shut Up (Simon & Schuster, 1996), pp. 102-03. and the A-12 bomber program (ultimately canceled by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney in 1991). He participated extensively in the passage of the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986, which reorganized the U.S. Department of Defense.James R. Locher, III & Sam Nunn, Victory on the Potomac: The Goldwater-Nichols Act Unifies the Pentagon (Texas A&M University Press, 2004), pp. 375, 423, 425. He also pushed through the bill creating the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which closed obsolete U.S. military bases, and successfully opposed a proposed $110 million expansion of the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War. He also "proposed a national commission on arms control" and "urged tighter controls over substances that could be used for biological warfare." Kasich said he was "100 percent for" the first Persian Gulf War as well as the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, but said that he did not favor U.S. military participation in the Lebanese Civil War or in Bosnia.Darrel Rowland, What we've found out about the foreign policy of a President Kasich, Columbus Dispatch (April 27, 2015). In 1997, with fellow Republican Representative Floyd Spence, he introduced legislation (supported by some congressional Democrats) for the U.S. to pull out of a multilateral peacekeeping force in Bosnia.A GOP Move To Bring Bosnia Troops Home: Reps. Kasich, Spence want to stop funds by Sept. 30, CNN (March 21, 1997). In the House, he supported the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, a Dellums-led initiative to impose economic sanctions against apartheid-era South Africa.  In 1993, he became the ranking Republican member of the House Budget Committee. In that position, he and other House Budget Committee Republicans proposed an alternative to President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction bill, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.Eric Pianin, Republican Alternative to Clinton Budget Includes Tax Relief for Parents, Washington Post (March 3, 1994). That proposal included funds to implement Republican proposals for health care, welfare, and crime control legislation and for a child tax credit. The Penny-Kasich Plan, named after Kasich and fellow lead sponsor Tim Penny, was supported by Republicans and conservative Democrats.House Approves Spending Cuts: Clinton Fends Off Call For Bigger Savings, Washington Post (November 23, 1993). It proposed $90 billion in spending cuts over five years, almost three times as much in cuts as the $37 billion in cuts backed by the Clinton administration and Democratic congressional leaders. About one-third ($27 billion) of the cuts in the Penny-Kasich cuts would come from means-testing Medicare, specifically by reducing Medicare payments to seniors who earned $75,000 or more in adjusted gross income.J. Craig Crawford, Budget-cutting Zeal Sends a Clear Message to Clinton, Orlando Sentinel (November 24, 1993). This angered the AARP, which lobbied against the legislation. Another $26 billion of the Penny-Kasich plan's cuts would have come from the U.S. Department of Defense and foreign aid, which led Secretary of Defense Les Aspin to say that the plan would destroy military morale. Another $27 billion in savings would have come from federal layoffs. The proposal was narrowly defeated in the House in a 219-213 vote. As ranking member of the Budget Committee, Kasich proposed his own health care reform plan as a rival to the Clinton health care plan of 1993 championed by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, but more market-based.Zeke J. Miller, Hillary Clinton Dined With John Kasich Over Healthcare Reform—In 1993, Time (July 23, 2015). As Time magazine wrote, "The Kasich plan would have covered all Americans by 2005, using a form of an individual mandate that would have required employees to purchase insurance through their employers. (The mandate was an idea initially supported by conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation.)" In 1994, Kasich was one of the Republican leaders to support a last-minute deal with President Bill Clinton to pass the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. After a series of meetings with Clinton's Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, who was also a long-time friend of Kasich, the assault weapons ban was passed when 42 Republicans crossed party lines and voted with the Democrats to ban assault weapons.Bipartisanship Was The Key In Getting Crime Bill Passed Broder, David. Chicago Tribune. 24 August 1994. His support of the assault-weapons ban angered the National Rifle Association, which gave Kasich an "F" rating in 1994 as a result. In 1995, when Republicans gained the majority in the United States Congress following the 1994 election, Kasich became chairman of the House Budget Committee. In 1996, he introduced the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act in the House, a major welfare reform bill signed into law by President Clinton.Eaton, Sabrina, Gov. John Kasich continues reform quest he started two decades ago: welfare to work, The Plain Dealer (January 27, 2015) During the 1996 presidential campaign, Republican nominee Bob Dole was reported to have considered Kasich as a vice presidential running mate but instead selected Jack Kemp, a former congressman and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.Bill Schneider, The Last Cookie on the Plate, CNN (April 16, 1996).

Berke, The President's Trial: Presidential Candidates Are Saying Little About Impeachment Trial, for Now, New York Times (February 7, 1999).  Kasich did not seek re-election in 2000, but instead decided in February 1999 to form an exploratory committee to run for President.Kasich forms exploratory committee to run for president, CNN (February 15, 1999). In March 1999 he announced his campaign for the Republican nomination. After very poor fundraising, he dropped out in July 1999, even before the Iowa Straw Poll, and endorsed Governor George W. Bush of Texas. After leaving Congress, Kasich went to work for Fox News, hosting Heartland with John Kasich on the Fox News Channel and guest-hosting The O'Reilly Factor, filling in for Bill O'Reilly as needed. He also occasionally appeared as a guest on Hannity & Colmes. Kasich has also authored three books. Courage is Contagious, published in 1998, made the New York Times bestseller list. His second book, Stand for Something: The Battle for America's Soul was published in 2006. His most recent book, Every Other Monday, in which he discusses the strength he has drawn form a Bible discussion group he has been part of for many years, was also a New York Times bestseller. Kasich served on the board of directors for several corporations, including Invacare Corporation and the Chicago-based Norvax Inc. In 2001, Kasich joined Lehman Brothers' investment banking division as a managing director. He remained at Lehman Brothers until it declared bankruptcy in 2008. Lehman Brothers paid him a $182,692 salary and $432,200 bonus in 2008. He stated that the bonus was for work performed in 2007. Republicans tried to recruit Kasich for Governor of Ohio in 2006, but he declined to enter the race.Joe Hallett and Jonathan Riskind, Columbus Dispatch, GOP voices urge Kasich to enter race for governor, 07/15/05 Kasich "always had an independent streak", said his friend, Curt Steiner, former chief of staff to former Republican Ohio Governor and U.S. Senator George Voinovich. "He's a solid Republican, but he's always had his own views. [He's] a biological Democrat" [... his parents were Democrats]. "He came from an average background. He's in touch with people. He's not a Beltway thinker." In early 2007, Kasich was reportedly considering making a serious run for Governor of Ohio in 2010, seeking the Republican nomination to unseat incumbent Ted Strickland.Joe Hallett, Ohio GOP happy as Kasich dips toe in water, Columbus Dispatch, 2/20/2007 In March 2008, he said that Ohio's state income tax should be "phased out". In 2008, Kasich was named the Honorary Chairman of Recharge Ohio, an organization with the stated purpose of electing leaders who would "get our state back on track." He said that he hoped that through Recharge Ohio, he could "provide the framework necessary to allow Ohio to become a leader in economic and educational success." On May 1, 2009, Kasich filed papers to run for Governor of Ohio against incumbent Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. He formally announced his candidacy on June 1, 2009. On January 15, 2010, Kasich announced Ohio State Auditor Mary Taylor as his running mate. During a speech before Ashtabula County Republicans in March 2009, Kasich talked about the need to "break the back of organized labor in the schools," according to the Ashtabula Star Beacon.Points of division: Jobs dominate, but 'hot button' issues remain important in governor's race | Columbus Dispatch Politics Ohio's teachers' unions supported Democrat Ted Strickland, and after Kasich's gubernatorial victory, he said, “I am waiting for the teachers’ unions to take out full-page ads in all the major newspapers, apologizing for what they had to say about me during this campaign." Elsewhere, he said he was willing to work with "unions that make things."Unions that 'make things' will get chance to help | Columbus Dispatch Politics On May 4, 2010, Kasich won the Republican nomination for governor, having run unopposed. On November 2, 2010, Kasich defeated incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland in a closely contested race to win the governorship. He was sworn in at midnight on January 10, 2011, in a private ceremony at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus. It was then followed by a ceremonial inauguration at the Ohio Theatre at noon on the same day.   In November 2014, Kasich won re-election, defeating Democrat Ed FitzGerald, the county executive of Cuyahoga County, 64% to 33%. He won 86 of 88 counties. Kasich, who was elected with Tea Party support in 2010, faced some backlash from some tea party activists. His decision to accept the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid caused some Tea Party activists to refuse to support his campaign.Terkel, Amanda (March 11, 2013).

In June 2013, Kasich signed into law a state budget which included anti-abortion measures such as mandating any woman seeking an abortion to have a trans-abdominal ultrasound, and barring abortion providers from entering into emergency transfer agreements with public hospitals. The bill stripped some $1.4 million in federal dollars from Planned Parenthood by placing the organization last on the priority list for family-planning funds.Ohio Abortion Restrictions: Gov. John Kasich Signs New State Budget Containing Anti-Abortion Measures, The Huffington Post (July 1, 2015). The bill also provided funding to crisis pregnancy centers, which do not provide abortion referrals.

John Kasich signs legislation, Cleveland Plain Dealer (June 13, 2014). Ohio's RPS program was created by 2008 legislation and required the state to acquire 12.5 percent of its energy portfolio from renewable sources and to reduce energy consumption by 22 percent by 2025. The legislation signed by Kasich to stop the program was supported by Republican legislative leaders, utility companies, and some industry groups, and opposed by environmentalists, some manufacturers, and the American Lung Association. In his 2015 budget plan, Kasich proposed raising the tax rate on hydraulic fracturing (fracking) activities.Jeremy Pelzer, Ohio's fracking tax would jump significantly under Gov. John Kasich's budget plan, Cleveland Plain Dealer (February 2, 2015). Specifically, Kasich's plan called for imposing a 6.5 percent severance tax on crude oil and natural gas extracted via horizontal drilling and sold at the source (about $3.25 per $50 barrel of oil), and for an additional 4.5 percent tax per thousand cubic feet on natural gas and liquefied natural gas (about $0.16 per thousand cubic feet). The proposal would not affect conventional drilling taxes. Kasich formerly supported fracking in Ohio state parks and forests, signing legislation in mid-2011 authorizing him to appoint a five-member commission to oversee the leasing of mineral rights on state land to the highest bidders.Eric Albrecht, Kasich reverses on fracking in state parks: Legislators call for investigation into ODNR plan, Columbus Dispatch (February 18, 2014). In 2012, Kasich aides planned a campaign with a stated goal to "marginalize the effectiveness of communications by adversaries about the initiative" to bring fracking to state parks and forests, naming in an email the Ohio Sierra Club and state Representatives Robert F. Hagan and Nickie Antonio as adversaries of the plan. Kasich never appointed the commission, and the promotional plan was never put into effect. A memo and email relating to the 2012 promotional campaign were publicly released for the first time in February 2015, which according to the Columbus Dispatch attracted criticism from state environmental and liberal groups, as well as Democratic state legislators, who called for an investigation. On the same day the governor reversed himself, with a spokesman saying, "At this point, the governor doesn't support fracking in state parks. We reserve the right to revisit that, but it’s not what he wants to do right now, and that's been his position for the past year and a half."

Faced with the need to close a $8 billion state budget deficit, Kasich proposed selling five state prisons to the for-profit prison industry. The Lake Erie prison was sold for $72.7 million to the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), generating savings of $3 million. Kasich's Director of Corrections, Gary Mohr, whom he had hired in January 2011, had previously worked for CCA, but he said that he removed himself from the sales process.

At that time, the most recent execution had occurred in January 2014. According to records obtained by the Columbus Dispatch through a public-records request, Kasich granted 66 of 1,521 requests for executive clemency, about 4.4 percent of the non-death-penalty cases he received and acted upon from 2011 to 2014. This was the lowest clemency rate of any Ohio governor since at least the 1980s, when records began to be kept.

Will, Kasich waits in the wings, Washington Post (March 18, 2015). In 2011, Kasich signed sentencing reform legislation which allowed judges to sentence defendants convicted of non-violent fourth- and fifth-degree felonies to "community-based halfway house facilities" instead of prison; expanded the earned credit system to allow inmates to reduce their sentences; and allowed felons who have already served 80 percent or more of their sentenced to be immediately released.Reginald Fields, Ohio Gov.

When asked whether, if elected president, he would federally enforce marijuana laws in states which have legalized marijuana, Kasich characterized it as a states' rights issue and said that "I'd have to think about it." In March 2014, in an effort to address the opioid epidemic, Kasich signed legislation (passed unanimously in both chambers of the state legislature) expanding the availability of naloxone, a lifesaving antidote to opioid overdoses; the measure allowed friends and family members of addicts to obtain access naloxone and for first responders to carry naloxone.Cory Shaffer, First responders in Ohio can now carry life-saving heroin overdose antidote, Cleveland Plain Dealer (March 12, 2014).

The overall 2015 budget provides a 6.3 percent state income-tax cut as a part one component of a $1.9 billion net tax reduction and lowers the top income-tax rate to slightly below 5 percent. The budget also "spends $955 million more in basic state aid for K-12 schools than the last two-year period"; "boosts state funding for higher education to help offset a two-year tuition freeze at public universities"; expands the Medicaid health program; increases cigarette taxes by 35 cents a pack; and "prohibits independent health care and child care workers under contract with the state from unionizing." On March 31, 2011, in his first year as governor, Kasich signed into law Senate Bill 5, a controversial labor law which restricted collective bargaining rights of public employees, such as police officers, firefighters, and teachers.Robert Higgs, Kasich-O-Meter: Revamp the state's collective bargaining law for public employees, Politifact (March 5, 2013).Ohio's SB 5, Explained, StateImpact/NPR (retrieved September 13, 2015).  The legislation, championed by Kasich,Jim Provance, Kasich accepts defeat of Issue 2, Toledo Blade (November 8, 2015). prohibited all public employees from striking and restricted their ability to negotiate health care and pension benefits. The final version of the legislation signed by Kasich had passed the state Senate in a 17-16 vote (with six Senate Republicans joining all of the Senate Democrats in voting no) and the state House in a 53-44 vote, with two members abstaining.CNN, Bill restricting public-sector unions passes in Ohio (March 30, 2011). Democrats and labor unions opposed the legislation and placed a referendum on the November 2011 ballot to repeal SB 5. SB 5 also "sparked numerous protests with thousands of union workers and other opponents descending on the Statehouse, mirroring similar demonstrations in Wisconsin and injecting Ohio into the national debate over Republican governors' attempts to curb public workers' collective bargaining rights."Joe Guillen, What's really in Senate Bill 5? Clearing up the rumors, misinformation surrounding collective bargaining overhaul, Cleveland Plain Dealer (March 20, 2011). Kasich and other supporters of SB 5 characterized the legislation as a necessary measure "to help public employers control labor costs" and reduce tax burdens to make Ohio more competitive with other states, while labor unions and other opponents characterized the bill as "a union-busting attack on the middle class." Ohio voters rejected Senate Bill 5 in a 61 percent to 39 percent vote, which was viewed as a rebuke to Kasich.Reginald Field, Ohio voters overwhelmingly reject Issue 2, dealing a blow to Gov. John Kasich, Cleveland Plain Dealer (November 10, 2011). On election night, Kasich said in a speech at the Ohio Statehouse that "It's clear the people have spoken. I heard their voices. I understand their decision. And frankly, I respect what the people have to say in an effort like this." Following this defeat, Kasich dropped efforts for a broad-based collective bargaining restrictions, although in 2012 he supported  a bill including "provisions reminiscent of Senate Bill 5" but applying only to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. In May 2015, Kasich rescinded executive orders issued by his predecessor Ted Strickland in 2007 and 2008 that provided the right to home health care contractors and in-home child care contractors to collectively bargain with the state.Michelle Everhart, Gov. John Kasich rescinds orders allowing collective bargaining for care workers, Columbus Dispatch (May 22, 2015). Kasich has campaigned for a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.Janet Hook, Will Kasich's Balanced Budget Tour Lead Him to White House?, Wall Street Journal (January 23, 2015). Kasich created a 501(c)(4) group, Balanced Budget Forever, to promote the cause.James Hohmann, John Kasich's crusade: Behind the potential 2016 candidate's long-shot bid for a balanced budget amendment, Politico (December 14, 2014). Kasich canceled the school-funding formula put into place by his Democratic predecessor, Governor Ted Strickland,Aaron Marshall, Kasich-O-Meter: Scrap Gov. Ted Strickland's evidence-based school funding model, Politifact (June 28, 2012). and proposed new formulas which would increase funding to poor districts and charter schools. During Kasich's tenure as governor, he pushed to expand charter schools, increase the number of school vouchers that use public money to pay for tuition at private schools, implement a "merit pay" scheme for teachers, and evaluate teachers by student standardized test scores in math and reading.Valerie Strauss, What Ohio Gov. John Kasich is doing to public education in his state, Washington Post (July 20, 2015). During Kasich's tenure, funding for traditional public schools declined by about $500 million, while funding for charter schools has increased at least 27 percent.  Kasich supports the Common Core State Standards and has criticized Republicans who turned against it. As calculated by the Howard Fleeter/Education Tax Policy Institute, total school funding under Kasich (including both charter and district schools) has ranged from a low of $7.1 billion in fiscal year 2013 to $7.8 billion in fiscal year 2015, which was higher than its previous peak under Kasich's predecessor, Ted Strickland.What has Gov. John Kasich really done to school funding in Ohio?, Cleveland Plain Dealer (March 24, 2015). Kasich has proposed total school funding of $8.0 billion in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017. Analysts disagree, however, "on whether Kasich's education budgets give increases beyond inflation." In the 2015 state budget, Kasich used his line-item veto power "to cut more than $84 million of funding from public schools."Sarah McHaney, What does John Kasich believe? Where the candidate stands on 10 issues, PBS (July 21, 2015). According to a September 2014 story in the Columbus Dispatch, Kasich favors allowing public school districts "to teach alternatives to evolution&mdash;such as intelligent design&mdash;if local school officials want to, under the philosophy of 'local control.'"Darrel Rowland, Kasich, FitzGerald at odds on hot-button issues, Columbus Dispatch (September 28, 2014). In November 2002, Kasich urged the invasion of Iraq, telling a crowd of students at Ohio State University: "We should go to war with Iraq. It's not likely that (Saddam) Hussein will give up his weapons. If he did he would be disgraced in the Arab world."Eric Bradner, Kasich revises history on Iraq war, CNN (August 16, 2015). In an August 2015, in an interview, Kasich said: "I would never have committed ourselves to Iraq." A Kasich spokesman subsequently said that "Kasich was not revising history" but was instead saying that the Iraq War was a mistake given the facts available now. Kasich has said that the U.S. "should've left a base in Iraq" instead of withdrawing troops in 2011. In 2015, Kasich said that airstrikes were insufficient to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and he would send U.S. ground troops to fight ISIL.Alexandra Jaffe, Kasich: Boots on the ground necessary to defeat ISIS, CNN (February 20, 2015).Shahien Nasiripour, Kasich Wouldn't Cancel Iran Deal, Would Send Troops to Fight ISIS, Huffington Post (July 26, 2015). Kasich opposed the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran, and in September 2015 was one of fourteen Republican governors who sent a letter to President Obama stating "that we intend to ensure that the various state-level sanctions [against Iran] that are now in effect remain in effect," despite a landmark international nuclear agreement with Iran.Deirdre Shesgreen & Ledyard King, Kasich: Ohio to keep sanctions against Iran, Bucyrus Telegraph-Forum (September 9, 2015). Kasich has said that the U.S.'s drone program should be operated by the Department of Defense, and not by the CIA. Kasich has said that he wants to lift budget sequestration for military spending, and "spend more if necessary."Alexandra Jaffe, Kasich: Boost Defense Spending With Reforms, Lose Sequestration, NBC News (August 31, 2015). In November 2015, Kasich argued against Chinese sovereignty of the South China Sea.CBS Staff, Republican debate transcript, November 10, 2015.  Retrieved November 11, 2015. While in the U.S. House of Representatives, Kasich voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage.Jessica Schulberg, The Reaction John Kasich Got for Accepting Gay Marriage Shows How Far the GOP Has Come, Huffington Post (August 7, 2015).  During this period, Kasich supported a ban on same-sex marriage in Ohio and stated that he did not approve of the "gay lifestyle." As governor of Ohio, Kasich signed an executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation for state employees; this was more narrow than the previous executive order signed by his predecessor because it omitted protections for gender identity.Alan Johnson, Kasich alters order on work rights, The Columbus Dispatch (January 22, 2011). In June 2015, following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that there is a fundamental right to same-sex marriage under the Fourteenth Amendment, Kasich said that he was "obviously disappointed"John Kasich: An 'Obviously Disappointed' Record On Equality, Human Rights Campaign (July 21, 2015).Gov. John Kasich responds to gay marriage ruling (video), Dayton Daily News (June 26, 2015). and that he believes in "traditional marriage."Jack Torry, Gov. John Kasich says 'it's time to move on' from same-sex marriage ruling, Columbus Dispatch (June 28, 2015). Kasich said that the ruling was "the law of the land and we'll abide by it" and that it was "time to move on" to other issues. Kasich indicated that he did not support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to overturn the decision. In September 2015, Kasich commented on the highly publicized case of Kim Davis (the Rowan County, Kentucky clerk who refused to comply with a federal court order directing her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples), saying: "Now, I respect the fact that this lady doesn't agree but she's also a government employee, she's not running a church, I wouldn't force this on a church. But in terms of her responsibility I think she has to comply. I don't think —I don't like the fact that she's sitting in a jail, that's absurd as well. But I think she should follow the law."Kate Davidson & Andrew Ackerman, John Kasich Says Kentucky Clerk Should Follow Law on Gay Marriage, Wall Street Journal (September 6, 2015). Kasich opted to accept Medicaid expansion funding provided by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or "Obamacare") in Ohio.Benen, Steve. Ohio's Kasich expands healthcare access through Obamacare, MSNBC (22 October 2013).Eric Bradner, Kasich in interview: Obamacare here to stay, CNN (October 21, 2014).Skinner, Daniel, "Medicaid in Ohio: The Politics of Expansion, Reauthorization, and Reform," Journal of Health Politics, Policy, and Law, October 7, 2015. [ ]). This decision angered many Statehouse Republicans, who wanted Kasich to reject the expansion.Domenico Montanaro, [Ohio Republican Gov. Kasich On Expanding Medicaid: 'It's My Money'], NPR (May 1, 2015). Total spending on Medicaid by the state was almost $2 billion (or 7.6 percent) below estimates for the fiscal year ending in June 2015, according to a report by the administration.  The lower than expected costs were attributed to expanded managed care, shorter nursing home stays and increased in-home care for seniors, capitated reimbursement policies, increased automation to determine eligibility for the program and pay care providers, and an improving economy in the state which allowed some participants to move out of the program.Catherine Candisky, Ohio’s Medicaid costs $2 billion less than estimates, Columbus Dispatch (August 13, 2015). In an October 2014 interview, Kasich said that repeal of the ACA was "not gonna happen" and stated that "The opposition to it was really either political or ideological. I don't think that holds water against real flesh and blood, and real improvements in people's lives." Kasich later said that he was referring solely to the law's Medicaid expansion, and that "my position is that we need to repeal and replace" the rest of the law.Tom LoBianco, Kasich says he's not an Obamacare hypocrite, CNN (May 27, 2015). In 2015, Kasich expressed support for many provisions of the ACA (ensuring coverage for people with preexisting conditions, the use of insurance exchanges, and Medicaid expansion), but opposed mandates.Chrissie Thompson, Kasich-care: Priorities like Obamacare, without mandates, Cincinnati Enquirer (August 16, 2015). In 2010, while running for governor, Kasich expressed support for amending the U.S. Constitution to abolish the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of jus soli (birthright) citizenship for people born in the United States. Kasich also told the Columbus Dispatch at the time that "One thing that I don't want to reward is illegal immigration." In 2014, Kasich acknowledged that his stance on immigration has "evolved" because "maybe [I'm] a little smarter now," stating: "I don't want to see anybody in pain. So I guess when I look at this now, I look at it differently than I did in '10. ... When I look at a group of people who might be hiding, who may be afraid, who may be scared, who have children, I don't want to be in a position of where I make it worse for them." That year, Kasich expressed openness to a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, saying at a Republican Governors Association (RGA) meeting in Florida, "I don't like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line, [but] we may have to do it."Anna Louie Sussman, Kasich Backs Path to Legal Status for Undocumented Immigrants, Wall Street Journal (August 9, 2015). Kasich was the only governor at the RGA conference "to express openly a willingness to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants."Darrel Rowland, Kasich's immigration views 'evolved', Columbus Dispatch (November 21, 2014). In August 2015, while running for president, Kasich called for a path to legal status (but not necessarily citizenship) for undocumented immigrants and for a guest worker program.Kasich supports a path to legal status for those in country illegally; Trump says they 'have to go', Los Angeles Times (August 16, 2015). Kasich also appeared to disavow his earlier stance against birthright citizenship, stating "I don't think we need to go there"; called for completion of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border; and noted that undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as young children may obtain driver's licenses in Ohio. During a campaign stop on October 27, 2015, Kasich responded with “Well, that’s just crazy,” to the notion of building a wall along the United States' southern border and deporting illegal immigrants from the United States-a policy advocated by Donald Trump.[ ] In 2014, Kasich defended his lieutenant governor, Mary Taylor, after Taylor's chief of staff and that chief of staff's administrative assistant resigned following a timesheet probe.Karen Kasler, Kasich Defends Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor after Resignation of Two Staffers, Ideastream (WVIZ/WCRN) (June 16, 2014).Jim Letizia, Kasich Defends Taylor in Timesheet Probe, Ohio Public Radio (June 17, 2014). Kasich said of Taylor's handling of the matter: "Mary did the right thing and I support her." Upon taking office in 2011, Kasich received criticism for appointing an initial all-white cabinet of 22 members.John Kuntz, The race of Gov. John Kasich's all-white Cabinet only matters if he fails to create jobs: Phillip Morris, Cleveland Plain Dealer (January 21, 2011). Responding to criticism for not appointing any black, Hispanic, or Asian Cabinet members, Kasich said: "I don't look at things from the standpoint of any of these sort of metrics that people tend to focus on, race or age, or any of those things. It's not the way I look at things... I want the best possible team I can get." Shortly afterward, on February 2, 2011, Kasich made his first minority appointment to the Cabinet, naming Michael Colbert, a black man, to lead the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.Aaron Marshall, Gov. John Kasich makes first minority appointment to his Cabinet, Cleveland Plain Dealer (February 2, 2011). Throughout his first gubernatorial campaign, Kasich opposed the Ohio Hub high-speed passenger rail project (a proposed 258-mile Cleveland-to-Cincinnati train) and promised to cancel it.Robert Higgs, Kasich successful in halting $400-million, high-speed rail project, Politifact (January 10, 2011). As governor-elect, Kasich lobbied the federal government to use $400 million in federal dollars allocated for high-speed rail for freight rail projects instead.Lisa Lambert, Tensions with states grow over high speed rail, Reuters (November 10, 2010). In a November 2010 letter to Kasich, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood wrote that the federal funding was specifically allocated by the 2009 economic stimulus act for high-speed rail, and could not be used for other purposes. In a December 2010 meeting with President Barack Obama, Kasich again unsuccessfully lobbied to use the grant money for freight rail rather than high-speed rail.Jack Torry & Mark Niquette, Kasich pitches his $400M rail plan to Obama, Dayton Daily News (December 3, 2010). In December 2010, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced that Ohio would lose the $385 million in grant funds allocated for high-speed passenger rail, since Kasich had informed them that he had no intention of ever building high-speed rail projects.Stephen Koff, Feds to Ohio: Your high-speed rail project is officially dead (and New York thanks you), Cleveland Plain Dealer (December 10, 2010). (Almost $15 million had already been spent for preliminary engineering.) The $385 million was instead diverted to other states, such as California, New York, and Florida, which planned high-speed rail using the grant money for its congressionally intended purpose. Outgoing Governor Ted Strickland, who championed the project, expressed disappointment, saying that the loss of funding for the project was "one of the saddest days during my four years as governor" and that "I can't understand the logic of giving up these vital, job-creating resources to California and Florida at a time when so many Ohioans need jobs." Kasich is an opponent of the Cincinnati Streetcar project.Joe Wessels, Cincinnati streetcar state funding nixed by Ohio agency, Reuters (April 12, 2011).Kasich: Can't 'justify' streetcar money, Cincinnati Enquirer (March 11, 2011). In April 2015, Kasich signed a two-year transportation budget bill which allocated $7.06 billion for highway construction and maintenance, $600 million to local governments for road and bridge projects, and an additional million over the last budget for public transportation.Robert Higgs, John Kasich signs transportation budget that targets billions for roadwork, bolsters driver safety (video), Cleveland Plain Dealer (April 1, 2015).

This measure prompted two federal lawsuits.Robert Higgs, New federal lawsuit targets changes in Ohio voting laws, Cleveland Plain Dealer (May 11, 2015). One, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio on behalf of the NAACP and League of Women Voters of Ohio, resulted in a settlement in April 2015, in which the state agreed to provide evening and Sunday hours for early voting in elections in Ohio through 2018.Robert Higgs, ACLU, Secretary of State Jon Husted settle federal lawsuit over access to early voting in Ohio, Cleveland Plain Dealer (April 20, 2015). The second, still-pending lawsuit was brought in May 2015 by Marc Elias, lead campaign lawyer for Hillary for America; that suit alleges that the Ohio measures disproportionately burden black, Latino and young voters.Darrel Rowland, Federal lawsuit filed against Ohio's voting system, Columbus Dispatch (May 11, 2015). In July 2015, Kasich said that it was "pure demagoguery" for Hillary Clinton to "say that there are Republicans who are deliberately trying to keep people from voting."Darrel Rowland, Hillary Clinton draws ire of John Kasich on voting,  Columbus Dispatch (June 6, 2015). In April 2015, Kasich used his line-item veto power to veto a provision added to a highway-budget bill by Republicans in the state legislature that would have required college students who register to vote in Ohio to obtain a state driver's license and vehicle registration, imposing an estimated $75 in motor vehicle costs on out-of-state college students who wanted to vote in the state.Zachary Roth, John Kasich blocks GOP scheme to target student voting, MSNBC (April 2, 2015).Chrissie Thompson, Kasich vetoes GOP's college-voting provision, Cincinnati Enquirer (May 13, 2015).Editorial: Gov. John Kasich's veto of college-voting restriction does the right thing for Ohio, Cleveland Plain Dealer (April 3, 2015). The veto was celebrated by voting rights advocates, Ohio Democrats, and the Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board, which viewed the proposal as effectively a "poll tax" motivated by a partisan desire to limit college-town voting. Kasich has made only one appointment to the Ohio Supreme Court, because it is an elective office except that the governor can fill unexpired terms.  In May 2012, Ohio Supreme Court Associate Justice Evelyn Lundberg Stratton announced she would retire at the end of 2012..  In December 2012, Kasich appointed Judge Judith L. French to Stratton's unexpired term, which ran from January 1, 2013 through January 1, 2015.   In April 2015, he had announced the formation of his "New Day For America" group. Formerly a 527 group, it filed as a super PAC in July 2015.Daniel Strauss, John Kasich super PAC raises more than $11 million, Politico (July 31, 2015). Between April 20 and June 30, 2015, the super PAC raised over $11.1 million from 165 "reportable contributions," including 34 contributions of $100,000 or more. Major contributors to the PAC include Floyd Kvamme, who donated $100,000, Philip Geier Jr., who donated $500,000, and Jim Dicke, chairman emeritus of Crown Equipment Corporation, who donated $250,000. In May 2015, sources close to him had said he was "virtually certain" to run for the Republican nomination for President, and on July 21, 2015, Kasich announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination during a speech at the Ohio Union, the student union of his alma mater, the Ohio State University. On January 30, 2016, the New York Times endorsed his Primary campaign stating that "Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race", describing their staunch dissatisfaction with front-runners Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz. Kasich was raised a Catholic, but considers denominations irrelevant, and stated that "there's always going to be a part of me that considers myself a Catholic." He drifted away from his religion as an adult, but came to embrace an Anglican faith after both his parents were killed in a car crash by a drunk driver.Cathy Lynn Grossman, 5 faith facts about Gov. John Kasich: 'God is with me wherever I happen to be', Religion News Service (July 21, 2015). Kasich has said he "doesn't find God in church" but does belong to the St. Augustine church in Westerville, Ohio, which is part of the Anglican Church in North America, a conservative church that broke off from the Episcopal Church. Kasich was married to Mary Lee Griffith from 1975 to 1980; they had no children. Griffith has campaigned for Kasich post-divorce. Kasich married his second wife, Karen Waldbillig, a former public relations executive, in March 1997. They have twin daughters, Emma and Reese.
