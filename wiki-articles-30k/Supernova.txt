   A supernova is a rare astronomical event that occurs during the last stellar evolutionary stages of a massive star's life, whose dramatic and catastrophic destruction is marked by one final titanic explosion. For a short time, this causes the sudden appearance of a 'new' bright star, before slowly fading from sight over several weeks or months. Only three Milky Way naked-eye supernova events have been observed during the last thousand years, though many have been telescopically seen in other galaxies. The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Star of 1604 (SN 1604), but remnants of two more recent supernovae have been found retrospectively.  Statistical observations of supernova in extragalactic galaxies suggest they should occur on average about three times every century in the Milky Way, and that any galactic supernova would almost certainly be observable in modern astronomical equipment.  Supernovae are more energetic than novae. In Latin, Nova means "new", referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star. Adding the prefix "super-" distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous. The word supernova was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931. It is pronounced  with the plural supernovae  or supernovas (abbreviated SN, plural SNe after "supernovae"). During maximum brightness, the total equivalent radiant energies produced by supernovae may briefly outshine an entire output of a typical galaxy and emit energies equal to that created over the lifetime of any solar-like star.  Such extreme catastrophes may also expel much, if not all, of its stellar  material away from the star, at velocities up to  or 10% of the speed of light. This drives an expanding and fast-moving shock wave  into the surrounding interstellar medium, and in turn, sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust, which is observed as a supernova remnant. Supernovae create, fuse and eject the bulk of the chemical elements produced by nucleosynthesis.Timmes F.X., Woosley S.E. & Weaver T.A. "Galactic Chemical Evolution" Astrophys. J. Suppl. 98, 617 (1995); D.D. Clayton, Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos: Cambridge University Press (2003) Supernovae play a significant role in enriching the interstellar medium with higher mass elements.  Furthermore, the expanding shock waves from supernova explosions can trigger the formation of new stars.  A great proportion of primary cosmic rays comes from supernovae,  and they are also potentially strong galactic sources of gravitational waves.  Theoretical studies of many supernovae show they can be triggered by one of two basic mechanisms. This can be by sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star; or by the sudden gravitational collapse of the massive star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature to then trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, the core of a massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy that can create a supernova explosion. Observations do show there are more uniqueness or complexities to these two simple alternatives mechanisms, but the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been accepted and established by most astronomers for some time. Due to the significant number of diverse astrophysical consequences of these supernovae events, astronomers now deem supernovae studies, across both stellar and galactic evolution, as most important among their many lines of study.   The earliest recorded supernova, SN 185, was viewed by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD, with the brightest recorded supernova being SN 1006, which was described in detail by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.  The widely observed supernova SN 1054 produced the Crab Nebula. Supernovae SN 1572 and SN 1604, the latest to be observed with the naked eye in the Milky Way galaxy, had notable effects on the development of astronomy in Europe because they were used to argue against the Aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the Moon and planets was immutable.  Johannes Kepler began observing SN 1604 at its peak on October 17, 1604, and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later.  It was the second supernova to be observed in a generation (after SN 1572 seen by Tycho Brahe in Cassiopeia).  Before the development of the telescope, there have only been five supernovae seen in the last millennium. In the perspective of how long a star's lifetime is, its death is very brief. In fact, a star's death may only last a few months. Due to this, a typical human will only experience this rarity, on average, once in their lifetime. This is a microscopic fraction in comparison to the 100 billion stars that compose a galaxy. Since the development of the telescope, the field of supernova discovery has extended to other galaxies, starting with the 1885 observation of supernova S Andromedae in the Andromeda galaxy. American astronomers Rudolph Minkowski and Fritz Zwicky developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning in 1941.  In the 1960s, astronomers found that the maximum intensities of supernova explosions could be used as standard candles, hence indicators of astronomical distances.  Some of the most distant supernovae recently observed appeared dimmer than expected. This supports the view that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.  Techniques were developed for reconstructing supernova explosions that have no written records of being observed. The date of the Cassiopeia A supernova event was determined from light echoes off nebulae,  while the age of supernova remnant RX J0852.0-4622 was estimated from temperature measurements  and the gamma ray emissions from the decay of titanium-44.  In 2009, nitrates were discovered in Antarctic ice deposits that matched the times of past supernova events.  The brightest observed supernova, ASASSN-15lh, was detected in June 2015. With a brightness of 570 billion Suns, ASASSN-15lh's peak luminosity was twice that of the previous record holder.<nowiki/><ref>{{Cite web |last= Cowen |first= Ron |date= 14 January 2016 |title = Brightest-ever supernova still baffles astronomers |url= http://www.nature.com/news/brightest-ever-supernova-still-baffles-astronomers-1.19176 |website= nature.com |accessdate= 15 January 2016 }}</ref>  ==Discovery== {{main|History of supernova observation#Telescope observation}} [[File:NASA-SNR0519690-ChandraXRayObservatory-20150122.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Supernova remnant|remnant]] of a star gone supernova.]]  Early work on what was originally believed to be simply a new category of [[nova]]e was performed during the 1930s by [[Walter Baade]] and [[Fritz Zwicky]] at Mount Wilson Observatory.<ref name="Baade1934"> {{cite journal  |last1=Baade |first1=Walter  |last2=Zwicky |first2=Fritz  |date=1934  |title=On Super-novae  |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]  |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=254–259  |bibcode=1934PNAS...20..254B  |doi=10.1073/pnas.20.5.254  |pmc=1076395  |pmid=16587881 }}</ref> The name ''super-novae'' was first used during 1931 lectures held at [[Caltech]] by Baade and Zwicky, then used publicly in 1933 at a meeting of the [[American Physical Society]].<ref name="baas33_1330"> {{cite journal  |last1=Osterbrock |first1=Donald E.  |year=2001  |title=Who Really Coined the Word Supernova?

Type I supernovae without this strong line are classified as types Ib and Ic, with type Ib showing strong neutral helium lines and type Ic lacking them.  The light curves are all similar, although type Ia are generally brighter at peak luminosity, but the light curve is not important for classification of type I supernovae.  A small number of type Ia supernovae exhibit unusual features such as non-standard luminosity or broadened light curves, and these are typically classified by referring to the earliest example showing similar features.  For example, the sub-luminous [[SN 2008ha]] is often referred to as [[SN 2002cx]]-like or class Ia-2002cx.  ===Type II=== [[Image:SNIIcurva.svg|thumb|Light curves are used to classify type II-P and type II-L supernovae]] The supernovae of Type&nbsp;II can also be sub-divided based on their spectra. While most Type&nbsp;II supernovae show very broad [[emission line]]s which indicate expansion velocities of many thousands of [[kilometres per second]], some, such as [[SN 2005gl]], have relatively narrow features in their spectra. These are called Type&nbsp;IIn, where the 'n' stands for 'narrow'.  A few supernovae, such as [[SN 1987K]] and [[SN 1993J]], appear to change types: they show lines of hydrogen at early times, but, over a period of weeks to months, become dominated by lines of helium. The term [[Type IIb supernova|"Type IIb"]] is used to describe the combination of features normally associated with Types&nbsp;II and Ib.<ref name="taxonomy" />  Type II supernovae with normal spectra dominated by broad hydrogen lines that remain for the life of the decline are classified on the basis of their light curves.  The most common type shows a distinctive "plateau" in the light curve shortly after peak brightness where the visual luminosity stays relatively constant for several months before the decline resumes.

The rate of mass loss for luminous stars depends on the metallicity and luminosity.  Extremely luminous stars at near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen before they reach core collapse and so will not form a type&nbsp;II supernova.  At low metallicity, all stars will reach core collapse with a hydrogen envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova.  Stars with an initial mass up to about 90 times the sun, or a little less at high metallicity, are expected to result in a type II-P supernova which is the most commonly observed type.  At moderate to high metallicity, stars near the upper end of that mass range will have lost most of their hydrogen when core collapse occurs and the result will be a type&nbsp;II-L supernova.  At very low metallicity, stars of around {{Solar mass|140–250}} will reach core collapse by pair instability while they still have a hydrogen atmosphere and an oxygen core and the result will be a supernova with type&nbsp;II characteristics but a very large mass of ejected <sup>56</sup>Ni and high luminosity.  ====Type Ib and Ic==== {{Main|Type Ib and Ic supernovae}} [[Image:Supernova 2008D.jpg|thumb|SN 2008D, a Type Ib<ref> {{cite journal  |last1=Malesani |first1=D.  |last2=Fynbo |first2=J.

These events are difficult to detect, but large surveys have detected possible candidates.<ref name=failed>{{cite journal|last1=Reynolds|first1=Thomas M.|last2=Fraser|first2=Morgan|last3=Gilmore|first3=Gerard|title=Gone without a bang: an archivalHSTsurvey for disappearing massive stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=453|issue=3|year=2015|pages=2886–2901|issn=0035-8711|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv1809|arxiv = 1507.05823 |bibcode = 2015MNRAS.453.2885R }}</ref><ref name=gerke>{{cite journal |last1=Gerke |first1=J.

Although the energy that disrupts each type of supernovae is delivered promptly, the light curves are mostly dominated by subsequent radioactive heating of the rapidly expanding ejecta. Some have considered rotational energy from the central pulsar. The ejecta gases would dim quickly without some energy input to keep it hot. The intensely radioactive nature of the ejecta gases, which is now known to be correct for most supernovae, was first calculated on sound nucleosynthesis grounds in the late 1960s, primary by [[Donald D. Clayton]] and his coworkers.<ref>["Nucleosynthesis During Silicon Burning", D. Bodansky. D.D, Clayton & W.A. Fowler, Phys. Rev.

Share 1988"/> confirmed earlier predictions that those two radioactive nuclei were the power sources.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  The visual light curves of the different supernova types all depend at late times on radioactive heating, but they vary in shape and amplitude on the underlying mechanisms of the explosion, the way that visible radiation is produced, the epoch of its observation, and the transparency of the ejected material.  The light curves can be significantly different at other wavelengths.  For example, at ultraviolet wavelengths there is an early extremely luminous peak lasting only a few hours corresponding to the  breakout of the shock launched by the initial explosion, but that breakout is hardly detectable optically.  The light curves for type&nbsp;Ia are mostly very uniform, with a consistent maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity.  Their optical energy output is driven by radioactive decay of nickel-56 (half life 6 days), which then decays to radioactive cobalt-56 (half life 77 days). These radioisotopes from material ejected in the explosion excite surrounding material to incandescence. Studies of cosmology today rely on <sup>56</sup>[[nickel|Ni]] radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of Type Ia, which are the "standard candles" of cosmology but whose diagnostic 847keV and 1238keV gamma rays were first detected only in 2014,<ref>“Cobalt-56 γ-ray emission lines from the type Ia supernova 2014J”, E. Churazov, R. Sunyaev et al., Nature 512, 406–408 (2014)</ref> 47 years after the prediction<ref>D.D. Clayton et al.,Astrophys. J. 155,  75 (1969)</ref> of their emission by supernovae. The initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted.  The light curve continues to decline in the B band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days, but this is only a hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it. The visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half life and controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation.  After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate again as [[positron emission]] becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt-56, although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied.  Type&nbsp;Ib and Ic light curves are basically similar to type&nbsp;Ia although with a lower average peak luminosity.  The visual light output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation, but there is a much lower mass of nickel-56 produced in these types of explosion.  The peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type Ib/c supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm.  The most luminous type Ic supernovae are referred to as [[hypernova]]e and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity.  The source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole, which also produce [[gamma-ray burst]]s.  The light curves for type&nbsp;II supernovae are characterised by a much slower decline than type&nbsp;I, on the order of 0.05&nbsp;[[absolute magnitude|magnitudes]] per day,<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1979A&A....72..287B |title=Photometric properties of type II supernovae |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=72 |pages=287 |last1=Barbon |first1=Roberto |last2=Ciatti |first2=Franco |last3=Rosino |first3=Leonida |year=1979 }}</ref> excluding the plateau phase. The visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months, due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star.  In the initial explosion this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised.  The majority of type&nbsp;II supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines, emitting visible light and becoming more transparent.  This is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in type&nbsp;I supernovae, due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen.<ref name="doggett" />  In type&nbsp;II-L the plateau is absent because the progenitor had relatively little hydrogen left in its atmosphere, sufficient to appear in the spectrum but insufficient to produce a noticeable plateau in the light output.  In type&nbsp;IIb supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere of the progenitor is so depleted (thought to be due to tidal stripping by a companion star) that the light curve is closer to a type&nbsp;I supernova and the hydrogen even disappears from the spectrum after several weeks.<ref name="doggett" />  Type&nbsp;IIn supernovae are characterised by additional narrow spectral lines produced in a dense shell of circumstellar material.  Their light curves are generally very broad and extended, occasionally also extremely luminous and referred to as a [[hypernova]].  These light curves are produced by the highly efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejecta into electromagnetic radiation by interaction with the dense shell of material.  This only occurs when the material is sufficiently dense and compact, indicating that it has been produced by the progenitor star itself only shortly before the supernova occurs.  Large numbers of supernovae have been catalogued and classified to provide distance candles and test models.  Average characteristics vary somewhat with distance and type of host galaxy, but can broadly be specified for each supernova type. {| class="wikitable" style="max-width: 600px" |+Physical properties of supernovae by type<ref name="weidong">{{Cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = W. | last2 = Leaman | first2 = J. | last3 = Chornock | first3 = R. | last4 = Filippenko | first4 = A.

Particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae, the emitted electromagnetic radiation is a tiny fraction of the total event energy.  There is a fundamental difference between the balance of energy production in the different types of supernova.  In type Ia white dwarf detonations, most of the explosion energy is directed into [[nucleosynthesis|heavy element synthesis]] and [[kinetic energy]] of the ejecta.  In core collapse supernovae, the vast majority of the energy is directed into [[neutrino]] emission, and while some of this apparently powers the main explosion 99%+ of the neutrinos escape in the first few minutes following the start of the collapse.  Type Ia supernovae derive their energy from runaway nuclear fusion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.  Details of the energetics are still not fully modelled, but the end result is the ejection of the entire mass of the original star with high kinetic energy.  Around half a solar mass of this is [[nickel-56|Ni<sub>56</sub>]] generated from silicon burning.  Ni<sub>56</sub> is [[radioactive]] and generates [[cobalt-56|Co<sub>56</sub>]] by [[beta plus decay]] with a [[half life]] of six days, plus gamma rays.  Co<sub>56</sub> itself decays by the beta plus path with a half life of 77 days to stable Fe<sub>56</sub>.  These two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation from type Ia supernovae.  In combination with the changing transparency of the ejected material, they produce the rapidly declining light curve.<ref name="mazzali"/>  Core collapse supernovae are on average visually fainter than type Ia supernovae, but the total energy released is far higher. This is driven by gravitational potential energy from the core collapse, initially producing [[electron neutrino]]s from disintegrating nucleons, followed by all [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavours]] of thermal neutrinos from the super-heated neutron star core.  Around 1% of these neutrinos are thought to deposit sufficient energy into the outer layers of the star to drive the resulting explosion, but again the details cannot be reproduced exactly in current models.  Kinetic energies and nickel yields are somewhat lower than type Ia supernovae, hence the reduced visual luminosity, but energy from the [[ionisation]] of the many solar masses of remaining hydrogen can contribute to a much slower decline in luminosity and produce the plateau phase seen in the majority of core collapse supernovae.  {| class="wikitable" |+Energetics of supernovae !Supernova !!Approximate total energy<br>([[Foe (unit)|foe]]){{ref|c|c}} !!Ejected Ni<br>(solar masses) !!Neutrino energy<br>(foe) !!Kinetic energy<br>(foe) !!Electromagnetic radiation<br>(foe) |- |Type&nbsp;Ia<ref name="mazzali">{{Cite journal | last1 = Mazzali | first1 = P.

This is one scenario for producing high luminosity supernovae and is thought to be the cause of type Ic [[hypernova]]e and long duration [[gamma-ray burst]]s.  If the relativistic jets are too brief and fail to penetrate the stellar envelope then a low luminosity gamma-ray burst may be produced and the supernova may be sub-luminous.  When a supernova occurs inside a small dense cloud of circumstellar material then it will produce a shock wave that can efficiently convert a high fraction of the kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation.  Even though the initial explosion energy was entirely normal the resulting supernova will have high luminosity and extended duration since it does not rely on exponential radioactive decay.  This type of event may cause type IIn hypernovae.  Although pair-instability supernovae are core collapse supernovae with spectra and light curves similar to type II-P, the nature of the explosion following core collapse is more like a giant type Ia with runaway fusion of carbon, oxygen, and silicon.  The total energy released by the highest mass events is comparable to other core collapse supernovae but neutrino production is thought to be very low, hence the kinetic and electromagnetic energy is very high.  The cores of these stars are much larger than any white dwarf and the amount of radioactive nickel and other heavy elements ejected can be orders of magnitude higher, with consequently high visual luminosity.  ===Progenitor=== The supernova classification type is closely tied to the type of star at the time of the explosion.  The occurrence of each type of supernova depends dramatically on the metallicity and hence the age of the host galaxy.  Type Ia supernovae are produced from [[white dwarf]] stars in [[binary star|binary]] systems and occur in all [[Galaxy morphological classification|galaxy types]].  Core collapse supernovae are only found in galaxies undergoing current or very recent star formation, since they result from short-lived massive stars.  They are most commonly found in type Sc [[spiral galaxy|spirals]], but also in the arms of other spiral galaxies and in [[irregular galaxy|irregular galaxies]], especially [[Starburst galaxy|starburst galaxies]].  Type Ib/c and II-L, and possibly most type IIn, supernovae are only thought to be produced from stars having near-solar metallicity levels that result in high mass loss from massive stars, hence they are less common in older more distant galaxies.  The table shows the expected progenitor for the main types of core collapse supernova, and the approximate proportions of each in the local neighbourhood. {| class="wikitable" |+ Fraction of core collapse supernovae types by progenitor<ref name=eldridge/> |- !

Red supergiants are the expected progenitors for the vast majority of core collapse supernovae, and these have been observed but only at relatively low masses and luminosities, below about {{solar mass|18}} and {{solar luminosity|100,000}} respectively.  Most progenitors of type II supernovae are not detected and must be considerably fainter, and presumably less massive.  It is now proposed that higher mass red supergiants do not explode as supernovae, but instead evolve back towards hotter temperatures.  Several progenitors of type IIb supernovae have been confirmed, and these were K and G supergiants, plus one A supergiant.<ref name=smartt/>  Yellow hypergiants or LBVs are proposed progenitors for type IIb supernovae, and almost all type IIb supernovae near enough to observe have shown such progenitors.<ref name=problem>{{Cite journal | last1 = Walmswell | first1 = J.
