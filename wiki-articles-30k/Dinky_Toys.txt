    Dinky Toys are die-cast zamac miniature vehicles which were produced by Meccano Ltd – makers of Hornby Trains, which were named after founder Frank Hornby. Dinky Toys in England were made from 1935 to 1979. The factory was at Binns Road, Liverpool, England. Arguably, Dinky Toys, perhaps along with Solido, were the most notable diecast vehicles ever produced - predating dozens of other diecast marques including Corgi, Matchbox, and even Mattel's Hot Wheels. Frank Hornby established Meccano Ltd. in 1901 to make metal erector construction sets (Wainwright 2015). The company soon moved into trains with the first O gauge clockwork train appearing in 1920 (Ellis 2009, p.&nbsp;15; Wainwright 2013). In the early 1930s, Meccano had made many types of tin plate and other metal cars, like its Morgan and BSA three-wheelers, mostly in kit form (Interesting 1934, pp.&nbsp;306–307). In 1933 Meccano Ltd issued a series of railway and trackside accessories to complement their O scale (1/45) Hornby Trains model train sets (Force 1988, p.&nbsp;6; Ramsay 1933, p.&nbsp;88). These accessories were first called "Hornby Modelled Miniatures", but in the April 1934 issue of Meccano Magazine they were given the name 'Meccano Dinky Toys' for the first time (Meccano Magazine 1934 p.&nbsp;332) in August 1935, the name Meccano was dropped and the marque became DINKY TOYS until 1971(Encyclopédie Dinky Toys). By December 1934 the Dinky name was also used for the 'Dinky Builder' sets where colored flat metal pieces could be hinged together to make buildings and vehicles (Esplen 2013). One story is that the famous 'Dinky' name came from a nickname that a friend gave to one of Frank Hornby's daughters. The word could have been derived from the Scottish "dink" meaning neat or fine (Powerhouse Museum (Simpson 2008), but the Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the meaning of Dinky simply as "overly or unattractively small" (Merriam-Webster 2014), so a grand intra-family explanation for such a basic diminutive term seems unlikely. The name could have simply been 'borrowed' by Hornby from the original Dinky toys designed and made by Dion Clayton Calthrop and Gilbert A Pownall prior to 1915 which included model houses, churches, bridges, mills, villagers, etc.(Daily Mail article 26 Nov 1915)  At this time, six vehicles were introduced (designated 22a through f), including a sports car, a sports coupe, a truck, a delivery van, a farm tractor, and a tank, they were all cast in lead. Soon after the first Dinky model car available individually was numbered 23 – a sports car based on the MG Magic Midget. At this early time a series 24 (a-h) were introduced and included a generic ambulance (which was made until the late 1940s) a grand sport open four-seater, a grand sport two-seater, a coupe and a limousine (Gardner and O'Neill 1996, pp.&nbsp;46–47). The 24 series was also made in France. Some smaller vehicles were also produced alongside model track workers, passengers, station staff and other O scale track side accessories (Meccano Dinky 1934 p.&nbsp;332). All of these early cars were inaccurate representations and had die-cast metal bodies, chassis and wheels with rubber tyres. By August 1935 there were around 200 different products in the Dinky Toys range which included die-cast ships, aeroplanes and small trains. Dinky Toys model cars were available individually in trade packs of 6 cars per pack. Most models would not be available in individual boxes until 1952. The number of commercial vehicles expanded with the addition of Series 28 which included many delivery vans. In 1935, a new series 30 was introduced which featured accurate likenesses of specific vehicles for the first time. These included a generic ambulance, a Daimler saloon, a Vauxhall saloon, a Chrysler Airflow saloon, and a Rolls-Royce saloon (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, pp.&nbsp;46–47). Smaller Matchbox-sized Austin 7 saloons and tourers were also made. About this same time, several models were also made and marketed in France. Liveries of well known companies began to decorate the commercial vehicles. Series 30 included: In 1938, a new Series 36 was introduced. Most of these models were also made after World War II up to 1948. Production was halted during the war while the Binns Road factory in Liverpool produced many items for the War effort. Models in series 36, meanwhile, included a Rover Saloon, a Bentley 2 seat sports coupe, an Armstrong-Siddeley limousine, a British Salmson 4 seater convertible, a British Salmson 2 seat convertible, and a Humber Vogue coupe (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, pp.&nbsp;48–49). Chassis were cast with open holes in them, saving expense and metal. Provisions were made in some models for attachment of metal drivers, but not many appeared before the war, making them more valuable (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p.&nbsp;48). Dinkys had acute problems on early models with zinc pest also known wrongly as metal fatigue, caused by impure alloys in which corossion happens between molecules causing cracking of the metal (Harvey 1974, p.&nbsp;1997). Metal would then crumble prematurely. This was much more common before the war in the years 1938 - 1941, and a main reason it is rare to find surviving toys in good condition from this period (Ramsay 1993, p.&nbsp;88). Some early castings have survived in numbers, while others are rare without some form of damage - such as the 28/2 Series vans. Another theory is that lead from Hornby train and Dinky Toys production, lead ties from sacks and foil from cigarettes wraping found their way into the metal, corrupting it. Between 1937 and 1939, a number of military vehicles numbered from 151 to 162 were introduced. These were painted army green and consisted of a medium and a light tank, an Austin 7 military car, a six-wheeled truck, a reconnaissance car, a searchlight lorry, an anti aircraft gun, a light Dragon tractor with limber and 19 pdr gun. Most interesting were several fairly detailed trailers, including: amler, cooker trailer and water tank trailer. These models were produced through 1941 though a few - the clever 161b Anti-Aircraft Gun and some of the trailers - were also made again in 1946–1955 immediately after the war (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). It is not difficult to tell if the model is pre-war or post as pre-war models were fitted with thin dia 1.626&nbsp;mm. (0.064 in.) axles and the post war axles were 2.032&nbsp;mm. (0.08 in.). The pre-war hubs were smooth and after the war, there was a raised part in the center of the hub. Tracks on the tanks and the 162a Light Dragon Artillery Tractor were done with wire-link sprocket chain wrapped around the hubs. This gave a mechanical, but not very realistic, appearance to the tracks. With the Anti-Aircraft Gun, the side panels folded and not only did the gun swivel 360 degrees, but it could be moved from level to about a 50-degree angle upward. The searchlight was also adjustable in horizontal and vertical directions. Military models, however, were made up through the end of production in the late 1970s. A wide variety of military vehicles were produced, like the Jeep-like Austin Champ with driver and passengers. In the early days of the Dinky Toys range aeroplanes and ships formed a considerable part of the output of the Binns Road factory alongside models of cars, vans and trucks. Both civilian and military aircraft were subjects for the Dinky Toys modellers, and the model of the Spitfire was also sold in a special presentation box between 1939 and 1941 as part of The Spitfire Fund in order to raise money for the supply of a real Spitfire to the Royal Air Force. Some models were clearly identified whereas others re-issued in 1945 had generic names such as Heavy Bomber (66a) and Two Seater Fighter (66c). The reason for this is not clear and it may have been that these were not true representations of particular aircraft types, but there were rumours that some models of aircraft and ships were disguised so that enemy agents would not be able to recognise allied aircraft and shipping from the Dinky Toys models. This was of particular importance in the production of French Dinky models due to the political friction in Europe before the war and the fact that France was occupied by the Axis forces during hostilities. These theories do not stand as the models with generic names were issued in 1945 and at that time there was no enemy any more, the allies had dealt with them. (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). Production of model aircraft resumed after the war with a mixture re-issues of pre-war and new models of civilian airliners and new jet-powered aircraft. Production of Dinky planes tailed off in 1968 but was resurgent in 1971 with a range of World War II types complete with battery-powered propellers, modern jet fighters, and even a Sea King helicopter. These large scale planes had been developed by Airfix but were made by Meccano Ltd. which had just been bought by Airfix. These are some examples of the sizeable range:    Although the production of aircraft models continued after the war, the heyday of Dinky ships was between 1934 and 1939. The models were cast from the same unstable alloy that was used across the entire immediate pre-war Dinky range and have therefore also suffered from metal fatigue that makes survivors all the more rare. Small metal rollers were also included in the design and concealed in the underside of the hull so that the models could be moved smoothly across surfaces. Mirroring the aircraft range, both civilian and military ships were issued, and again, some were disguised. It was not until 1976 that five further models were added to the long line of maritime releases from Dinky Toys, these were in the larger scale of 1/180 - 1/200. The liner France was the only Dinky Toys ship made in France after the war, it was made partly of zamac and partly of plastic at the scale of 1/1200. (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). Models in the pre-war range include: No Dinky Toys models were made between 1941 and 1945. The French Meccano factory was occupied by the Germans some who worked for Märklin and the British factory was on war work but every Christmas a few models would be sold from pre-war stocks. Thus during and after the war a few 'pre-war' models survived and were sold in 1945 (Harvey 1974, p.&nbsp;1997-1998) (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). The first new models released after the war were U.S. military jeeps ref.153a in April 1946 in England and ref. 24M in France, it was the first Dinky Toy made at the scale of 1/43.   Besides some of the military vehicles offered before and after the war, the first significant releases from Dinky in the late 1940s were the 40 series, which were all British saloons. These were the opening chapter of the "golden age" of Dinky Toys in the post-war era and represented far greater accuracy and detail than their pre-war relatives. These were very popular and today are often considered by collectors to be the quintessential Dinky Toys models. The 40 series cars were manufactured from better quality alloy, meaning that the survival rate is higher and although originally sold in trade boxes of six, they were renumbered in 1954 and re-coloured in two-tone paintwork in 1956, the Austin Somerset ref. 40j is probably the first model sold in its own individual yellow box. The first two models in the 40 series were in 1:48 scale, while the others were in 1:45 scale (Schellekens 2010). The Jowett Javelin saloon is an interesting case as plans were made, but the model was never issued. More recently, Odgi Models have remade the Jowett and a couple other Dinky Toys Models which were planned but never manufactured. The series included : As part of the post-war development and expansion of the range, in 1947 Meccano Ltd introduced a series of model lorries modelled to the usual Dinky scale of 1:48, and called the range Dinky Supertoys. To many collectors these are the most desirable Dinky Toys, and big premiums are paid for rare issues and difficult to find casting / wheel variations. This name was used until 1965 when it disappeared (Encyclopédie Dunky Toys). In 1968, Meccano registered the trademark Super Dinky®, this marque was used for Bobigny and Calais products only (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). Some models  issued in this line included:  In 1950 Meccano introduced as Dinky Supertoys a number of appealing Guy Vans finished in period liveries. Each model was an identical all metal box van with opening rear doors. The Guy cab was joined by a Bedford S cab in 1955 and a Guy Warrior cab was introduced in 1960. Supertoys were commonly packaged in white boxes with thin blue horizontal lines and were marketed all on their own - no longer were the models solely focused on railroad accessories. Still, they were not quite reached the commercial marketing level of later diecast brands like Corgi Toys or Solido. Meccano continued producing beautifully detailed Dinky Supertoys commercial vehicles through the fifties and sixties, including such diverse subjects as a Mobile Television Control Room and Camera Van in both BBC and ABC Television liveries, a Leyland test chassis with removable miniature 5 ton weights, a series of military vehicles including a Corporal Erecting Vehicle and missile (a subject also modelled by Corgi Toys at the same time), a range of Thornycroft Mighty Antar heavy haulage transporters complete with loads and a Horse Box in British Railways and later in Newmarket liveries. Having been well known before the war, Dinky Toys were popular in the United Kingdom in the early 1950s. The smaller cars were in a scale of 1:45, while the larger cars and many Supertoys, as stated above, were in a scale of 1:48, which blended in with O scale railway sets, but many buses and lorries were scaled down further (Schellekens 2010). The scale of the Dinky Toys land vehicles range from 1/27 for the Lunar Roving Vehicle ref. 355 and 1/99 for the Duple Viceroy Luxury coach ref. 293 / 296. Because of the introduction of data processing, the British Dinky Toys range was reorganized in 1954 with a new numbering system – previously model numbers were commonly followed by letters and often sold in sets with several vehicles. Now each model had its own unique three digit catalogue number, and cars were now sold in individual boxes. The renumbering also happened in France, but in 1959 (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). The Dinky Toys ranges became more sophisticated throughout the 1950s. Some cars in the sporty pre-war line were carried on after the war like the Alvis sports tourer, the Sunbeam Talbot, or the Frazer-Nash BMW. These offerings then led to a magnificent line-up in the post war DT range, which included a Lagonda, an Armstrong-Siddeley, MG, Sunbeam Alpine, Austin Atlantic, Austin Healey 100, Aston Martin DB3S racer, and Triumph TR2 (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, pp.&nbsp;50–51). Additionally, several models introduced were American cars, and even now still seem unique choices, such as a 1954 Packard convertible, a 1955 Plymouth Belvedere, a Cunningham, the 1953 and 1957 Studebakers (and a 1957 Packard), a Chrysler New Yorker Convertible, a 1957 Rambler, and a late model Hudson Hornet. In many cases, even domestic British / European vehicle choices for models were just as interesting as those from Corgi Toys, e. g. a Connaught racing car, a Maserati Sports 2000, the AC Aceca, a Humber Hawk, and a Daimler instead of the more routine Jaguar. Several colorful gift sets of sports and racing cars were offered in the mid-1950s, usually five cars to a set. For example, Gift set no. 4 / 249 offered Cooper-Bristol in British racing green, Alfa Romeo in the Italian red, Ferrari in the blue and yellow of Argentina, Fangios country, H.W.M. in H.W.M. light green, and Maserati in the red and white colours of Switzerland. No. 149, the sports car set offered an MG, Austin-Healey, Sunbeam Alpine, Aston-Martin and Triumph TR-2 (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, pp.&nbsp;22–23) (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). Production of agricultural machinery and implements had occurred since the 1930s, such as the 1933 number 22e Fordson farm tractor, and such offerings were maintained post-war. One interesting model was the odd Opperman 3-wheeled Motocart, a tilting flat-bed vehicle with engine hanging off to the side of its large front wheel (Rixon 2005, pp.&nbsp;122–123). In November 1958, Meccano Ltd introduced the Dublo Dinky range of models in 1:76 OO scale, designed to be used with the Hornby railway system (Force 1988, pp.&nbsp;165–166). These were relatively cheap to produce – having a one-piece die-cast metal body, a base plate and or windows on some and plastic wheels. There was the added bonus of being able to compete in the small-scale toy car market which, at the time was dominated by Lesney's Matchbox (see Force 1988, p.&nbsp;47). There were a total 15 Dublo models, although with upgrades and modifications there are possibly up to 42 variations (not including box variations) manufactured (Force 1988, p.&nbsp;47). All models came boxed. There were no colour changes throughout the short life of Dublo.   Models were well-proportioned and looked similar in style to contemporary Matchbox or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to Matchbox, the Land Rover (which came with a horse trailer) had windows, grey or black plastic wheels and a black base (see photo, Force 1988, p.&nbsp;47). Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet as well as one underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of Matchbox and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The baseplate, however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not diecast with moulded lettering as was the case with Matchbox, Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the baseplate. The front and rear axles were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the baseplate and held pinched on each side by extensions of the diecast body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate. The ref. 072 Bedford articulated lorry was a reproduction of the Meccano factory lorry, its articulated flat trailer was dimensioned to receive the Hornby Dublo container. (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). The range met with limited success and the first model was withdrawn in October 1960 having only been on sale for 18 months - there was no replacement. Within 22 months of their launch there were price reductions to 3 models. Further models were withdrawn in May 1961, September 1962 and March 1963 until in November 1963 those models that remained were taken off the shelf six years after the Dinky Dublo line was introduced. Thus ended the production of Dublo Dinky Toys under Meccano who went into receivership two years later. Five of the Dublo models enjoyed a new lease on life when Meccano was purchased by Lines Brothers. The range (see Force 1988, pp.&nbsp;165–166) and (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia) : Dinky offerings at this time were striking, but due to the lack of much competition, development of new models was perhaps a bit slow at least until July 1956 when Mettoy introduced a rival line of models under the Corgi brand name. The most obvious difference was the addition of clear plastic window glazing. While Corgi Toys called their vehicles, "The Ones With Windows", Meccano Ltd responded by updating the Dinky Toys range and the models from both companies quickly became more and more sophisticated featuring such things as working suspension, 'fingertip steering', detailed interiors, and jewelled headlights. The first model to have jewelled headlights was the no. 196 Holden Special sedan made from 1963-1969.   Truck offerings remained continuously creative including a Simca glass truck with a sheet of 'glass' (clear plastic) and a mirror (polished aluminium), a Leyland Octopus flatbed truck complete with realistic chain around the bed, a car carrier with a car carrying trailer, a Dunlop tyre rack full of tyres, a Berliet truck hauling an electrical transformer, and an intricately detailed Brockway bridgelaying truck. One of the most astounding was the Mighty Antar truck hauling a large gold ship's propeller. A wide variety of military vehicles continued under production. A rival third range of model cars also appeared in 1959 called "Spot-on" which were manufactured in Northern Ireland and produced by Tri-ang, a division of Lines Brothers. This range was kept to one scale, 1:42, also featured mainly British makes, and were comparatively more expensive, never managing to sell as many units as Corgi or Dinky Toys. To compete with Spot-on, the scale of British Dinky Toys was increased to 1:42 in 1963 (Schellekens 2010). In 1964 Tri-ang took over the parent Meccano company (which included Hornby trains as well as Meccano itself).  Since Dinky Toys were more popular, Spot-On Models were phased out in 1967, although a few cars originally designed for Spot-On were made in Hong Kong and marketed as Dinky Toys. After the take-over, Meccano continued to use the 1:42 scale for many of the English made cars and trucks until 1977. The French factory stuck to 1:43 scale, which it had used since 1947 (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). In 1967, Mattel's Hot Wheels entered the U.K. model car market. Their low-friction axles and bright paint schemes gave  play value and appeal that Dinky and other British brands did not possess. Each manufacturer responded with its own version of this innovation – Dinky's name was "Speedwheels" (Force 1988, p.&nbsp;8). The company continued to make innovative models, with all four doors opening (a first in British toy cars), retractable radio aerials (another first), Speedwheels, high quality metallic paint, and jewelled headlights (which were pretty, but not very realistic). Such features, however, were expensive to manufacture and the price could only be kept down if the quantities produced were sufficiently high, and in the face of Mattel's creation, Dinky was facing an uphill battle.  Though the writing was on the wall, Dinky's offerings in the 1970s covered the entire spectrum of vehicles, both real and fictitious. Besides the normal gamut of passenger, sports and racing cars, buses, farm, emergency and military vehicles – cars, aeroplanes and spacecraft were also offered from popular (mostly British) TV shows of the time like Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, UFO, Thunderbirds, the Pink Panther, The Secret Service, and Joe 90 (Dinky Toys 1974). It could be argued, though, that it was too little too late, as Corgi Toys had already been offering for several years vehicles from far more well-known shows and movies in the United States like Batman, The Saint, Daktari, James Bond, and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Dinky's seemingly weaker standing made it all the more susceptible to Mattel's unstoppable Hot Wheels onslaught. At least the Corgi name still survives as a well-known collectible brand. Into the 1970s, many British made Dinky vehicles lost the precision quality of detailing and proportions seen during the two previous decades. Models like no. 186 Jensen FF or no. 213 European Ford Capri were rather chunky and unrefined with thick metal door frames, imprecise grilles, and ungainly painted doors and bonnets painted in separate colors from the rest of the body. Many just did not look quite right. Others, like the no. 1453 Citroën DS Présidentielle saloon were still impressive - flying French flags, with driver, and battery operated lights (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p.&nbsp;23). Some of the truck and construction models remained very clever as well, with many moving features, like the Bedford refuse truck or the Taylor Excavator. On the other hand, French Dinky Toys, which had to compete with Solido since 1957, were much more accurate with better paint and sharper details than their English counterparts. The no. 825 DUKW military truck is a good example of the quality of French Dinky Toys (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). A second series of small scale models was introduced four years later in 1968, this time somewhat larger than the Matchbox range at 1:65. Mini-Dinky Toys, as the range was called, were of a high quality and featured opening bonnets, doors and boots and were produced in Hong Kong and the Netherlands, with some construction models designed in Italy by Mercury to a smaller 1:130 scale. In a bid to make this series stand out in toy shops, and compete against formidable competition, each model was sold in stackable red plastic garages, with clear removable top and sides. The model would slide out of a double hinged opening door to one end. This was in place of the usual cardboard box. This novel marketing feature, however, advertised as a "Free garage with every model", did not help sales, especially in light of all the excitement Mattel's Hot Wheels were causing. Some Mini-Dinkys were also blister packaged in a dark grey pack (some with garage and some not) with bright yellow lettering (Mini Dinky 2011). The very poor quality of the metal may have contributed in the poor sales figures. Although Dinky Toys were not known as widely for producing television related models as Corgi Toys, they still made a number of vehicles widely known from the small screen. Many of these models were the result of beating Corgi Toys to the signing of a licensing deal with Gerry Anderson's Century 21 Productions, whose programmes are immensely popular in the United Kingdom. The French factory produced only one TV series related model: the 1406 Renault 4 Sinpar "Michel Tanguy" (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).  In 1912 Frank Hornby set up an office in Paris on Rue Ambroise Thomas to import Meccano toys into France. By 1921, the French market had proved so successful that production of Meccano began in Paris at the newly opened factory on Rue Rebeval, with another plant opening in 1931 in Bobigny where production of the Dinky Toys range would be based. In the early days production consisted mainly of tiny model trains cast in lead, with vehicles gradually increasing in number. By the late 1930s the French Dinky Toys range had begun to diversify from that of the British parent company, concentrating on the products of the French motor manufacturers and eventually including; Citroën, Peugeot, Simca, Renault, Panhard and Ford of France (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, pp.&nbsp;62–63). During the Second World War the Meccano factory was commandeered by the invading Germans and used in the Nazi war effort. The Bobigny factory was also produced an equivalent toy to the Meccano using the Märklin name. From 1945, the model vehicles were forcibly shod with solid metal wheels and the pumps did not have rubber hoses due to the shortage of rubber which was needed for the army. In the early post war period, rubber was needed badly as the French supply came from Cambodia and Laos in war against France, rubber tyres were not fitted on models until 1950. In 1951, the headquarters and offices which were still at Rue Rebeval closed and Dinky Toys production was now solely based at Bobigny. (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia and Dinky Toys les modèles d'avant guerre, 1934 - 1940).  In 1951, French Meccano has been the first post-war European manufacturer to introduce 1:43 scale. Initially, the scales of French Dinky Toys were similar to those of English Dinkys. The Citroën Traction Avant (24N), released in 1949, was 1:48, while the Ford Vedette 1949 (24Q), released in 1950, was 1:45, the same scales as used in the British 40 series. But then, in 1946 Meccano France released their first car in 1:43 scale: the Jeep (24M) (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). By the late 1950s, Italian, German and other marques, like the Dutch DAF were also offered by Dinky Toys of France (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, pp.&nbsp;64–65). Focusing on export, American cars were also made like the late 1950s Studebaker, Chrysler's DeSoto, Buick Roadmaster, Plymouth Belvedere Coupe, Chrysler New Yorker convertible and Saratoga sedan, Ford Thunderbird "Squarebird" and Lincoln Premiere sedan (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, pp.&nbsp;66–67). 1960s cars produced by Meccano France were the first Corvair sedan, a 1967 Ford Thunderbird coupe and a 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 sedan. Some models such as the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia were produced both in France as 24M / 530 and in the UK at the Binns Road plant in Liverpool as number 187. By the 1960s there was virtually no crossover of product between the two countries resulting in a fascinating range that complemented the models. The vast majority of the French Dinky range was only available in the home market, Belgium, Switzerland, U.S.A. and other non British Commonwealth countries although a few models did make it across the English Channel both before and after the war. Similarly, some examples of the British range of Dinky Toys were exported to France at the same time. The factory at Bobigny closed in 1970 and production moved to Calais where the range continued to be manufactured until closure in 1971. A contract had been signed with the Spanish firm Auto Pilen who received some tools and produced some models both as Dinkys and Auto-Pilens. (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia and Dinky Toys les modèles d'avant guerre, 1934 - 1940). As import duties were high on finished goods and reduced on components, to get into the Spanish market, Meccano s.a. (France) exported sixteen unpainted and unassembled Dinky Toys to The Novades Poch Company in Barcelona. There the models were finished and fitted with specific Pirelli tyres. The models are : In 1974 labour was getting too expensive in France, and Meccano subcontracted the manufacture of some models to Auto Pilen s.a. in Spain. These models had already been made in France and were sold exclusively under the marque Dinky. When the Calais factory closed down some of the recent tools were sent to Liverpool where the models were produced with new baseplates. Some of these tools were later sent to Auto-Pilen where they were modified or updated before; being re-issued, however it is not known if the dies were modified by Meccano or by Pilen. These models were sold in France under the marque Dinky, they were clearly identified as Dinky and as MADE IN SPAIN on the base plate. In Spain they were sold as Pilen and marked as such. Pilen models, most of which were Dinky dies, were very popular and numerous in Spain and commonly sold in El Corte Engles and Galerias Preciados department stores. According to a contract between Meccano s.a. and Pilen, the last five so called French Dinkys were in fact Pilen models designed and tooled in Algeciras and fitted with a Dinky Toys base plate. Like the previous series, they were sold in France as Dinky and are very rare and as Pilen in Spain. (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). They were : Meccano Ltd exported Dinky Toys to all of the United Kingdom's old colonies relatively cheaply because of existing Commonwealth trade agreements. South Africa was one of its big importers.  Around 1952 -54, Meccano Ltd shipped to South Africa a limited edition set of vehicles for the South African Defence Force. This set included a Motor Truck, a Covered Wagon, an Ambulance, a Dispatch Rider, a Van, a petrol tanker, a fire engine, a road roller, a Mechanical horse and trailer, a loudspeaker van. (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). When South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961, it imposed a luxury goods import tax, making Dinky Toys very expensive – a potential loss for Meccano Ltd. To resolve this problem, Meccano Ltd began shipping Dinky Toy parts to South Africa in 1962 where models were assembled and painted locally. The import of unfinished goods was not subject to the tax. These models were sold in South Africa between 1962 and 1963 and it is believed that only one batch of each model was produced, making South African Dinky Toys very rare. South Africa also imported Dinky Toys parts from the French factory in 1966 and six models were assembled and painted locally (Binns Road website). Some of the distinguishing features of South African Dinky Toys are : South African Dinky Toys from Liverpool. South African Dinky Toys from Bobigny. Circa 1967 - 1973, For the same reason as the Dinky Toys were assembled in South Africa, some were finished in Arica a tax free harbour at the very north of Chile. Only twelve models are known today, those which in England were packed in cristal boxes were provided in Chile in specific yellow end flaps boxes printed with "Armado en Arica" which means "Assembled in Arica" and the logo of the manufacturer. These models were painted in different colours from those made in England. These are the models known, there may be more to uncover : (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia) Original British-made Dinky Toys had been available in select cities in India from pre-war days until about 1955, when import curbs on toys came into effect. Old stocks of original Dinky toys continued to be available for a few years in Calcutta and other metro areas until supplies were exhausted. Later, similar to how Corgis became Milton Toys and Matchboxes became Maxwells in India, Dinkys eventually appeared there under a distinct name. In 1963, Meccano closed its Speke factory and sold the dies, the casting machines and remains of spare parts and yellow boxes to  S. Kumar & Co. in Calcutta, India. Toys were marketed as Atamco Ltd. products. The toys were first assembled with parts made in Liverpool and packed in original yellow boxes with the Dinky Toys name. The quality was very poor and it is believed that Meccano Ltd. asked S. Kumar & Co. not to use the Dinky name. Kumar then applied stickers with the name NICKY on the boxes to hide the name DINKY. Later when the stock of original boxes ran out, NICKY TOYS boxes of poor quality were printed in India (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia). These were selected Dinky dies, and not the whole British range – with only 32 different cars and trucks produced. Several aeroplanes were also made. Though appalling, paint quality was more spotty, wheels were often a simpler unattractive plastic and the touch-up on highlights was more crudely applied than on the original British models. In September 2011, a Nicky Toys catalogue sold on eBay for $105.00, so collectability doesn't only apply to original British and French Dinky Toys. Between 1965 and 1967 six model cars were produced for Dinky Toys in Hong Kong for the lucrative U.S. market. Originally intended to be produced by Spot-On, but re-branded as Dinky Toys when the Spot-On parent company (Tri-ang) bought Meccano Ltd, they were built to the usual Spot-On scale of 1:42. These were all American vehicles: During 1978 and 1979, production of Dinky Toys in Hong Kong was again resumed. These were poor quality models, however, compared to earlier Dinkys, and an attempt to cut production costs and possibly shift production should the Binns Road Factory close, which it eventually did. So, the last new Dinky Toys made by Meccano were Hong Kong products. Ironically, these are now some of the most sought after of all Dinky Toys. A few, such as the Mk2 Ford Granada, and Steed's Jaguar from the New Avengers TV series exist as pre-production examples only. Changing fashions in the toy industry, international competition and the switch to cheap labour in lower wage countries meant that the days of British-made toy vehicles like Dinky Toys were numbered. After attempts at simplifying the products as a means of saving costs, the famous Binns Road factory in Liverpool finally closed its doors in November 1979. By comparison, Corgi Toys managed to struggle on until 1983. Matchbox was taken over by Universal International of Hong Kong in 1982 (McGimpsey & Orr 1989, p.&nbsp;28). Thus ended the era when UK-made die-cast toy models were dominant. The Dinky trade-name changed hands many times before ending up as part of Matchbox International Ltd in the late 1980s. This seemed to be a logical and perhaps synergistic development, uniting two of the most valuable and venerated names in the British and world die-cast model car market under one roof. For a time some Matchbox vehicles were sold under the Dinky name (Stoneback 2002, p.&nbsp;24). In the 1980s, Matchbox began issuing model cars of the 1950s and 1960s through the 'Dinky Collection' – these models were marketed toward adult collectors. The models, like a Wolseley Hornet, were attractive and honoured the tradition of the Dinky name in terms of both quality and scale, and resembled Lledo's  Vanguard range.  Still, production stopped after only a few years. The 'Dinky Collection' eventually was absorbed into a themed series offered by Matchbox Collectibles Inc, owned by the US giant Mattel - which portrayed little interest in any historical honoring of the Dinky brand. Mattel has preferred to occasionally re-badge normal Matchbox models with the Dinky name for some editions in certain markets. In some cases 1:43 scale models from the Matchbox era were sometimes given the Dinky name. No new "dedicated" Dinky castings have been created in the Mattel era since Matchbox Collectibles was shut down in 2000.
