Seventy-eight bombers (9.5 percent of the force) fail to return – Bomber Commands highest losses on a single raid thus far in World War II – and the high loss rate among Halifaxes (34 aircraft, or 13.3 percent of the Halifaxes dispatched and 14.9 of those which do not turn back early) prompts Bomber Command to withdraw Halifax IIs and Halifax Vs permanently from further operations over Germany. February 20 – The U.S. Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force begins Operation Argument, a six-day campaign to defeat the Luftwaffe by staging major attacks on the German aircraft industry while luring Luftwaffe aircraft into aerial combat; the operation later becomes known informally as "Big Week."

Unable to reach their primary target, Schweinfurt, 162 B-17 Flying Fortresses of the U.S. Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force instead bomb Frankfurt-am-Main. The Frankfurt-am-Main diary states, "The three air raids of 18th, 22nd, and 24th March were carried out by a combined plan of the British and American air forces and their combined effect was to deal the worst and most fateful blow of the war to Frankfurt, a blow which simply ended the existence of the Frankfurt which had been built up since the Middle Ages." March 24–25 (overnight) – 811 bombers carry out the last major British raid on Berlin of World War II. Strong winds carry them off course and most of their bombs are scattered.

The U.S. Army Air Forces Fifth Air Force launches its first large daylight strike, attacking Japanese airfields in the Hollandia area on New Guinea, using 80 B-24 Liberators and 59 P-38 Lightnings the first day and similar strnegth the second day. They catch most of the Japanese planes in the area parked on the ground and claim 199 of them destroyed.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VIII: New Guinea and the Marianas, March 1944-August 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1989, pp. 35–36. March 30–31 (overnight) – 795 British bombers attack Nuremberg, Germany, in bright moonlight, counting for protection on predicted high cloud cover which does not materialize. German night fighters intercept them over Belgium before they cross the German border and continue to attack them for the next hour, shooting down 82 bombers as they fly to Nuremberg and over the target. Another 13 bombers are lost on the return flight, and the total of 95 bombers lost (11.9 percent of the force) is the highest Bomber Command loss on a single raid during World War II. The raid inflicts little damage on Nuremberg due to cloud cover, wind, and poor target marking which cause most of the bombs to land in open countryside, and 120 aircraft mistakenly bomb Schweinfurt, where they scatter their bombs widely, also hitting mostly open countryside and killing two people. Pilot Officer Cyril Joe Barton, the pilot of a Halifax, pushes through to Nuremberg despite heavy damage to his bomber by a night fighter attack, then brings the aircraft home and dies in crash landing with only minor injuries to his crew. He posthumously receives the Victoria Cross. March 31 Task Force 58 aircraft strike Yap. A flying boat carrying Admiral Mineichi Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navys Combined Fleet, disappears after taking off from Babelthuap; no wreckage or bodies are ever found.

The United States Coast Guard begins to experiment with dipping sonar as it leads the United States Department of the Navys effort to develop the helicopter as an antisubmarine warfare platform. Although the German Luftwaffe continues to use radio-guided bombs against Allied ships operating off the Anzio beachhead, they become less effective as the defense against them put up by Allied destroyers improves.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of U.S. Naval Operations in World War II, Volume IX: Sicily-Salerno-Anzio, January 1943-June 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1990, p. 371.

The German Luftwaffe tests 50 Henschel Hs 117 surface-to-air missiles, some of them dropped from a Heinkel He 111 to test their viability as air-to-air missiles. Over half he missies fail, but mass production of the Hs 117 will be ordered in December. The Allies come into possession of a German manned, towed Focke-Achgelis Fa 330 autogyro kite for the first time when they capture the submarine U-852 intact with an Fa 330 stowed on board.Focke-Achgelis Fa 330A-1 "Bachstelze"&nbsp;— Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum article at the Internet Archive.

The bombs are scattered at Malines, but the other strikes are accurate, and after 500 bomb hits the railway depot at Chambly is out of service for 10 days.Royal Air Force Bomber Command 60th Anniversary Campaign Diary May 1944 May 3–4 (overnight) 360 British bombers attack a German military camp outside Mailly, France. German night fighters intercept them and 42 bombers (11.6 percent of the force) are shot down. The bombers drop 1,500 long tons (1,689 short tons; 1,524 metric tons) of bombs very accurately, hitting 114 barracks buildings, 47 transport sheds, and some ammunition buildings and destroying 37 tanks and 65 other vehicles. 92 British bombers strike the Luftwaffe airfield at Montdidier, France, with the loss of four aircraft, causing much damage in the northern part of the airfield. May 6–7 (overnight) – 269 British bombers raid railway facilities at Mantes-la-Jolie, France, and ammunition dumps at Sablé-sur-Sarthe and Aubigné, France. The latter two raids are successful, but at Mantes-la-Jolie most bombs hit towns and residential area rather than the railway yard. Air Commodore Ronald Ivelaw-Chapman is the second pilot aboard the only bomber lost on the Aubigné raid; he is captured by the Germans, who never realize his seniority and what intelligence they could have gathered from him. May 7–8 (overnight) – 341 British bombers attack five targets in France with the loss of 10 aircraft. They damage airfields at Nantes and Tours and a German ammunition dump at Salbris, but scatter their bombs onto a nearby village when attacking the airfield and an ammunition dump at Rennes and narrowly miss a coastal artillery position at St. Valery.

Bode and Gerstenhauer use a cargo net to recover all major components of both downed aircraft, providing the Luftwaffe with valuable experience in the possibility of using helicopters for transportation in mountainous areas. May 11–12 (overnight) – 693 British bombers strike a German military camp at Bourg Léopold, Belgium; railway yards at Hasselt, Belgium, and Boulogne, Louvain, and Trouville, France; and a gun position at Colline Beaumont, France. The Bourg Léopold and Hasselt raids fail due to haze over the target, most of the Boulogne bombs hit housing and kill 128 French civilians, and the Colline Beaumont strike produces unclear results, but the Trouville attack is successful and the one at Louvain partially so.

July 4–5 (overnight) 246 British bombers attack the underground V-1 site at Saint-Leu-d'Esserent, France, using 1,000-pound (454-kg) bombs in an attempt to cut all German communications with the site. The attack is accurate, but German fighters intercept and shoot down 13 bombers. 287 British bombers attack railway yards at Orleans and Villeneuve, France. Fourteen bombers are lost. July 5 – After a P-38 Lightning tows it into the air, the MX-324 becomes the first American rocket-powered aircraft to fly under its own power.Mondey, David, ed., The Complete Illustrated History of the Worlds Aircraft, Secaucus, New Jersey: Chartwell Books, Inc., 1978, ISBN 0-89009-771-2, p. 89.

July 6 – 550 British bombers and one Royal Air Force Mustang attack five V-weapon sites, with at least four of them bombed accurately. One aircraft, a Halifax, is lost. After the raid, four officers of No. 617 Squadron – Wing Commander Leonard Cheshire and Flight Lieutenants J. C. McCarthy, K. L. Munro, and Dave Shannon – are ordered to leave the squadron and rest. Cheshire, who has completed four tours and 100 operations, will never fly in combat again, but will receive the Victoria Cross two months later for his courage and work in developing low-level target marking during his Bomber Command service. July 7 – 467 British Bomber Command aircraft accurately drop 2,267 long tons (2,303 metric tons) of bombs on northern Caen, France, and nearby open ground in an evening raid in an effort to assist British and Canadian ground forces in breaking through German defenses in Normandy.

One Lancaster and one Halifax do not return. July 10 – 233 British bombers attack a V-1 flying bomb storage dump at Nucourt, France, but their bombs are scattered due to cloud cover. All of the bombers return safely. July 11 In a raid on a V-1 flying bomb site at Grapennes, France, 26 British Lancasters make the first "heavy Oboe" raid of World War II. In this new technique, a Lancaster fitted with Oboe rather than a Mosquito leads the heavy bombers to the target, with other bombers in its formation dropping their bombs when it does, allowing a greater tonnage of bombs to be dropped directly on Oboe signals. The new tactic becomes Bomber Commands most accurate, allowing effective bombing of small targets like V-1 sites even through clouds. All of the Lancasters and all six Mosquitos which attack the same target separately return without loss. A USAAF Douglas A-26 Invader crashes in late afternoon fog into a temporary trailer park in South Portland, Maine on approach to Portland-Westbrook Municipal Airport (now Portland International Jetport), killing both men on board.
