 The Lone Star Conference (LSC) is a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II level. Member institutions are located in the southwestern United States, with schools in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The conference was formed in 1931 when five schools withdrew from the old Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Charter members included East Texas State (now Texas A&M–Commerce), North Texas State (now North Texas), Sam Houston State, Southwest Texas State (now Texas State), and Stephen F. Austin. Only Texas A&M–Commerce is still a member of LSC and in Division II; the other schools moved up to Division I, with North Texas and Texas State in the top-level FBS while Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston entered second-tier FCS.

Discussion centered on universities in Oklahoma and Arkansas that had applied to NCAA Division II and the rationale for expansion.
