    Lambert–St. Louis International Airport  is an international airport serving Greater St. Louis, Missouri, United States. It is about  northwest of downtown St. Louis in unincorporated St. Louis County between Berkeley and Bridgeton. Commonly named Lambert Field, it is the largest and busiest airport in the state with 255 daily departures to about 90 domestic and international locations. In 2014, 12.4 million passengers traveled through the airport. The airport serves as a hub for Air Choice One and Cape Air, focus city for Southwest Airlines and was a former hub for Trans World Airlines and later for American Airlines.   It is the primary airport serving the St. Louis area, with MidAmerica St. Louis Airport, located about 37 miles (59 km) east, serving as a secondary metropolitan airport.  The two airports are connected by the city's rail mass transit Red Line of the St. Louis MetroLink. Named for Albert Bond Lambert, an Olympic medalist and prominent St. Louis aviator, the airport rose to international prominence in the 20th century, thanks to its association with Charles Lindbergh, its groundbreaking air traffic control, its status as the hub of Trans World Airlines and its iconic terminal. Designed by Minoru Yamasaki, the building inspired terminals at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City and Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France.    The airport grew from a balloon launching base, Kinloch Field, part of the 1890s Kinloch Park suburban development. The Wright brothers and their Exhibition Team visited the field while touring with their aircraft. During a visit to St. Louis, Theodore Roosevelt flew with pilot Arch Hoxsey on October 11, 1910, becoming the first U.S. president to fly. Later, Kinloch hosted the first experimental parachute jump. In June 1920, the Aero Club of St. Louis leased 170 acres of cornfield, the defunct Kinloch Racing Track and the Kinloch Airfield in October 1923, during The International Air Races. The field was officially dedicated as Lambert–St. Louis Flying Field in honor of Albert Bond Lambert, an Olympic silver medalist golfer in the 1904 Summer Games, president of Lambert Pharmaceutical Corporation (which made Listerine), and the first person to receive a pilot's license in St. Louis. In February 1925, "Major" (his 'rank' was given by the Aero Club and not the military) Lambert bought the field and added hangars and a passenger terminal. Charles Lindbergh's first piloting job was flying airmail for Robertson Aircraft Corporation from Lambert Field; he left the airport for New York about a week before his record-breaking flight to Paris in 1927. Later that year, Lambert sold the airport to the City of St. Louis, making it the first municipally-owned airport in the United States.<ref name="LH">{{cite web |url=http://lambert-stlouis.com/index/about_History.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050204222910/http://lambert-stlouis.com/index/about_History.html |title=The History of Lambert – St. Louis International Airport |work= Lambert-St. Louis International Airport |accessdate=December 26, 2012|publisher= Lambert-St. Louis International Airport | year=2005 | archivedate= February 4, 2005}}</ref>  In the late 1920s, Lambert Field became the first airport with an [[air traffic control]] system—albeit one that communicated with pilots via waving flags.

[[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) was headquartered at [[Kansas City International Airport]] and had large operations at [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport]] as well as St. Louis. TWA deemed Kansas City too small, and its terminals unsuitable, to serve as a primary hub. TWA reluctantly ruled out Chicago, as its Chicago operation was already losing $25 million a year under competition from [[American Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]]. This meant that St. Louis was the carrier's only viable option. TWA proceeded to downsize Chicago and build up St. Louis, swapping three Chicago gates for five of American's St. Louis gates. By December 1982, St. Louis accounted for 20% of TWA's domestic capacity. Lambert's terminal was initially too small for this operation, and TWA was forced to use temporary terminals, mobile lounges and airstairs to handle the additional flights.<ref>{{cite news|title=STL: How To Build A Hub|url=http://statehistoricalsocietyofmissouri.org/cdm/ref/collection/twa/id/8132|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=TWA Mainliner|date=11 October 1982}}</ref> After Concourse D was completed in 1985, TWA began transatlantic service from Lambert to London, Frankfurt and Paris.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://flystl.com/AboutLambert/History.aspx|publisher=Lambert-St. Louis International Airport|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>  In 1985, [[Southwest Airlines]] began service, an event that would lead to major changes at the airport in the coming years.  TWA's hub grew again in 1986 when the airline bought Ozark Airlines, which operated its hub from Lambert's Concourse B,C & D. In 1985, TWA had accounted for 56.6% of boardings at STL while Ozark accounted for 26.3%, so the merged carriers now controlled over 80% of the traffic.<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/assets/80/77171.pdf Fare and Service Changes at St. Louis Since the TWA-Ozark Merger], United States General Accounting Office.

Despite the entry of Southwest Airlines in the market, the TWA buyout of Ozark and subsequent increase in the number of nonstop cities served, the total number of passengers using Lambert held steady from 1985 through 1993, ranging between 19 million and 20 million passengers per year throughout the period.  Lambert again grew in importance for TWA after the airline declared bankruptcy in 1993 and moved its headquarters to St. Louis from Mount Kisco, NY. TWA increased the number of cities served and started routing more connecting passengers through its hub at Lambert. Total number of passengers using Lambert rose from 19.9 million passengers enplaned in 1993, jumping almost 20% in one year to 23.4 million in 1994. Growth continued, with total enplaned jumping to 27.3 million by 1997 and 30.6 million in 2000, the highest ever in its history.<ref>Lambert-St. Louis International Airport website, [[Historical Passenger Statistics since 1985]], retrieved July 27, 2013.</ref> By the late 1990s, Lambert was TWA's dominant hub, with 515 daily flights to 104 cities as of September 1999. Of those 515 flights, 352 were on TWA mainline aircraft and 163 were Trans World Connection flights operated by its commuter airline partners.  However, TWA faced increasing problems as overall airline demand softened in response to a softening overall economy. As TWA entered the new millennium, its financial condition proved too precarious to continue alone and in January 2001 American Airlines (AA) announced it was buying TWA.  === American Airlines, Air National Guard, Southwest Airlines 2001–present ===  American Airline's merger closed in April 2001 and the last TWA flight was flown on December 1, 2001. AA felt that TWA's Lambert hub was a key asset. Its plan for Lambert was to become a reliever hub for AA's existing hubs at [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]] and [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]]. American had been looking for a way to relieve its overcrowded hub at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, where nearly 40 percent of American's flights had arrived at least 15 minutes late in June, July and August 2000. American was looking at something strategic with its new St. Louis hub to potentially offload some of the pressure on O'Hare to restore its operations to respectable levels. American Airlines shifted some flights from mainline aircraft to commuter aircraft because of softening overall airline demand, however, overall flight levels remained strong. In July 2001, TWA, now a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines and its regional carrier Trans World Express averaged 522 daily departures.<ref name=":1">http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg22610.html CaliforniaAviation.org, retrieved July 20, 2013</ref>  The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were a huge demand shock to air service nationwide, with total airline industry domestic revenue passenger miles dropping 20% in October 2001 and 17% in November 2001.<ref>[[U.S. Air Carrier Traffic Statistics - Domestic Passengers - Revenue Passenger Miles]], retrieved July 27, 2013</ref> Overnight, AA no longer had the same need for a hub that bypasses its hubs at Chicago and Dallas, which suddenly became less congested.<ref name=":0">http://www.dallasnews.com/business/airline-industry/20130126-american-airlines-battles-a-history-of-unsuccessful-mergers.ece "American Airlines, a History of Unsuccessful Mergers, Dallas News website, retrieved July 20, 2013</ref> AA cut flights out of St. Louis from 522 daily flights as of July 2001, to approximately 450 flights as of December 2001. Flights to Paris, France went to seasonal service in December 2001 and transatlantic service was soon discontinued altogether when it stopped flying nonstop from St. Louis to London Gatwick airport. AA transferred many mainline routes to [[American Connection]], a group of affiliated regional carriers. By June 2002, AA had further reduced service to 439 daily flights to 109 cities, however, only 276 of those flights were on AA mainline aircraft and 163 were flown on commuter aircraft operated as American Connection. At the time, Lambert was AA's 3rd largest hub ranked by number of daily departures and its 2nd largest hub ranked by number of destinations served. AA's largest hub at the time was DFW, with 757 daily flights to 145 destinations. AA's Chicago O'Hare hub had 489 daily flights to 102 destinations, STL had 439 flights to 109 destinations, while its Miami hub had just 236 flights to 79 destinations. Much of the reduction in overall service could be blamed on the 9/11 terrorist attacks, however, Lambert was affected disproportionately due to flight cuts and shifts of flights from mainline to commuter aircraft, because of Lambert's lessened need as a reliever hub since O'Hare was suddenly less congested.  By September 2002, Lambert's passenger traffic had declined by 16.9% from before the terrorist attacks a year earlier, which was the 8th biggest percentage drop of the major US airports. Total passengers enplaned for the year fell to 25.6 million. AA's other hubs suffered from reduced traffic, but to a lesser degree with the exception of Miami, which suffered from a 16.0% decline. New York JFK's traffic dropped 12.6%, DFW traffic dropped 6.7%, O'Hare traffic dropped 6.5%.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/news/2002/09-10-flights.htm#chart USA Today, retrieved July 20, 2013]</ref> Even though O'Hare's drop in traffic was the lowest, the 6.5% reduction at O'Hare was enough to virtually eliminate its previous problems with congestion-related delays that suffered from prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, removing a main purpose for AA's St. Louis hub. As a result of the reduced congestion at O'Hare, Congress eliminated all slot restrictions at O'Hare in July 2002.<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/comments/209455.htm Department of Justice, Congestion and Delay Reductions at O'Hare Airport, retrieved July 20, 2013.]</ref>  On July 16, 2003, AA announced it was significantly reducing its Lambert hub effective November 1, 2003, cutting it from 417 daily flights to 207, effective November 1, 2003.<ref>[http://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/AA-to-cut-back-St--Louis-operations/ Travel Weekly website, retrieved July 20, 2013.]</ref> Total Lambert passengers enplaned dropped to 20.4 million in 2003, then to 13.4 million in 2004. AA introduced American Eagle service at its St. Louis hub in May 2005. Unlike American Connection, [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] operated by [[Envoy Air]] is wholly owned by [[American Airlines Group]], the parent company of American Airlines and [[Envoy Air]].  In 2006, the [[United States Air Force]] announced plans to turn the [[131st Fighter Wing]] of the [[Missouri Air National Guard]] into the 131st Bomb Wing. The wing's 20 F-15C and F-15D aircraft were moved to the [[Montana Air National Guard]]'s [[120th Fighter Wing]] at [[Great Falls International Airport]]/Air National Guard Base, [[Montana]] and the [[Hawaii Air National Guard]]'s [[154th Wing]] at [[Hickam AFB]], Hawaii. The pilots and maintainers moved to [[Whiteman AFB]], Missouri to fly and maintain the [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber as the first [[Air National Guard]] wing to fly the aircraft. '''Lambert Field Air National Guard Base''' formally shut down in June 2009, when the final two F-15C Eagles did a low approach over the field, then flew away. The event was attended by more than 2,200 people who said goodbye to a part of airport history for over 85 years.  Lambert's passenger traffic slowly rebounded from American Airlines' cuts of November 2003, increasing from a low of 13.4 million passengers enplaned in 2004, to 15.4 million by 2007 and increase of almost 15 percent.  During 2008, Lambert's position as an American Airlines hub faced further pressure due to increased fuel costs and softened demand because of a depressed economy. AA cut its overall system capacity by 5% during 2008. At Lambert, AA shifted even more flights from its mainline jets to commuter airplanes.<ref>[http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2008/05/fuel-cost-fallout-aa-is-latest-carrier-to-cut-routes-flights/770991/1 USA Today, Fuel-Cost Fallout: American Airlines is the latest carrier to cut routes, flights, retrieved July 26, 2013]</ref> Total passengers enplaned fell 6% to 14.4 million in 2008, then fell another 11% to 12.8 million passengers in 2009.

Worth, Miami and New York, with a focus city in Los Angeles. While it cut approximately 165 daily flights from St. Louis, AA increased flights at O'Hare by 57 daily flights and by 15 new destinations, to a new total of 487 daily flights to 114 destinations. Ironically, due to soft overall airline demand, the O'Hare hub actually lost a net 11 daily mainline flights, offset by 68 new regional jet flights. At its DFW hub, AA increased flights by 19 daily flight and one additional destination, for a new total of 780 daily flights to 160 destinations.

Congestion caused delays during peak hours and was exacerbated when bad weather reduced the number of usable runways from three to one.

The MD-82 was taking off for Denver and had accelerated through 80 knots when the collision occurred. The MD-82 sustained substantial damage during the collision. The Cessna 441, operated by Superior Aviation, was destroyed. The pilot and the passenger were killed. PROBABLE CAUSE: "The Cessna 441 pilot’s mistaken belief that his assigned departure runway was runway 30R, which resulted in his undetected entrance onto runway 30R, which was being used by the MD-82 for its departure. Contributing to the accident was the lack of Automatic Terminal Information Service and other air traffic control (ATC) information regarding the occasional use of runway 31 for departure. The installation and utilization of Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE-3) and particularly ASDE-3 enhanced with the Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS), could have prevented this accident."  ==In popular culture== ===Television=== * In the "[[NewsRadio season 3#Airport|Airport]]" episode of the television show ''[[Newsradio]]'', bad weather keeps Bill and Dave at Lambert for the entire show. * In "[[The Airport (Seinfeld episode)|The Airport]]" episode of the television show ''[[Seinfeld]]'', [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] and [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] leave from Lambert. * In the "[[Meg and Quagmire]]" episode of the television show ''[[Family Guy]]'', [[Glenn Quagmire]] tells a story about landing at Lambert.  ===Film=== * In the 1986 film ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'', FBI agents fly into Lambert during their pursuit of the killer. * In the 1987 film ''[[Planes, Trains & Automobiles]]'', Neal Page ([[Steve Martin]]) attempts to rent a car at Lambert, with disastrous (and profanity-laden) consequences.<ref name="SLPD 2009-12-11"/><ref name="CDT 2011-03-13">{{cite news |title=Missouri Boasts a Proud History of Being on the Silver Screen|first=Caroline|last=Dohack-McCrary|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2011/mar/13/through-the-lens/|newspaper=[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]|date=March 13, 2011|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref> * Part of the 1991 film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' was shot at Lambert. * In the 2003 film ''[[Anger Management (film)|Anger Management]]'', Dave Buznik ([[Adam Sandler]]) takes a flight to Lambert. * Part of the 2006 film ''[[The Lucky Ones (film)|The Lucky Ones]]'', set in Austin, Texas, was shot at Lambert.<ref name="SLPD 2009-12-11" /><ref name="CDT 2011-03-13" /> * One scene from the 2009 film ''[[The Informant!]]'', directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]], was filmed at Lambert.<ref name="CDT 2011-03-13" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Steven Soderbergh, Film Revolutionary|first=Joe|last=Williams|url=http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/joes-movie-lounge/joes-movie-lounge/2009/01/steven-soderbergh-film-revolutionary/|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=January 28, 2009|accessdate=January 29, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> * The 2009 film ''[[Up in the Air (2009 film)|Up in the Air]]'' was filmed in the St. Louis area, including in Lambert's Concourse D, between March 3 and the end of April 2009.
