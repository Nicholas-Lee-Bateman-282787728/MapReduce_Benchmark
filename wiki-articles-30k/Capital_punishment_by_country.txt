  The following is a summary of the use of capital punishment by country.   Historically, capital punishment has been used in almost every part of the world. Currently, the large majority of countries have either abolished or discontinued the practice. The use of capital punishment is usually divided into the four categories set out below. As of July 2015, of the 196 independent states that are UN members or have UN observer status: Recent complete abolition of capital punishment Gabon (2010), Latvia (2012), Benin (2012), Mongolia (2012), Madagascar (2012), Chad (2014, restored for terrorism in 2015), Fiji (2015), and Suriname (2015) Of the countries generally considered to be in the Western society (relatively wealthy, stable functional democracies with well-educated populations), just five countries continue to perform capital punishment: the United States, Japan, Singapore, St. Kitts & Nevis, and Taiwan. In South Korea, there is a moratorium. The European Union holds a strong position against the death penalty; its abolition is a key objective for the Union’s human rights policy. Abolition is also a pre-condition for entry into the Union. In Europe, only Belarus continues to execute people.http://eeas.europa.eu/human_rights/adp/index_en.htm Most executions worldwide take place in Asia.  China is the world's most active executioner. North Korea often uses the death penalty.  In Islamic countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, the numbers of executions are also very high.  India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan belong to the few industrialized democracies that still have the death penalty (South Korea has a moratorium).  Of the former Soviet republics, only Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan have the death penalty. In Kazakhstan, it is only used in exceptional/special circumstances such as for crimes committed in wartime. In Africa, it is chiefly Islamic countries that use the death penalty. Chad repealed the death penalty in 2014, but restored it for terrorism in 2015. Botswana and Equatorial Guinea are examples of non-Islamic countries that still execute people. In Central and South America, the death penalty still exists in Belize, Guatemala, Guyana, and in the Caribbean countries (it does not exist in the Dominican Republic and in Haiti; the other Caribbean countries except St. Kitts & Nevis are currently regarded as de facto abolitionists). In Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, and Peru, it is used only in exceptional/special circumstances such as for crimes committed in wartime. Worldwide, 94 countries still have capital punishment in their lawbooks, and 37 of them currently perform executions: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brunei, China (not in Hong Kong and Macao), Cuba, Egypt, India (option when second conviction for drug trafficking in quantities specified), Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Laos, Malaysia, Morocco, North Korea, Oman, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Somalia, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Syria, Sudan, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United States (only under certain conditions), Vietnam, Yemen, Zimbabwe.

In the hundred years following the abolition of capital punishment by Venezuela in 1863 only 10 more countries were able to maintain abolition – although more tried but failed to prevent re-instatement after an initial abolition. From the 1960s there has been a growing momentum towards abolition worldwide. In the 1960s 4 countries abolished (a record up to that time for any decade), in the 1970s a limited momentum was achieved when 10 countries abolished, the 1980s saw a further 9 countries abolish, but it was the fall of Communism in 1989 which turned the trickle into a torrent – no fewer than 34 countries abolished in the 1990s, the individual years 1990 and 1998 are especially notable because 8 and 7 countries respectively abolished in those single years. This momentum is continuing as a further 26 countries abolished in the first decade of this century. Since 1985, there have been only four years when no country has abolished the death penalty: 1988, 2003, 2011 and 2013. Note: Where a country has abolished, re-instated, and abolished again (e.g. Philippines, Switzerland, Portugal) only the later abolition date is included. Countries who have abolished and since reinstated (e.g. Liberia) are not included. Non-independent territories are considered to be under the jurisdiction of their parent country – which leads to unexpectedly late abolition dates for the UK, New Zealand and the Netherlands, where Jersey (UK), the Cook Is (NZ), and the Netherlands Antilles, were the last territories of those states to abolish capital punishment, and all were rather later than the more well known abolitions on the respective mainlands. Defunct countries such as the GDR (East Germany), which abolished capital punishment in 1987 but was dissolved in 1990, are also not included.
