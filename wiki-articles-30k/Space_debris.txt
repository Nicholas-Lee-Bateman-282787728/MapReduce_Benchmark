    Space/orbital debris/junk/waste is the collection of defunct man-made objects in space – old satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragments from disintegration, erosion, and collisions – including those caused by debris itself.

Below 2000&nbsp;km debris are denser than meteoroids; mostly dust from solid rocket motors, surface erosion debris like paint flakes, and frozen coolant from RORSAT nuclear-powered satellites. They cause damage akin to sandblasting, especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or star trackers that can not be covered with a ballistic Whipple shield (unless it is transparent). For comparison, the International Space Station orbits in the  range and the 2009 satellite collision and 2007 antisat test occurred at . The ISS has Whipple shielding, however known debris with a collision chance over 1/10000 are avoided by maneuvering the spacecraft. Beyond a critical density, Kessler syndrome ensues — a runaway chain reaction of collisions exponentially increasing the amount of debris. This affects useful polar-orbiting bands, increases the cost of protection for missions and destroys live satellites. Whether it is already underway is debated.Lisa Grossman, "NASA Considers Shooting Space Junk with Lasers", wired, 15 March 2011. The measurement, mitigation and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the space industry. There are over 100 million pieces of debris smaller than  as of March 2012.

Using a 2008 figure of 8,500 known items, it is estimated at .Robin McKie and Michael Day, "Warning of catastrophe from mass of 'space junk'" The Observer, 24 February 2008. In LEO there are few "universal orbits" which keep spacecraft in particular rings (in contrast to GEO, a single widely used orbit). The closest are sun-synchronous orbits that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the orbital plane; they are polar, meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects (the density of objects is much higher in LEO).Matt Ford, "Orbiting space junk heightens risk of satellite catastrophes." Ars Technica, 27 February 2009. Orbits are further changed by perturbations (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth's gravitational field), and collisions can occur from any direction. For these reasons, the Kessler syndrome applies mostly to the LEO region; impacts occur at up to 16&nbsp;km/s (twice the orbital speed) if head-on - the 2009 satellite collision occurred at 11.7&nbsp;km/s,"What are hypervelocity impacts?" ESA, 19 February 2009. creating much spall in the critical size range. These can cross other orbits and lead to a cascade effect. A large-enough collision (e.g. between a space station and a defunct satellite) could make low Earth orbit impossible. Manned missions are mostly at  and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. Atmospheric expansion as a result of space weather raises the critical altitude by increasing drag; in the 90s, it was a factor in reduced debris density. Another was fewer launches by Russia; the USSR made most of the launches in the 1970s and 1980s.Klinkrad, p. 7. At higher altitudes, where is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight atmospheric drag, lunar perturbations, Earth's gravity perturbations, solar wind and solar radiation pressure can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take millennia.Kessler 1991, p. 268. Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly. Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbits (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as Telstar 401) it assumes a geosynchronous orbit; its orbital inclination increases about .8° and its speed increases about  per year. Impact velocity peaks at about . Orbital perturbations cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and precession of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year."Colocation Strategy and Collision Avoidance for the Geostationary Satellites at 19 Degrees West." CNES Symposium on Space Dynamics, 6–10 November 1989. The collision debris pose less short-term risk than from an LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as solar-power satellites, are especially vulnerable to collisions.J. C. van der Ha and M. Hechler, "The Collision Probability of Geostationary Satellites" 32nd International Astronautical Congress, 1981, p. 23. Although the ITU now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan, studies suggest this is insufficient.L. Anselmo and C. Pardini, "Collision Risk Mitigation in Geostationary Orbit", Space Debris, Volume 2 Number 2 (June 2000), pp. 67 – 82.  Since GEO orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under , the nature of the problem is not well known.Orbital Debris, p. 86. Satellites could be moved to empty spots in GEO, requiring less maneuvering and making it easier to predict future motion.Orbital Debris, p. 152. Satellites or boosters in other orbits, especially stranded in geostationary transfer orbit, are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity. Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The European Space Agency telecom satellite Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit."The Olympus failure" ESA press release, 26 August 1993.   On 24 July 1996 Cerise, a French microsatellite in a Sun-synchronous LEO, was hit by fragments of an Ariane-1 H-10 upper-stage booster which had exploded in November 1986. On 29 March 2006, the Russian Express-AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;"Notification for Express-AM11 satellite users in connection with the spacecraft failure" Russian Satellite Communications Company, 19 April 2006. its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.   In 1958, the United States launched Vanguard I into a medium Earth orbit (MEO). , it is the oldest surviving man-made space object still in orbit.Julian Smith, "Space Junk" USA Weekend, 26 August 2007.Vanguard 50 years In a catalog of known launches until July 2009, the Union of Concerned Scientists listed 902 operational satellites"UCS Satellite Database" Union of Concerned Scientists, 16 July 2009. from a known population of 19,000 large objects and about 30,000 objects launched. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union launched a number of naval surveillance satellites as part of their RORSAT (Radar Ocean Reconnaissance SATellite) program. The satellites were equipped with a BES-5 nuclear reactor to power their radar systems. Although the satellites were normally boosted into a medium-altitude graveyard orbit, several failures resulted in radioactive material reaching the ground or water. Satellites which have been disposed of have an estimated eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy,C. Wiedemann et al, "Size distribution of NaK droplets for MASTER-2009", Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Space Debris, 30 March-2 April 2009, (ESA SP-672, July 2009). forming additional debris.A. Rossi et al, "Effects of the RORSAT NaK Drops on the Long Term Evolution of the Space Debris Population", University of Pisa, 1997. These events continue to occur.  For example, in February 2015, the USAF Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Flight 13 (DMSP-F13) exploded on orbit, creating at least 149 debris objects, which are expected to remain in orbit for decades. According to Edward Tufte's book Envisioning Information, space debris includes a glove lost by astronaut Ed White on the first American space-walk (EVA); a camera lost by Michael Collins near Gemini 10; garbage bags jettisoned by Soviet cosmonauts during Mir's 15-year life, a wrench and a toothbrush. Sunita Williams of STS-116 lost a camera during an EVA. During an STS-120 EVA to reinforce a torn solar panel a pair of pliers was lost, and in an STS-126 EVA Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper lost a briefcase-sized tool bag.See image .  In characterizing the problem of space debris, it was learned that much debris was due to rocket upper stages (eg the Inertial Upper Stage) which end up in orbit, and break up due to decomposition of unvented unburned fuel. However, a major known impact event involved an (intact) Ariane booster. Although NASA and the United States Air Force now require upper-stage passivation, other launchers do not. Lower stages, like the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters or Apollo program's Saturn IB launch vehicles, do not reach orbit.Some return to Earth intact, see this list for examples. On 11 March 2000 a Chinese Long March 4 CBERS-1 upper stage exploded in orbit, creating a debris cloud.Phillip Anz-Meador and Mark Matney, "An assessment of the NASA explosion fragmentation model to 1&nbsp;mm characteristic sizes" Advances in Space Research, Volume 34 Issue 5 (2004), pp. 987 – 992."Debris from explosion of Chinese rocket detected by University of Chicago satellite instrument", University of Chicago press release, 10 August 2000.

Another Briz-M broke up on 16 October 2012 after a failed 6 August Proton-M launch. The amount and size of the debris was unknown. A past debris source was the testing of anti-satellite weapons (ASATs) by the U.S. and Soviet Union during the 1960s and 1970s. North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) files only contained data for Soviet tests, and debris from U.S. tests were only identified later.Note that the list Schefter was presented only identified USSR ASAT tests. By the time the debris problem was understood, widespread ASAT testing had ended; the U.S. Program 437 was shut down in 1975.Clayton Chun, "Shooting Down a Star: America's Thor Program 437, Nuclear ASAT, and Copycat Killers", Maxwell AFB Base, AL: Air University Press, 1999.

The missile was aimed to minimize the amount of debris, which (according to Pentagon Strategic Command chief Kevin Chilton) had decayed by early 2009.Jim Wolf, "US satellite shootdown debris said gone from space", Reuters, 27 February 2009. The vulnerability of satellites to debris and the possibility of attacking LEO satellites to create debris clouds, has triggered speculation that it is possible for countries unable to make a precision attack. An attack on a satellite of 10 tonnes or more would heavily damage the LEO environment. Although spacecraft are protected by Whipple shields, solar panels, which are exposed to the Sun, wear from low-mass impacts. These produce a cloud of plasma which is an electrical risk to the panels.Y. Akahoshi et al. "Influence of space debris impact on solar array under power generation." International Journal of Impact Engineering, Volume 35, Issue 12, December 2008, pp 1678–1682.

The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile propellant, but a battery explosion is also a possible cause. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 new objects. Kosmos 1484 broke up in a similar manner on 18 October 1993.Phillip Clark, "Space Debris Incidents Involving Soviet/Russian Launches", Molniya Space Consultancy, friends-partners.org.  Several impacts were confirmed since. Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993, and left adrift. On 24 July 1996, the French microsatellite Cerise was hit by fragments of an Ariane-1 H-10 upper-stage booster which exploded in November 1986. On 29 March 2006, the Russian Ekspress AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable; its engineers had sufficient time in contact with the spacecraft to send it to a parking orbit out of GEO.

On 22 January 2013 BLITS (a Russian laser-ranging satellite) was struck by debris suspected to be from the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test, changing its orbit and spin rate. In a Kessler syndrome, satellite lifetimes would be measured in years or months. New satellites could be launched through the debris field into higher orbits or placed in lower orbits (where decay removes the debris), but the utility of the region between  is the reason for its amount of debris.  Since the early Space Shuttle missions, NASA has used NORAD to monitor the Shuttle's orbital path for debris. In the '80s, this used much of its capacity. The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during STS-48 in September 1991,Rob Matson, "Satellite Encounters" Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page. a seven-second thruster burn to avoid debris from Kosmos 955."STS-48 Space Shuttle Mission Report", NASA, NASA-CR-193060, October 1991. Similar manoeuvres followed on missions 53, 72 and 82. One of the first events to publicize the debris problem occurred on Challenger's second flight, STS-7. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over  wide. On STS-59 in 1994, Endeavour's front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts have increased since 1998.Christiansen, E. L., J. L. Hydeb and R. P. Bernhard. "Space Shuttle debris and meteoroid impacts." Advances in Space Research, Volume 34 Issue 5 (May 2004), pp. 1097–1103.  Window chipping and minor damage to thermal protection system tiles (TPS) was already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle is now flown tail-first to take the debris load mostly on the engines and rear cargo bay (not used in orbit or during descent, and less critical for post-launch operation). When flying to the ISS, the two connected spacecraft are flipped around so the better-armored station shields the orbiter.  NASA's study concluded debris account for half of the overall risk to the Shuttle.Kelly, John. "Debris is Shuttle's Biggest Threat", space.com, 5 March 2005."Debris Danger." Aviation Week & Space Technology, Volume 169 Number 10 (15 September 2008), p. 18. Executive-level decision to proceed is required if catastrophic impact is likelier than 1 in 200. On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS the risk is ~1 in 300, but STS-125 (the Hubble repair mission) at  was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 risk (due to the 2009 satellite collision). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.William Harwood, "Improved odds ease NASA's concerns about space debris", CBS News, 16 April 2009.

Space debris groups resulting from satellite breakups are studied with scatter plots known as Gabbard diagrams. In a Gabbard diagram, the perigee and apogee of debris fragments resulting from a collision are plotted with respect to the orbital period of each fragment. Their distribution may indicate the direction and point of impact.David Portree and Joseph Loftus. "Orbital Debris: A Chronology", NASA, 1999, p. 13.David Whitlock, "History of On-Orbit Satellite Fragmentations", NASA JSC, 2004 Note: "Gabbard diagrams of the early debris cloud prior to the effects of perturbations, if the data were available, are reconstructed. These diagrams often include uncataloged as well as cataloged debris data. When used correctly, Gabbard diagrams can provide important insights into the features of the fragmentation." Manmade space debris has been dropping out of orbit at an average rate of about one object per day for the past 50 years. Variation in the average rate occurs as a result of the 11-year solar cycle, averaging almost three objects per day at solar maximum due to the heating (and thereby expansion) of the Earth's atmosphere. At solar minimum, usually five and one-half years later, the average is one about every three days. In addition to atmospheric effects on the natural decay of space debris, corporations, academics and government agencies have proposed plans and technology to deal with space debris. , most of the technological approaches have not become funded projects and there is no business plan extant to reduce the amount of space debris. In addition to technological approaches, a number of scholars have observed that institutional factors—political, legal, economic and cultural "rules of the game"—are the greatest impediment to the cleanup of near-Earth space.  There is no commercial incentive to reduce space debris, since its cost is not assigned to the entity producing it, but a number of suggestions have been made. A number of national and international factors affect the production and life of space debris.  There have been limited effects to date. In the United States, governmental bodies have been charged with backsliding on previous commitments to limit debris growth, "let alone tackling the more complex issues of removing orbital debris."     To reduce future space debris, the passivation of spent upper stages by the release of residual propellants aims to reduce the risk of orbital explosions generating additional debris. The modification of the Delta boosters eliminated their further contribution to the problem. Although there is no international treaty minimizing space debris, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) published voluntary guidelines in 2007."UN Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines", UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, 2010.

Retrieved from http://www.universetoday.com/101790/experts-urge-removal-of-space-debris-from-orbit/ One of the largest proposed satellite constellations to date—the OneWeb constellation with approximately 700 satellites on orbit after 2018—has explicitly stated that their satellites will be designed to comply with standard "orbital debris-mitigation guidelines for removing satellites from orbit and, for low-orbit satellites, assuring that they reenter the Earth’s atmosphere within 25 years of retirement."  The company has no plans for extraordinary measures beyond the standard "25-years" guideline, even though this one constellation alone will increase the number of active satellites on orbit by 25 percent. With a "one-up, one-down" launch-license policy for Earth orbits, launch-vehicle operators would pay for debris mitigation and rendezvous with, capture and de-orbit a derelict satellite from approximately the same orbital plane. Another possibility is the robotic refueling of satellites.Robotic refueling Mission Although the ITU requires geostationary satellites to move to a graveyard orbit at the end of their lives, the selected orbital areas do not sufficiently protect GEO lanes from debris. Rocket stages (or satellites) with enough propellant may power themselves into a decaying orbit. If a direct, controlled de-orbit would require too much propellant, a satellite may be brought to an orbit where atmospheric drag would cause it to eventually de-orbit. This was done with the French Spot-1 satellite, reducing its atmospheric re-entry time from a projected 200 years to about 15 by lowering its perigee from  to about .Luc Moliner, "Spot-1 Earth Observation Satellite Deorbitation", AIAA, 2002."Spacecraft: Spot 3", agi, 2003 Passive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed. Instead of rockets, an electrodynamic tether could be attached to a spacecraft at launch; at the end of its lifetime, the tether would be rolled out to slow the spacecraft.Bill Christensen, "The Terminator Tether Aims to Clean Up Low Earth Orbit", space.com.

Other proposals include a booster stage with a sail-like attachmentJonathan Amos, "How satellites could 'sail' home", BBC News, 3 May 2009.  and a large, thin, inflatable balloon envelope. A well-studied solution uses a remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with, capture and return debris to a central station.Erika Carlson et al, "Final design of a space debris removal system", NASA/CR-189976, 1990. One such system is Space Infrastructure Servicing, a commercially developed refueling depot and service spacecraft for communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit originally scheduled for a 2015 launch."Intelsat Picks MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. for Satellite Servicing", CNW Newswire, 15 March 2011.

The Advanced Common Evolved Stage family of upper stages is being designed with a high leftover-propellant margin (for derelict capture and de-orbit) and in-space refueling capability for the high Delta-v required to de-orbit heavy objects from geosynchronous orbit.Frank Zegler and Bernard Kutter, "Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture", AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition, 30 August-2 September 2010, AIAA 2010–8638. A tug-like satellite to drag debris to a safe altitude for it to burn up in the atmosphere has been researched.Schaub, H., Sternovsky, Z., (2013). "Active Space Debris Charging for Contactless Electrostatic Disposal". Advances in Space Research. 53(1), 110-118. http://dx.doi.org.esf.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/j.asr.2013.10.003. When debris is identified the satellite creates a difference in potential between the debris and itself, then using its thrusters to move itself and the debris to a safer orbit. A variation of this approach is for the remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with debris, capture it temporarily to attach a smaller de-orbit satellite and drag the debris with a tether to the desired location.  The "mothership" would then tow the debris-smallsat combination for atmospheric entry or move it to a graveyard orbit. One such system is the proposed Busek ORbital DEbris Remover (ORDER), which would carry over 40 SUL (Satellite on Umbilical Line) de-orbit satellites and propellant sufficient for their removal. The laser broom uses a ground-based laser to ablate the front of the debris, producing a rocket-like thrust which slows the object. With continued application, the debris would fall enough to be influenced by atmospheric drag.Jonathan Campbell, "Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection", Occasional Paper No. 20, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, December 2000. During the late 1990s, the U.S. Air Force's Project Orion was a laser-broom design.Ivan Bekey, "Project Orion: Orbital Debris Removal Using Ground-Based Sensors and Lasers.", Second European Conference on Space Debris, 1997, ESA-SP 393, p. 699. Although a test-bed device was scheduled to launch on a Space Shuttle in 2003, international agreements banning powerful laser testing in orbit limited its use to measurements.Justin Mullins "A clean sweep: NASA plans to carry out a spot of housework.", New Scientist, 16 August 2000. The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster postponed the project and according to Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist and program manager for NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, "There are lots of little gotchas in the Orion final report. There's a reason why it's been sitting on the shelf for more than a decade."Tony Reichhardt, "Satellite Smashers", Air & Space Magazine, 1 March 2008. The momentum of the laser-beam photons could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites. NASA research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of  per second, and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by  per day.James Mason et al, "Orbital Debris-Debris Collision Avoidance", arXiv:1103.1690v2, 9 March 2011. One drawback is the potential for material degradation; the energy may break up the debris, adding to the problem. A similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in Sun-synchronous orbit, using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry. A proposal to replace the laser with an Ion Beam Shepherd has been made,C. Bombardelli and J. Peláez, "Ion Beam Shepherd for Contactless Space Debris Removal".

In February 2012 the Swiss Space Center at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne announced the Clean Space One project, a nanosatellite demonstration project for matching orbit with a defunct Swiss nanosatellite, capturing it and de-orbiting together.  the cost of any of these solutions is about the same as launching a spacecraft and, according to NASA's Nicholas Johnson, not cost-effective. Since then Space Sweeper with Sling-Sat (4S), a grappling satellite which captures and ejects debris, has been studied.  A consensus of speakers at a meeting in Brussels on 30 October 2012 organized by the Secure World Foundation (a U.S. think tank) and the French International Relations Institute"Experts: Active Removal Key To Countering Space Junk Threat" Peter B. de Selding, Space.com 31 October 2012. reported that removal of the largest debris would be required to prevent the risk to spacecraft becoming unacceptable in the foreseeable future (without any addition to the inventory of dead spacecraft in LEO). Removal costs and legal questions about ownership and the authority to remove defunct satellites have stymied national or international action. Current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators, even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions. On 28 February 2014, Japan's JAXA program launched a test "space net" satellite. The launch was an operational test only.Roppolo, Michael. "Japan Launches Net Into Space to Help With Orbital Debris". CBS News. 28 February 2014 Since 2012, the European Space Agency has designed a mission to remove large space debris from orbit. The mission, e.Deorbit, is scheduled for launch by 2021 with an objective to remove debris heavier than  from LEO. Several capture techniques are being studied, including a net, a harpoon and a combination robot arm and clamping mechanism.Biesbroek, 2012 "Introduction to e.Deorbit". e.deorbit symposium. 6 May 2014   In 1946 during the Giacobinid meteor shower, Helmut Landsberg collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower.Fred Whipple, "The Theory of Micro-Meteorites, Part I: In an Isothermal Atmosphere", Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 36 Number 12 (15 December 1950), pp. 667 – 695. Fred Whipple was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the upper atmosphere. Instead, they quickly decelerated and then fell to Earth unmelted. In order to classify these sorts of objects, he coined the term "micro-meteorite".Fred Whipple, "The Theory of Micrometeorites.", Popular Astronomy, Volume 57, 1949, p. 517. Whipple, in collaboration with Fletcher Watson of the Harvard Observatory, led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen. At the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known. Direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors, demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from comet tails, and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin.Whipple, Fred. "A Comet Model. II. Physical Relations for Comets and Meteors", Astrophysical Journal, Volume 113 (1951), pp. 464–474. Today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the Solar System, consisting of particles from the interplanetary dust cloud or other objects made up from this material, like comets.D. E. Brownlee, D. A. Tomandl and E. Olszewski. "1977LPI.....8..145B Interplanetary dust: A new source of extraterrestrial material for laboratory studies", Proceedings of the 8th Lunar Scientific Conference, 1977, pp. 149–160. The early studies were based on optical measurements only. In 1957, Hans Pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the Earth, estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year.Hans Pettersson, "Cosmic Spherules and Meteoritic Dust." Scientific American, Volume 202 Issue 2 (February 1960), pp. 123–132. This suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations. Such a high flux presented a very serious risk to missions deeper in space, specifically the high-orbiting Apollo capsules. To determine whether the direct measurement was accurate, a number of additional studies followed, including the Pegasus satellite program. These showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere, or flux, was in line with the optical measurements, at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year.Andrew Snelling and David Rush, "Moon Dust and the Age of the Solar System" Creation Ex-Nihilo Technical Journal, Volume 7 Number 1 (1993), p. 2–42.   Whipple's work pre-dated the space race and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later. His studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote. However, a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites, about the size of dust grains. Whipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946. Originally known as a "meteor bumper" and now termed the Whipple shield, this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft's body. When a micrometeoroid strikes the foil, it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads. By the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft, it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below.Brian Marsden, "Professor Fred Whipple: Astronomer who developed the idea that comets are 'dirty snowballs'." The Independent, 13 November 2004. The shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity, while the foil adds little additional weight. Such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly. For spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit, some variety of the Whipple shield has been almost universal for decades.Fred Whipple, "Of Comets and Meteors" Science, Volume 289 Number 5480 (4 August 2000), p. 728.Judith Reustle (curator), "Shield Development: Basic Concepts", NASA HVIT. Retrieved 20 July 2011. Later research showed that ceramic fibre woven shields offer better protection to hypervelocity (~7&nbsp;km/s) particles than aluminium shields of equal weight.Ceramic Fabric Offers Space Age Protection, 1994 Hypervelocity Impact Symposium Another modern design uses multi-layer flexible fabric, as in NASA's design for its never-flown TransHab expandable space habitation module,Kim Dismukes (curator), "TransHab Concept", NASA, 27 June 2003. Retrieved 10 June 2007. and the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, which is currently finishing ground testing and is scheduled to be launched in 2015 to attach to the ISS for two years of orbital testing.  As space missions moved out from the Earth and into deep space, the question arose about the dangers posed by the asteroid belt environment, which probes would have to pass through on voyages to the outer solar system. Although Whipple had demonstrated that the near-Earth environment was not a problem for space travel, the same depth of analysis had not been applied to the belt. Starting in late 1968, Donald Kessler published a series of papers estimating the spatial density of asteroids.Donald Kessler, "Upper Limit on the Spatial Density of Asteroidal Debris" AIAA Journal, Volume 6 Number 12 (December 1968), p. 2450. The main outcome of this work was the demonstration that risks in transiting the asteroid belt could be mitigated, and the maximum possible flux was about the same as the flux in near-Earth space.Kessler 1971 A few years later, the Pioneer and Voyager missions demonstrated this to be true by successfully transiting this region. The evolution of the asteroid belt had been studied as a dynamic process since it was first considered by Ernst Öpik. Öpik's seminal paper considered the effect of gravitational influence of the planets on smaller objects, notably the Mars-crossing asteroids, noting that their expected lifetime was on the order of billions of years.Ernst Öpik, "Collision probabilities with the planets and the distribution of interplanetary matter", Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy of Sciences, Volume 54A (1951), pp. 165 – 199. A number of papers explored this work further, using elliptical orbits for all the objects and introducing a number of mathematical refinements.G. W. Wetherill, "Collisions in the Asteroid Belt", Journal of Geophysical Research, Volume 72 Number 9 (1967), pp. 2429–2444 Kessler used these methods to study Jupiter's moons, calculating expected lifetimes on the order of billions of years and demonstrating that several of the outer moons were almost certainly the result of recent collisions.Donald Kessler, "Derivation of the Collision Probability between Orbiting Objects: The Lifetimes of Jupiter's Outer Moons", Icarus, Volume 48 (1981), pp. 39 – 48. When the launch of Sputnik in 1957 began the Space Race, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) began compiling a database (the Space Object Catalog) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit: satellites, protective shields and upper- and lower-stage booster rockets. NASA published modified versions of the database in two-line element set,Felix Hoots, Paul Schumacher Jr. and Robert Glover, "History of Analytical Orbit Modeling in the U.S. Space Surveillance System." Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics, Volume 27 Issue 2, pp. 174 – 185. and during the early 1980s the CelesTrak bulletin board system re-published them.T.S. Kelso, CelesTrak BBS: Historical Archives, 2-line elements dating to 1980  The trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.Schefter, p. 48. Some were deliberately caused during 1960s anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modelling of orbital evolution and decay. When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler applied the technique developed for the asteroid-belt study to the database of known objects. In 1978 Kessler and Burton Cour-Palais co-authored "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt",Kessler 1978 demonstrating that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in LEO in decades rather than billions of years. They concluded that by about 2000, space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft.Kessler 2009 At the time, it was widely thought that drag from the upper atmosphere would de-orbit debris faster than it was created. However, Gabbard was aware that the number and type of objects in space were under-represented in the NORAD data and was familiar with its behaviour. In an interview shortly after the publication of Kessler's paper, Gabbard coined the term "Kessler syndrome" to refer to the accumulation of debris; it became widely used after its appearance in a 1982 Popular Science article,Schefter which won the Aviation-Space Writers Association 1982 National Journalism Award.  The lack of hard data about space debris prompted a series of studies to better characterize the LEO environment. In October 1979, NASA provided Kessler with funding for further studies. Several approaches were used by these studies. Optical telescopes or short-wavelength radar was used to measure the number and size of space objects, and these measurements demonstrated that the published population count was at least 50% too low.Kessler 1991, p. 65. Before this, it was believed that the NORAD database accounted for the majority of large objects in orbit. Some objects (typically, U.S. military spacecraft) were found to be omitted from the NORAD list, and others were not included because they were considered unimportant. The list could not easily account for objects under  in size—in particular, debris from exploding rocket stages and several 1960s anti-satellite tests. Returned spacecraft were microscopically examined for small impacts, and sections of Skylab and the Apollo Command/Service Module which were recovered were found to be pitted. Each study indicated that the debris flux was higher than expected and debris was the primary source of collisions in space. LEO already demonstrated the Kessler syndrome. In 1981 Kessler found that 42 percent of cataloged debris was the result of 19 events, primarily explosions of spent rocket stages (especially U.S. Delta rockets).Kessler 1981 He discovered this by using Gabbard's methods against known debris fields, overturning the previously held belief that most unknown debris was from old ASAT tests.Klinkrad, p. 2. A number of other Delta components in orbit (Delta was a workhorse of the U.S. space program) had not yet exploded. During the 1980s, the U.S. Air Force conducted an experimental program to determine what would happen if debris collided with satellites or other debris. The study demonstrated that the process differed from micrometeoroid collisions, with large chunks of debris created which would become collision threats. In 1991, Kessler published "Collisional cascading: The limits of population growth in low Earth orbit" with the best data then available. Citing the USAF conclusions about debris creation of debris, he wrote that although almost all debris objects (such as paint flecks) were lightweight, most of its mass was in debris about  or heavier. This mass could destroy a spacecraft on impact, creating more debris in the critical-mass area. According to the National Academy of Sciences: A 1-kg object impacting at 10&nbsp;km/s, for example, is probably capable of catastrophically breaking up a 1,000-kg spacecraft if it strikes a high-density element in the spacecraft. In such a breakup, numerous fragments larger than 1&nbsp;kg would be created.Technical, p. 4 Kessler's analysis divided the problem into three parts. With a low-enough density, the addition of debris by impacts is slower than their decay rate and the problem is not significant. Beyond that is a critical density, where additional debris leads to additional collisions. At densities beyond this critical mass production exceeds decay, leading to a cascading chain reaction reducing the orbiting population to small objects (several cm in size) and increasing the hazard of space activity. This chain reaction is known as the Kessler syndrome. In an early 2009 historical overview, Kessler summed up the situation: Aggressive space activities without adequate safeguards could significantly shorten the time between collisions and produce an intolerable hazard to future spacecraft. Some of the most environmentally dangerous activities in space include large constellations such as those initially proposed by the Strategic Defense Initiative in the mid-1980s, large structures such as those considered in the late-1970s for building solar power stations in Earth orbit, and anti-satellite warfare using systems tested by the USSR, the U.S., and China over the past 30 years. Such aggressive activities could set up a situation where a single satellite failure could lead to cascading failures of many satellites in a period much shorter than years. During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One effective solution was implemented by McDonnell Douglas on the Delta booster, by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated the pressure buildup in the tanks which caused them to explode in the past.Schefter, p. 50. Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the Soviet Union, the problem grew throughout the decade.See charts, Hoffman p. 7. A new battery of studies followed as NASA, NORAD and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter's article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000, new detectors in the Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit.See chart, Hoffman p. 4. By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects,In the time between writing Chapter 1 (earlier) and the Prolog (later) of Space Debris, Klinkrad changed the number from 8,500 to 13,000 – compare p. 6 and ix. and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an ASAT test and a satellite collision.Michael Hoffman, "It's getting crowded up there." Space News, 3 April 2009. In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked."Space Junk Threat Will Grow for Astronauts and Satellites", Fox News, 6 April 2011. The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler's 1991 derivation and 2001 updates,Kessler 2001 the LEO environment in the  altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major incident has occurred: the 2009 satellite collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem.Technical According to Kessler a cascade would not be obvious until it was well advanced, which might take years.Jan Stupl et al, "Debris-debris collision avoidance using medium power ground-based lasers", 2010 Beijing Orbital Debris Mitigation Workshop, 18–19 October 2010, see graph p. 4   A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own.Stefan Lovgren, "Space Junk Cleanup Needed, NASA Experts Warn."

Johnson, "Risks in Space from Orbiting Debris", Science, Volume 311 Number 5759 (20 January 2006), pp. 340 – 341 Richard Crowther of Britain's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015.Antony Milne, Sky Static: The Space Debris Crisis, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, ISBN 0-275-97749-8, p. 86. The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space—900 to  and —were already past  critical density.Technical, p. 7. In the 2009 European Air and Space Conference, University of Southampton researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. , more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.Paul Marks, "Space debris threat to future launches", 27 October 2009. A 2011 report by the U.S. National Research Council warned NASA that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris "has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures".
