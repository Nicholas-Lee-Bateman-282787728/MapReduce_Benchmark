     John Ellis "Jeb" Bush (born February 11, 1953) is an American businessman and politician who served as the 43rd Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007.  He is currently a candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Bush, who grew up in Houston, is the second son of former President George H. W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush, and a brother of former President George W. Bush. He graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and attended the University of Texas, where he earned a degree in Latin American affairs. In 1980, he moved to Florida and pursued a career in real estate development, and in 1986 became Florida's Secretary of Commerce until 1988.  At that time, he joined his father's successful campaign for the Presidency. In 1994, Bush made his first run for office, losing the election for governor by less than two percentage points to the incumbent Lawton Chiles. Bush ran again in 1998 and defeated Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay with 55 percent of the vote. He ran for reelection in 2002 and won with 56 percent to become Florida's first two-term Republican governor. During his eight years as governor, Bush pushed an ambitious Everglades conservation plan,Michael Grunwald, Jeb in the Wilderness: The time Florida's Republican governor took on the biggest environmental restoration project in American history, Politico Magazine (March/April 2015). supported caps for medical malpractice litigation, launched a Medicaid privatization pilot program, and instituted reforms to the state education system, including the issuance of vouchers and promoting school choice. Bush announced his presidential candidacy on June 15, 2015.Lee, M. J. "Donald Trump and Jeb Bush aren't on the same planet", CNN (October 9, 2015). Jeb Bush was born on February 11, 1953 in Midland, Texas. When he was six years old, the family relocated to the Tanglewood neighborhood of Houston, Texas.  The nickname "Jeb" is composed of his initials J.E.B. (John Ellis Bush). He grew up with two younger brothers, Neil and Marvin, one younger sister, Dorothy, and one older brother, George, who is seven years older.  Jeb Bush initially attended Grady Elementary School in Houston."Long-held values shape Public Life of Jeb Bush." The Miami Herald. September 22, 2002. Retrieved on October 15, 2012. "Bush attended public Grady Elementary School in Houston for several years[...]" Following in the footsteps of his father and older brother George, at the age of 14 years in late 1967, Bush began attending high school at the Andover, Massachusetts boarding school Phillips Academy, Andover. Even though he received poor grades at first, he made the honor roll by the end of his senior year and served as captain of the tennis team. At the age of 17, Bush taught English as a second language and assisted in the building of a school in Ibarrilla, a small village outside of León, Guanajuato, Mexico, as part of Andover's student exchange summer program. While in Mexico, he met his future wife, Columba Garnica Gallo. Bush, who had largely avoided criticizing or supporting the Vietnam War, registered for the draft after his graduation from high school in 1971. In the fourth and final draft lottery drawing, on February 2, 1972, for men born in 1953 and to be inducted during 1973, Bush received a draft number of 26 on a calendar-based scale that went to 365. But no new draft orders were issued after 1972, because the U.S. changed to an all-volunteer military beginning in 1973.Janowitz, Morris and Charles C. Moskos, Jr. “Five Years of the All-Volunteer Force: 1973-1978. Armed Forces & Society, Jan 1979; vol. 5: pp. 171–218. http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/2/171 Though many in his family had attended Yale University, Bush chose to attend the University of Texas at Austin, beginning in September 1971.  He played on the Texas Longhorns varsity tennis team in 1973.  He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude from the University of Texas at Austin with a B.A. in Latin American studies.http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/us/politics/jeb-bush-gives-party-something-to-think-about.html He completed his coursework in two and a half years.Kelley, Kitty.  The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty, p. 404 (Doubleday, 2004). In 1974, Bush went to work in an entry-level position in the international division of Texas Commerce Bank, which was founded by the family of James Baker. In November 1977, he was sent to Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, to open a new operation for the bank, where he served as branch manager and vice president. Following the 1980 presidential election, Bush and his family moved to Miami-Dade County, Florida.  He took a job in real estate with Armando Codina, a 32-year-old Cuban immigrant and self-made millionaire. Codina had made a fortune in a computer business, and then formed a new company, The Codina Group, to pursue opportunities in real estate.Zweigenhaft, Richard and Domhoff, G. William.  Diversity in the Power Elite: How it Happened, Why it Matters, p. 149 (Rowman & Littlefield 2006).  During his time with the company, Bush focused on finding tenants for commercial developments. Codina eventually made Bush his partner in a new development business, which quickly became one of South Florida's leading real estate development firms. As a partner, Bush received 40% of the firm's profits. In 1983, Bush said of his move from Houston to Miami: "On the personal side, my mother-in-law and sister-in-law were already living here", and on the professional side, "I want to be very wealthy, and I'll be glad to tell you when I've accomplished that goal."Morley, Jefferson.  "Dirty Money", Miami New Times (February 27, 1991). During Bush's years in Miami, he was involved in many different entrepreneurial pursuits, including working for a mobile phone company, serving on the board of a Norwegian-owned company that sold fire equipment to the Alaska oil pipeline, becoming a minority owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars, buying a shoe company that sold footwear in Panama, and getting involved in a project selling water pumps in Nigeria.Swasy, Alecia and Trigaux, Robert. "Make the Money and Run", St. Petersburg Times (September 20, 1998). Miguel Recarey, who ran International Medical Centres (IMC), employed Bush as a real estate consultant and paid him a 75,000 fee for finding the company a new location, although the move never took place. Bush did, however, lobby the Reagan administration vigorously and successfully on behalf of Recarey and IMC. Bush volunteered for his father's campaigns in 1980 and 1988. During the 1980 campaign, Bush worked as an unpaid volunteer, and expressed great admiration for his father. In the mid-1980s, Bush got his start in Florida politics as the Chairman of the Dade County Republican Party.Date, S.V. Jeb, p. 223 (Penguin, 2007). Dade County played an important role in the 1986 election of Bob Martinez to the Governor's office. In return, Martinez appointed Bush as Florida's Secretary of Commerce. He served in that role in 1987 and 1988, before resigning to work on his father's presidential campaign. Bush frequently communicated with his father's staff from 1981 through 1992. The younger Bush recommended Dexter Lehtinen for the post of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and set up a meeting between the Bush Administration and Motorola. He also advocated for Cuban exiles living in South Florida, and supported the Cuban embargo. In 1990, Bush urged his father to pardon Orlando Bosch, a Cuban exile who had been convicted of firing a rocket into a Polish ship which was on passage to Cuba. Bosch was released from prison and granted residency in the U.S.Campbell, Duncan "The Bush dynasty and the Cuban criminals." The Guardian (December 2, 2002). Retrieved September 9, 2010. In 1989, Bush was the campaign manager of Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American to serve in Congress.Adams, David and Simon, Stephanie.  "Jeb Bush: Party elder statesman or 2016 candidate?", Reuters (June 25, 2012). In 1994, Bush launched an unsuccessful bid for the Governor's office against incumbent Democratic Governor Lawton Chiles. Bush ran that year as a conservative. At one point, he was asked what he would do for African Americans, and Bush responded: "It’s time to strive for a society where there’s equality of opportunity, not equality of results. So I’m going to answer your question by saying: probably nothing."Aberbach, Joel and Peele, Gillian.  Crisis of Conservatism?: The Republican Party, the Conservative Movement, and American Politics After Bush, p. 189 (Oxford University Press, 2011). Bush lost the election by only 63,940 votes out of 4,206,076 that were cast for the major party candidates (2,135,008; 51% to 2,071,068; 49%). In the same election year, his older brother, George, was elected Governor of Texas. Following his election loss, Bush joined the board of the Heritage Foundation and continued to work with Codina Partners. Alongside T. William Fair, the president of the Urban League's Miami affiliate, Bush helped to establish Florida's first charter school. Bush ran again for governor in 1998, defeating Democrat Buddy MacKay, who was Lieutenant Governor. Bush ran for reelection in 2002 to become Florida's first two-term Republican governor. During his eight years as governor, Bush was credited with initiating environmental improvements, such as conservation in the Everglades, supporting caps for medical malpractice litigation, moving medicaid recipients to private systems, and instituting reforms to the state education system, including the issuance of vouchers and promoting school choice.  Bush was governor when his brother George won an intensely fought election recount in Florida to become President. Bush recused himself from any official role in the recount.Getter, Lisa. "Jeb Bush's Recount Role Examined." Los Angeles Times. July 14, 2001. Retrieved 2014-12-06.  In 1998, Bush defeated his Democratic opponent, Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay, by over 418,000 votes (2,191,105; 55% to 1,773,054; 45%) to become Governor of Florida. He campaigned as a "consensus-building pragmatist". Simultaneously, his brother, George W. Bush won a re-election victory for a second term as Governor of Texas, and they became the first siblings to govern two states simultaneously since Nelson and Winthrop Rockefeller governed New York and Arkansas from 1967 to 1971. In the 1998 election, Bush garnered 61 percent of the Hispanic vote and 14 percent of the African American vote. While governor, Bush presided over a state government that reduced taxes by 19 billion and he vetoed 2 billion in new spending, according to The Wall Street Journal. An analysis conducted by economist Martin Sullivan, which eliminated the effects of the federal estate tax repeal (which did not require legislative action to go into effect) and inflation, estimated the cumulative reduction in taxes by the state at closer to 13 billion during Bush's tenure, resulting in tax savings by 2006 of 140 per person, per year. A substantial amount of the tax savings in the higher estimate came from the phasing out of the federal estate tax law implemented in 2001 under President George W. Bush, for a total tax savings of 848 million per year; Jeb Bush did not push for a replacement with a state tax. The biggest reduction in taxes was due to the elimination of the state's Intangible Personal Property Tax, which applied to holdings of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and money market funds. During Bush's tenure, the state also increased its reserves from 1.3 billion to 9.8 billion, which coincided with Florida receiving the highest possible bond rating for the first time. According to Kurt Wenner, VP of research at Florida Tax Watch, Bush was governor during one of the strongest revenue periods for the state of Florida, due in part to the boom in property values, so that revenue grew despite the tax cuts he implemented. Bush reduced the state's government workforce by 11 percent.  In May 2006, as part of a 448.7-million line-item veto of state funding, he cut a total of 5.8 million in grants to public libraries, pilot projects for library homework help and web-based high-school texts, and funding for a joint-use library in Tampa. As Governor of Florida, Bush received grades of B in 2000, A in 2002, B in 2004, and C in 2006 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors. Bush's administration emphasized public education reform. His "A+ Plan" established heightened standards, required testing of all students, and graded all Florida schools.  From 1998 to 2005, reading scores of 4th grade students in Florida on the National Assessment of Educational Progress increased 11 points, compared to 2.5 points nationally, according to the Maine Heritage Policy Center, a conservative think tank which opposes standardized testing. Bush has been a proponent of school vouchers and charter schools, especially in areas of the state with failing public schools, although to date very few schools have received failing grades from the state. He established the McKay Scholarship Program which provides vouchers for students with learning disabilities to attend a school of their choice.  He also established the A+ Opportunity Scholarship Program which provided vouchers to students.  This program was struck down by the Florida Supreme Court in 2006.Thomas, Robert.  God in the Classroom: Religion and America's Public Schools, p. 167 (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007). Bush helped create the Corporate Income Tax Credit Scholarship which provides corporations with tax credits for donations to Scholarship Funding Organizations.  Those organizations must spend 100% of the donations on scholarships for low income students. Bush declined to raise taxes for education, which led him to oppose a ballot initiative to amend the Florida Constitution so as to cap growing school class sizes. Bush said he had "a couple of devious plans if this thing passes". Despite his opposition, the amendment passed. In higher education, Bush approved three new medical schools during his tenure and also put forth the "One Florida" proposal, an initiative that had the effect of ending affirmative action admissions programs at state universities.James, Joni. Jeb Bush on One Florida, St. Petersburg Times, March 18, 2007. Retrieved June 14, 2008. These moves were among the concerns that led to the faculty of the University of Florida to deny Bush an honorary degree, while the University of Florida Alumni Association made him an honorary alumnus. As Governor, Bush proposed and passed into law major reform to the medical liability system. The Florida Senate, a majority of which were Republican, opposed Bush's proposed caps on non-economic damages for injury and wrongful death. Bush insisted, and called the legislature into five special sessions. The contentious debate even included a senior Bush staffer calling for primary opposition to Republicans who disagreed with the Governor on the reforms. Eventually, the legislature agreed to the caps and Bush's reforms passed. In 2014, after Bush left office, the Florida Supreme Court ruled the damage cap - the "centerpiece" of the 2003 legislation that Bush had pushed for - to be a violation of the state Constitution's equal protection clause, discriminating against "those who are most grievously injured, those who sustain the greatest damage and loss, and multiple claimants."Mary Ellen Klas, Fla. Supreme Court rejects damage caps on medical malpractice, Miami Herald (March 13, 2014). Bush passed a reform to Florida's Medicaid system that moved recipients into private managed care systems. Bush was involved in the Terri Schiavo case, involving a woman with massive brain damage, who was on a feeding tube for over 15 years, and whose husband and legal guardian, Michael Schiavo, wished to remove the tube. This move was opposed by Terri Schiavo's parents in the courts. Bush signed "Terri's Law", legislation passed by the Florida legislature that authorized him, as Governor, to keep Schiavo on life support.[ ] Florida Governor Jeb Bush intervenes in "right-to-die" case: A cruel pandering to the religious right, October 31, 2003, Joseph Kay[ ]"Eventually, Jeb Bush Will Need to Claim He’s the Conservative Candidate" National Review Online Jim Geraghty December 3, 2014 The law was ruled unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court on September 23, 2004.

He also set aside over one million acres of land for conservation as part of a land purchase program.Chapin, Timothy et al.  Growth Management in Florida: Planning for Paradise, p. 246 (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012). In 2001, Bush eliminated civil service protection for over 16,000 state jobs, which had the effect of making it easier to fire employees in those positions.  In addition, he issued an executive order which removed racial preferences in state contracting. In 2004, Bush supported an unsuccessful bill to allow illegal immigrants to be issued drivers licenses by the state. Bush supported more than a dozen new protections for gun owners.  In 2005, Bush signed into law Florida's stand-your-ground law, which was the first such state law in the United States. Bush is an advocate of capital punishment and 21 prisoners were executed during his term. After the execution of Ángel Nieves Díaz was seemingly botched –  the execution took 37 minutes to complete, and required a second injection of the lethal chemicals – he suspended all executions in Florida on December 15, 2006. During Bush's tenure, the racial and gender diversity of the state's judicial bench increased.  However, according to the Wall Street Journal, Democrats criticized some of Bush's judicial appointments as being "overtly partisan and political". Bush often used the line-item veto to limit state spending.Gillin, Joshua.  “PolitiFact Florida: When Jeb Bush was known as ‘Veto Corleone’”, Miami Herald (May 30, 2015).Crew, Robert.  Jeb Bush: Aggressive Conservatism in Florida, p. 48 (University Press of America, 2009).  He exercised his veto to stop other legislation as well (such as a bill about "parenting coordinators"). In 1995, the Florida state legislature created the High Speed Rail Authority (HSRA) and came up with a public-private partnership model. Government would build the system leveraging state dollars with federal funds and tax-free bonding. The private sector was to invest money in the project, help design and build the network, and be given the franchise to operate the trains–known as Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM). Trains would be privately owned, similar to how the airline industry operates in a publicly financed airport.Florida High Speed Rail – Overview. Florida Bullet Train.org. Retrieved on November 9, 2010.  The rail system and its planning was estimated to cost 7–8 billion. On January 14, 1999, Bush announced that the venture posed too much risk and too much cost for Florida taxpayers and that further funding would be halted. In response, Florida businessman C.C. (Doc) Dockery, the former chairman of the Florida High Speed Rail Commission, authored a constitutional amendment that was added to the Florida ballot in 2000. The amendment was approved by voters. The amendment directed Bush and the Florida legislature to start building a high speed monorail, fixed guide way, or magnetic levitation system linking Florida's five largest urban areas by 2003. Bush vetoed funding for the project and led a high-profile campaign to amend the Florida constitution to repeal the 2000 constitutional amendment that mandated the construction of the high-speed system. In 2004, voters approved that amendment to repeal the 2000 high-speed rail amendment.  Bush was unopposed in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary, and in the general election he faced Democratic challenger Bill McBride.  They met for two debates, in the most expensive Florida gubernatorial election yet. Voting went smoothly.  Bush defeated McBride 56% to 43%, a greater margin of victory than in 1998. Bush won 44 percent of the state's Jewish vote in the 2002 race.Stewart, Russ. Will Iraqi Victory convert Jews to GOP?, Russ Stewart, April 16, 2003. Retrieved June 14, 2008. Bush also won the white female vote in the swing-voting battleground of Central Florida's I-4 corridor. However, he was not able to replicate the same success with African American voters (like he had earlier in 1998), winning only 8 percent of the African American vote.  He became the first Republican governor of Florida to win re-election. According to political scientist Susan MacManus from the University of South Florida, "In Florida, [Bush is] still perceived as conservative, especially on fiscal issues and even on social issues." Outside of Florida, fellow Republican leaders throughout the country have sought Bush's aid both on and off the campaign trail. Bush's out-of-state campaign visits include Kentucky, where Republican challenger Ernie Fletcher appeared with Bush and won that state's governorship in 2003, ending a 32-year streak of Democratic governors.  In the first few months of 2014, Bush campaigned for New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), and David Jolly who won a special congressional election in Florida.Rucker, Philip and Costa, Robert.  “Influential Republicans working to draft Jeb Bush into 2016 presidential race”, The Washington Post (March 29, 2014). Bush has been criticized by some in the Tea Party as not being sufficiently conservative, as he supports positions on immigration and Common Core that are unpopular with some conservatives.Collinson, Stephen and Reston, Maeve (January 28, 2015) – "Jeb Bush's Conservative Evolution". CNN. Retrieved January 28, 2015.  Bush publicly criticized the national Republican party for its adherence to "an orthodoxy that doesn't allow for disagreement" on June 11, 2012. In comments shared with Bloomberg View, Bush suggested that former Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush would "have had a hard time" finding support in the contemporary GOP. In October 2013, Bush called for passage of immigration reform.  In April 2014, Bush said of illegal immigration: "It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family. I honestly think that that is a different kind of crime. There should be a price paid, but it shouldn't rile people up that people are actually coming to this country to provide for their families." From 2004 to 2007, Bush served as a Board Member for the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). Created by Congress, the board's purpose is to establish policy on reports examining K-12 students' academic progress in America's public and private schools. Since then Bush's education foundation has advocated for the Common Core State Standards Initiative. In October 2013, referring to opponents of the standards, Bush said that while "criticisms and conspiracy theories are easy attention grabbers", he instead wanted to hear their solutions to the problems in American education. In May 2006, Bush was approached to become the next commissioner of the National Football League.  The outgoing commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, was searching for replacements. In response, Bush said on May 24, 2006 that "I'm Governor of the state of Florida and I intend to be Governor until I leave—which is January 2007." Roger Goodell eventually became the new NFL commissioner. In April 2013, Bush authored a cover story for Newsmax magazine, warning that America's entitlement system risked collapse unless there was a course correction in U.S. public policy. Bush touted a six-point plan that addressed taxes, education, immigration, energy, regulatory policy, and the family unit.  According to Fox Business, Bush earned nearly half of the 29 million he earned between 2007 and when he decided to run for Republican presidential nomination in December 2014, from Wall Street banks and companies. In April 2007, Bush joined Tenet Healthcare's board of directors.Koenig, David. Jeb Bush joins Tenet Healthcare's board, USA Today, May 10, 2007. Retrieved June 14, 2008. The following August, Bush joined investment bank, Lehman Brothers, as an adviser in its private equity group. Bush has also served on the board of InnoVida, Swisher Hygiene, and Rayonier and has served as an adviser to Barclays. Bush would later return 270,000 in consultancy fees he had been paid by InnoVida after they declared bankruptcy. As of 2014, Bush had received more than 2 million from his work for Tenet, a company that expected to receive 100 million in new earnings in 2014 because of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and that "aggressively encouraged Americans to sign up for insurance under the program...."  Bush has reportedly objected to the ACA at company meetings, but has kept his personal views separate from what is best for Tenet.   Bush has been considered a potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election since the end of the 2012 election. At a press conference on April 16, 2013, at Bluefield College, Bush stated he had not begun the decision making process about a run but that he would begin to consider a run soon. On October 2, 2014, George W. Bush said that his brother "wants to be President".Kendall Breitman, George W. Bush: I think Jeb wants it. Politico, 10/2/14. On December 16, 2014, Bush announced via Facebook that he would be "actively exploring"  a 2016 run to become President of the United States and at the end of the year resigned several corporate boards. In February 2015, Bush released several thousand emails from his time as Governor online. Most of the emails are in the public record under Florida's Sunshine Laws. However, Bush created controversy by releasing some emails that included some personal details such as social security numbers, names and addresses, as well as the contents of the messages.Jeb Bush camp blames Florida for unredacted emails Kendall Breitman, Politico,  February 10, 2015  Bush's campaign team subsequently redacted the personal information. By extending the exploration mode of his potential candidacy to a six-month period (his scheduled announcement came one day short of six months into his exploratory phase), Bush used his time to get acquainted with the press, court donors, and prepare strategy. In doing this, he navigated several campaign finance laws which limit donations and prohibit coordination with Super PACs.Frumin, Aliyah.

David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute, said: "It’s pretty hard for [Republicans] to win the White House if current Hispanic voting trends continue. (Bush) has some unique abilities to appeal to those voters and he’s going to maximize them.”   Bush has addressed a myriad of political issues over the course of his career, many of them during his governorship as already described.  In conjunction with his 2015 bid for the presidency, he has revisited many issues that he addressed before, as well as discussing many new ones. Bush believes abortions should only be legal in the case of rape or incest or if the life of the mother is in danger. He does not support public funding for abortion clinics. Bush has questioned the scientific opinion on climate change, while stating "I think global warming may be real", and "It is not unanimous among scientists that it is disproportionately manmade. What I get a little tired of on the left is this idea that somehow science has decided all this so you can't have a view." National Journal wrote that Bush "does not acknowledge the scientific consensus that human activity drives climate change".Clare Foran, Jeb Bush is All Over the Place on Climate Change: The 2016 hopeful is "concerned" about global warming. Will he do anything to fight it?, National Journal (May 22, 2015). Bush supports offshore drilling outside of Florida.  He says that he supports the Keystone XL oil pipeline as well as fracking. According to his spokeswoman, "As governor he worked to strike a balance between our nation's energy needs and the economic and environmental interests of Florida. He believes states should have a role in decisions that impact their coastline. Expanding domestic energy production is key to ensuring America's energy security." Bush favors repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or "Obamacare") and replacing it with a "market-oriented" alternative.Igor Bobic, Jeb Bush: Replace 'Monstrosity' of Obamacare, Huffington Post (March 8, 2015). Bush has called the current law a "monstrosity" that is "flawed to its core."Bill Glauber, Obamacare is flawed, Jeb Bush says at Milwaukee event, Journal Sentinel (November 4, 2015). Bush has proposed some sort of state- or local-government funded "catastrophic coverage" system, in which "if you have a hardship that goes way beyond your means of paying for it, ... the government is there or an entity is there to help you deal with that."

Burwell in June 2015, Bush stated that the decision was "not the end of the fight" against the law.Jeb: Ruling is 'not the end of the fight' against ObamaCare, The Hill (June 29, 2015). In 2015, Bush took the position that people in the United States illegally should have a path to legal status, but not a path to citizenship,  and said that legal status and avoiding deportation should require immigrants to pay fines, get work permits, pay taxes, not receive government assistance, learn English, and not commit crimes.
