As it was twenty-six boroughs were in the county from January 23, 1894, to December 18, of the same year." The main impetus for the break from Ridgewood Township was the decision to have Glen Rock students attend a new school closer to the center of Ridgewood instead of their one-room schoolhouse located at the intersection of Ackerman Avenue and Rock Road. Glen Rock was settled around a large boulder in a small valley (glen), from which it gets its name.Hutchinson, Viola L.

Called Pamachapura, or Stone from Heaven, by the Delaware (Lenape) Indians, it served as a base for Indian signal fires and later as a trail marker for colonists."Elder, Janet.

The borough was the site of one of Bergen County's most serious public transportation accidents.  In 1911, a trolley operator for the North Jersey Rapid Transit Company, one day away from retirement, died in a crash with an opposing trolley around the intersection of Prospect and Grove Streets that was caused by signal problems.  In addition to the death of the opposing trolley operator, 12 people were injured.  This crash in part hastened the demise of this transportation mode which ran from Elmwood Park, New Jersey to Suffern, New York and competed with the Erie Railroad. The right of way for this trolley line was purchased by the Public Service Enterprise Group and is still visible today.Smith, Jr., Don E.
