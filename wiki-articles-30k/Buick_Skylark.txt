 The Buick Skylark is a passenger car produced by Buick. The model was made in six production runs, during 46 years, over which the car's design varied dramatically due to changing technology, tastes, and new standards implemented over the years. Created to mark Buick's 50th anniversary, the Roadmaster Skylark joined the Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta and Cadillac Series 62 Eldorado as top-of-the-line, limited-production specialty convertibles introduced in 1953 by General Motors to promote its design leadership. Of the three, the Skylark's run of 1,690 units proved the most successful, and an amazing sales feat considering the car's 1953 list price of slightly in excess of US$5,000 was almost 50% more than the well-equipped US$3,200 Roadmaster convertible it was based on. Nevertheless, many languished in dealer showrooms and were eventually sold at discount. Production ran for two years. Based on the model 76R two-door Roadmaster convertible, the 1953 Skylark  (designated model 76X) had identical dimensions (except height), almost identical appearance, shared its drive train, and had all its standard equipment &emdash; plus its few remaining options, including power windows, power brakes, full carpeting, and a "Selectronic" AM radio.OldCarBrochures.com Only A/C wasn't offered, unnecessary in either convertible. Importantly, the new Skylark featured Buick's new 322&nbsp;in³ (5.3&nbsp;L) Nailhead V8 in place of the autotmaker's longstanding straight 8, and a 12&nbsp;volt electrical system, both division firsts.  It debuted full-cutout wheel openings, a styling cue that spread to the main 1954 Buick line. Accenting its lowered, notched beltline was a new "Sweepspear" running almost the entire length of the vehicle, a styling cue that was to appear in various forms on many Buick models over the years. The 1953 Skylark was handmade in many respects. Only stampings for the hood, trunk lid and a portion of the convertible tub were shared with the Roadmaster and Super convertibles. All Skylark tubs were finished with various amounts of lead filler. The inner doors were made by cutting the 2-door Roadmaster's in two then welding the pieces back together at an angle to produce the rakish door dip. An overall more streamlined look was reinforced by cutting the windshield almost  shorter and lowering the side windows and convertible top frame proportionately. Seat frames and steering column were then dropped to provide proper headroom and driving position. Front leg room was . Authentic wire wheels were produced by Kelsey-Hayes, chromed everywhere except the plated and painted "Skylark" center emblem. The Skylark returned in 1954 with radically restyled styling unique to the Buick line, which included wheel cutouts that could be painted in a contrasting color to the body's. The trunk was sloped into a semi-barrel, and tail lights moved to large chromed fins projecting atop the rear fenders. Re-designated model 100, the car was based on the all-new shorter Century/Special series 40 chassis and not the larger series 60 Roadmaster/Super chassis, also all-new for 1954. Once again, all Skylarks were built as two-door convertibles and carried the same luxury equipment as before, but front leg room dropped . While smaller and lighter, the Skylark got a performance boost by retaining the big Buicks' powertrain, an evolutionary improvement of 1953's with the highest output in the division's lineup. The 1954 Skylark once again had unique sheetmetal stampings for its elongated wheel cutouts and new semi-barrel trunk, though fabrication was done without hand labor. The hood ornament was unique, adopted the following year across the Buick product line. Sales proved to be poor, reflecting the Skylark's continued high price coupled with a perceived step-down from the Roadmaster/Super series, slumping far enough to cause the model's cancellation at the end of the 1954 model year. 200px" heights="150px 1953 Buick Roadmaster Skylark Series 70 1954 Buick Roadmaster Skylark Series 100 convertible   In the fall of 1960, General Motors introduced a trio of new compact cars for the 1961 model year that shared the same chassis, engines, and basic sheet metal: the Buick Special, Pontiac Tempest, and Oldsmobile F-85. The Special's styling was strongly influenced by the new corporate look shared with the larger LeSabre, Invicta, and Electra also introduced in 1961. In the middle of the 1961 model year the Buick Special Skylark made its debut.  Effectively a luxury trim level, it was based on two-door sedan (also referred to as a coupe),Hemmings.com  1964–1965 Buick Skylark - Retrieved on 07/01/2013 it featured unique Skylark emblems, taillight housings, lower-body side moldings, turbine wheel covers, and a vinyl-covered roof. 1961 Skylarks featured three Ventiports on each fender. A plush all-vinyl interior was standard, with bucket seats available as an option. Instrumentation was minimal, consisting of only a speedometer and  fuel gauge. The Skylark replaced the Special's standard aluminum block  2-barrel carburetor V8 with a higher compression ratio 4-barrel version that boosted power from  at 4600&nbsp;rpm to . For the 1962 model year, the  Skylark became a model in its own right. It used the previous year's basic sheet metal but was available in two new body styles: a two-door convertible coupe (shared with the Special and Special Deluxe models) and a two-door (pillarless) hardtop unique to it. Tuning of the 215-cubic-inch V8 increased power to  at 4800&nbsp;rpm. In 1962, the Skylark Special was also the first American car to use a V6 engine in volume production; it earned Motor Trends Car of the Year for 1962.Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. American Cars 1960-1972 (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.142. This 198&nbsp;cid Fireball was engineered down from the 215 and used many of the same design parameters, but was cast in iron. Output was 135&nbsp;hp (gross) at 4600&nbsp;rpm and  at 2400&nbsp;rpm. In their test that year, Road & Track was impressed with Buick's "practical" new V6, saying it "sounds and performs exactly like the aluminum V8 in most respects." In 1963, the Special's body was restyled and minor changes made to the interior, particularly to the dash and instrument cluster. The 1963 Special was available as a 2-door pillared hardtop coupe, a four dour sedan, a convertible, and a station wagon. Engine choices were a standard  V6 with a twin-barrel carburetor and an optional  V8 with  (two-barrel) or more powerful four-barrel ( in 1962,  in 1963).Flory (2004), pp.143 & 205. Transmission choices were a 'three on the tree' manual transmission, a floor shift Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed manual, or a two-speed Turbine Drive automatic. The two speed "Dual Path Turbine Drive" automatic was a Buick design and shared no common parts with the better known Chevrolet Power-Glide transmission. Two prototypes were made for 1962, each with a unique body. One a convertible and the other a hardtop. The prototypes came directly from Buick Engineering, both had been given two 4-barrel carburetors by the engineers thus increasing the prototype's horsepower a little more than 80&nbsp;hp. Of note was that they had features from the '61, '62, and the '63 production models. Some features, such as the two 4-barrel carburetors, were left out of the production-line Skylarks. The prototypes were also were  longer, and wider than the production models. Of the two prototypes, only the hardtop still exists and resides with its owner in Michigan. It is possible the convertible prototype still exists in the Sloan Museum collection.  The 1963 Skylarks used the same chassis and wheelbase as the previous 1961 and 1962 models, but adopted new sheet metal that featured boxier styling. Length was increased by  to , and the 215-cubic-inch V8 generated  at 5000&nbsp;rpm. The 1963 Skylark was available as a two-door convertible coupe or a two-door (pillarless) hardtop coupe. The 1963 Special shared most sheet metal with the Skylark, but was available as a 2-door pillared hard top, four-dour sedan, convertible, and station wagon. Engine choices included a  V6 with 2-barrel carburetor, the  V8 with two-barrel or a 4-barrel carburetor. Transmission choices were a 'three on the tree' manual transmission, a floor-shifted Borg-Warner T-10 4-speed manual, or a two-speed automatic. The two-speed "Dual Path Turbine Drive" automatic was a Buick design and shared no common parts with the Chevrolet Power-Glide transmission. Instrument panel padding and a cigarette lighter was standard.OldCarBrochures.comHagerty.com  History of the 1961–1963 Buick Skylark - Retrieved on 07/22/2013    Beginning with the 1964 model year, the dressed-up compact had enough sales to merit its own separate line, the Buick Skylark. Along with the lower-priced Special from which it was derived, the Skylark would move to a new intermediate-size chassis that was shared with the Oldsmobile F-85, Pontiac Tempest, and the new Chevrolet Chevelle. The new chassis had a wheelbase of  and the Buick Special and Skylark had a length of . The 215-cubic-inch-displacement, aluminum-block V8 engine was discontinued, and the associated tooling eventually was sold to the British manufacturer, Rover. That company would produce the engine in several versions for use in its sedans and Land Rover sport utility vehicles and trucks. The standard Skylark engine was now a , all-cast-iron-block V6 with a Rochester 1-barrel carburetor that generated  at 4400&nbsp;rpm. This engine was introduced in 1964, very similar to the earlier V6 beginning with the 1962 model year which had a smaller displacement of . This engine was basically a Buick V8 300 CID engine, but the block was cast with two less cylinders. The optional engine was a 300-cubic-inch, cast-iron-block and aluminum-heads V8 with a Rochester 2-barrel carburetor that generated  at 4600&nbsp;rpm. An optional V8 version of the 300 CID engine was offered with an 11:1 compression and a 4-barrel carburetor generating . A long-throw, 4-speed Hurst shifter was available. For the 1965 model, cast-iron blocks and heads were used for all engines. In addition to the two-door convertible and hardtop coupe body-styles, a Skylark four-door sedan became available for the first time. Skylarks, however, would continue to have higher levels of exterior and interior trim compared to the Special and Special Deluxe from which they were derived. All-vinyl bucket seats would be standard on the convertible and optional on the hardtop coupe. The sedan would come with cloth-and-vinyl seats standard, and an all-vinyl interior would be optional. The Sylark Coupe had a lower profile, sitting lower to the road than the Buick Special models. Buick's traditional styling feature called VentiPorts were integrated into the front half rub strip that ran the entire length of the vehicle, with later versions appearing vertically stacked in a similar implementation on the Buick Wildcat. The Skylark in 1964–1965 was available in a pillar-less coupe (hardtop) two-door version, as the Specials and Special Deluxes only came in pillared coupe versions. Beginning with the 1964 model year, a two-door sedan (pillared coupe) was added to the Skylark lineup. Inspired in no small part by the sales success of the 1964 Pontiac Tempest, LeMans, and GTO, the Gran Sport option became available in mid 1965 offered as a coupe, hardtop or convertible.Hagerty.com  History of the 1964–1967 Buick Skylark - Retrieved on 07/22/2013 The Gran Sport featured Buick’s 401-cubic-inch-displacement V8 engine using a Carter 4-barrel carburetor that produced  at 4400&nbsp;rpm (it was listed as 400-cubic-inch in sales literature, supposedly to escape a General Motors mandate that engines larger than 400 cubic inches should not be used in intermediate-sized cars). Other Gran Sport features were unique Gran Sport badging, a heavy-duty radiator, and dual exhaust. In the 1966 model year, the four-door (pillared) sedan was replaced by a four-door (pillarless) hardtop sedan. The convertible, hardtop coupe, and two-door sedan continued to be available. The 1966 two-door Skylark was available with the optional "Wildcat 375", 340 ci engine which produced  and . torque with a 4-barrel Carter carb.  The four-door sedan would rejoin the lineup for the 1967 model year, making a total of five Skylark body styles. Beginning with the 1967 model year, only the Skylark two-door sedan would be available with the Buick V6 engine as standard. The 300-cubic-inch V8 would be standard on all other models, with the exception of the four-door hardtop sedan, which came with a 340-cubic-inch-displacement V8 engine using a Rochester 2-barrel carburetor and producing  at 4400&nbsp;rpm. The previous Buick Skylark Gran Sport was relabeled as the Buick Skylark Gran Sport 400 to reflect its engine. The new model was the Buick Skylark Gran Sport 340, which also used the 340-cubic-inch V8 that was standard on the Skylark four-door hardtop. The Gran Sport 340 was available only as a two-door hardtop coupe.   The 1968 model year was one of significant change for the Buick Skylark.Hagerty.com History of the 1968–1972 Buick Skylark - Retrieved on 07/22/2013 Although still using the same basic chassis, all of GM’s mid-sized cars adopted a policy of using two different length wheelbases. Two-door models used a shorter wheelbase of , while four-door models used a longer wheelbase of 116&nbsp;in (the Buick Sport Wagon and Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser used an even longer wheelbase of 121&nbsp;in). All of GM's mid-sized cars received all-new sheet metal.  Federally mandated safety features improved occupant protection and accident avoidance starting with the 1967s. The Buick Gran Sport, previously an option package available on the Skylark, became a separate series, starting with the 340&nbsp;hp/440&nbsp;lbs torque 400 c.i.d. V8 1968 GS 400, using the 2 door Skylark body and chassis. In a reshuffling of models in the lineup, the Special Deluxe replaced the previous Special. The Skylark nameplate was shuffled down a notch to replace the previous Special Deluxe. The previous Skylark was replaced by a new Skylark Custom. The basic Skylark was available as a two-door hardtop coupe or a four-door sedan. The Skylark Custom came as a two-door convertible coupe, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, or four-door sedan. The previous V6 was discontinued and the associated tooling was sold to Kaiser Industries, which used the V6 in its Jeep trucks and sport utility vehicles. The base engine in Buick Skylarks (and Buick Special sedans) became a 250-cubic-inch inline six-cylinder engine using a 1-barrel Rochester carburetor (borrowed from Buick’s sister Chevrolet division) that produced  at 4200&nbsp;rpm. Optional on the Skylark and standard on the Skylark Custom was a new 350-cubic-inch V8 engine using a 2-barrel Rochester carburetor that produced  at 4400&nbsp;rpm. This engine was based on the previous 300- and 340-cubic&nbsp;inch-displacement V8 engines. The Buick Special name was dropped after the 1969 model year.  A locking steering column with a new, rectangular ignition key became standard on all 1969 GM cars (except Corvair), one year ahead of the Federal requirement.  For 1970, the mid-sized Buicks once again received new sheet metal and the Buick Skylark name was moved down another notch, replacing the previous Buick Special. The Skylark became the entry-level Buick available in two- and four-door sedans with the 250-cubic-inch inline-6 as standard and the 350-cubic-inch V8 (260 horsepower at 4600&nbsp;rpm) available as an option.  Interestingly, the two-door models shared their roofline with the 1970 Chevelle, as opposed to the Pontiac LeMans and Oldsmobile Cutlass, which shared a different roof design.  The two-door sedan body style was unique to Buick; it had the same swoopy roofline as the hardtop but with a thick "B" pillar, with Buick's traditional styling feature called the "Sweepspear" appearing as a crease that ran the length of the vehicle. Chevrolet did not offer a pillared coupe for the Chevelle from 1970 to 1972; all two-doors were hardtops. Replacing the previous Buick Skylark was the Buick Skylark 350, available as a two-door hardtop coupe or four-door sedan with the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment. This 350-cubic-inch engine was a different design than the Chevy's 350 CID engine (4.000&nbsp;in × 3.48&nbsp;in) the Buick design had a longer stroke and smaller bore (3.80 X 3.85&nbsp;in) allowing for lower-end torque, deep-skirt block construction, higher nickel-content cast iron,  crank main journals, and  connecting rods, the distributor was located in front of the engine (typical of Buick), the oil pump was external and mounted in the front of the engine, the rocker arm assembly had all rocker arms mounted on a single rod and were not adjustable. The Skylark Custom continued to be available, also using the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and still available as a two-door convertible coupe, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, and four-door sedan. Buick Gran Sport models continued to be available as a separate series. The Buick Sport Wagon name was now used on a conventional four-door station wagon that no longer featured a raised roof with glass panels over the cargo area, or a longer wheelbase, as in the past. It now used the same  wheelbase as the Buick Skylark four-door sedan and the now-discontinued Buick Special four-door Station Wagon. It became, in effect, a Buick Skylark four-door station wagon in all respects but the name. .  For the 1971 model year, the base Skylark was available only with the inline-6, now only putting out  due to emission control devices, but in a two-door hardtop coupe body-style (in addition to the previous two- and four-door sedans). The Skylark 350 had a V8 engine that put out only . It was now available as a two-door sedan in addition to the previous two-door hardtop coupe and four-door sedan. 1972 was the last model year for the mid-sized Buick Skylark. During this model year many pollution controls were added to the Engines, Compression was lowered, engines had to accept leaded and unleaded gas, and spark timing was retarded (no vacuum advance in lower gears) while driving in lower gears to reduce emissions. For 1972, the base Buick Skylark used the 350-cubic-inch V8 with the 2-barrel Rochester carburetor (now putting out 145 horsepower) as standard equipment. A new federally mandated system to calculate power was put into effect that year, and the actual engine performance was probably comparable but slightly lower because of pollution controls in the 1972 model year to the  that was listed for the previous year. The Skylark 350 now used a version of the same V8 engine as the base Skylark, but with a 4-barrel Rochester carburetor that generated . Skylark Customs were available with the same 350-cubic-inch V8 engines available in the basic Skylark and the Skylark 350. The Custom had an upgraded interior and dash with some extra chrome. Convertibles only came in the Skylark Customs and the Skylark 350s. For the 1973 model year, the Buick Gran Sports, Skylarks, and Sport Wagons would all be replaced by the new mid-sized Buick Century. Since Centurys were available with Gran Sport trim, the Gran Sport name was once again reduced to being an option package.  In the middle of the 1973 model year, Buick returned to the compact market with the Buick Apollo, using General Motors’ X-body platform, based on the Chevrolet Nova. When the car was extensively restyled for the 1975 model year, the two-door hatchback sedan (coupe) and two-door sedan (coupe) were rechristened “Skylark”, while the four-door sedan remained "Apollo". Two-door hatchback and two-door sedan models were available as the base Skylark or as the more upscale, European-inspired Skylark S/R ("Sports/Rallye"). Four-door sedans were available as the base Apollo or the more upscale Apollo S/R. In addition, there was a very plain, lower-priced Skylark "S" available only as a two-door sedan with minimal interior and exterior trim. "VentiPorts" reappeared integrated into the front half of the rub strip that ran the length of the vehicle, which had disappeared from Skylarks in 1968. The standard engine for the Buick Skylarks was Buick’s own 231-cubic-inch (3.8&nbsp;L) V6 engine with a 2-barrel carburetor creating  at 4000&nbsp;rpm. Buick purchased back the tooling for the engine from American Motors, which acquired them when the company purchased the Kaiser Jeep division from Kaiser Industries. The Apollo used Chevrolet's 250-cubic-inch (4.1&nbsp;L) inline 6-cylinder engine. Optional engines included the Oldsmobile 260-cubic-inch (4.3&nbsp;L) V8 with a two-barrel carburetor producing  at 4,000&nbsp;rpm, and the Buick 350-cubic-inch (5.7&nbsp;L) V8 with either a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor. In 1976, the 5.7&nbsp;L V8 engines produced  at 3,200&nbsp;rpm with the 2-barrel carburetor, and  at 3,400&nbsp;rpm with the 4-barrel carburetor. Beginning with the 1976 model year, the four-door sedans used the Skylark and Skylark S/R names instead of the previous Apollo badge, and came with the 3.8&nbsp;L V6 engine as standard. The 260-cubic-inch (4.3&nbsp;L) V8 was discontinued after the 1976 model year. For the 1977 model year, it was replaced by a pair of V8 engines. Available as an option in 1977 was a 301-cubic-inch (4.9&nbsp;L) V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor, which produced  at 4000&nbsp;rpm (supplied by Pontiac). Also available was a 305-cubic-inch (5.0&nbsp;L) V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor, which produced  at 3800&nbsp;rpm (supplied by Chevrolet). The Buick-built 5.7&nbsp;L V8 was still available, but only with the 4-barrel carburetor. Beginning with the 1978 model year, Chevrolet's 5.7&nbsp;L (350-cubic-inch) V8 with a four-barrel carburetor, which produced  at 3,800&nbsp;rpm, also was available. Also in that year, the Skylark Custom replaced the Skylark S/R as the most luxurious variant. The 1978s also received some very light cosmetic changes to the corner lights and grille.Gunnell (2004), p. 181 The 1979 model year saw the discontinuance of the Skylark Custom two-door hatchback coupe (the base V6 produced  more than 1978's version). The 1979 model year was short because, midway through it, the all-new 1980 models were introduced early. Buick Skylarks were assembled in Iran (4-door models only) from 1977 to 1981 and again from 1986 to 1988 under the brand name of "Buick Iran". The first generations were known as B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, from 1977 until 1981 and the second and last generation was known as the B2 and B3 from 1986 until 1988. The later models were made after GM released the kits and parts to Iran following the release of the 53 hostages held in captivity until 1981. These cars were equipped with a 5.7L engine (SB 350 Chevrolet, L engine, 4BBL), and were fully equipped (power door locks, power window, power steering, automatic transmission, a/c). The Cadillac Seville and Chevrolet Nova were manufactured in Iran during the same period. A total of 40,000 GM cars were produced between 1977 and 1987 in Iran. It appears that these models were basically the same as those built in the U.S. from 1975 to 1979 (Islamic Revolution). It is said that in 1978, the Iranian Chevrolet Nova and Buick Skylark cars had order backlogs of 13 months. GM Iran changed its name to "Pars Khodro" (meaning "Pars Automobile" in Iranian; 'Pars' being the ancient, original name of Persia) after 1979. The production continued from 1979 to 1987 on a part-time basis. Since the spare parts and the assembly-line equipment were not used between 1979 and 1986, the last batch of GM cars built in Iran between 1986 and 87 do not have the same quality as the ones that were made before 1979. GM ceased the production of all vehicles in Iran in 1987. The 1980–1985 Skylark was Buick's badge engineered version of GM's new X-body architecture, shared with the Chevrolet Citation, Pontiac Phoenix, and Oldsmobile Omega and would bear some resemblance to the larger G-body mid-size cars. GM's X-body would become the basis for GM's A-body mid-size cars that would be introduced as 1982 models. The new front-wheel drive Skylark was introduced in the spring of 1979 as an early 1980 model featuring front wheel drive, MacPherson strut front suspension and transversally mounted engine. The new optional 60 degree 2.8&nbsp;L V6 was designed specifically for the X-cars. This platform became the basis for nearly all future GM front wheel drive vehicles. The Skylark was available in two- or four-door sedan bodystyles, and in base, Sport, or Limited trims. The standard 2.5&nbsp;L Iron Duke 4 used a 2-barrel Rochester carburetor and produced  at 4000&nbsp;rpm. The optional 2.8&nbsp;L V6 also used a 2-barrel Rochester carburetor and produced  at 4800&nbsp;rpm. A four-speed manual overdrive transaxle was standard with a three-speed automatic transaxle as an option.  For the 1982 model year, the base 2.5&nbsp;L engine received fuel injection. The optional 2.8&nbsp;L V6 was joined by a more powerful high-output version that produced  at 5400&nbsp;rpm. Also for the 1982 model year, the Skylark received a mild facelift in the form of a new grille (the front parking lamps moved from outside the headlights to inside). In model year 1983, the base Skylark became the Skylark Custom. The Sport model was replaced by the T-Type, which was available only as a two-door coupe and came with the high-output version of the 2.8&nbsp;L V6 engine as standard equipment. In 1985, the last year of production, the X-body Skylark was available only as a four-door sedan in Custom or Limited trim, as the two-door coupe was replaced by Buick's new Somerset Regal coupe, built on GM's new N-body platform, shared with Pontiac's revived Grand Am and the new Oldsmobile Calais. For 1985 the grille was again redesigned, as was the rear. The taillights were wider and the license plate was moved down to the bumper, while a "Buick" plate appeared where the taillights had been.Gunnell (2004), p. 224   Beginning with the 1985 model year, the two-door coupe was replaced by the Somerset Regal coupe built on the Oldsmobile-developed N-body platform. This generation of compact Buicks featured a more upscale and aerodynamic design than its predecessor, incorporating the long-hood/short-deck look popular at the time. With the start of the 1986 model year, it lost the "Regal" suffix from its name and was known simply as Somerset. The Skylark name was moved to a four-door sedan version of the Somerset. This version of the Skylark has a split-bench seat with a center console with a column shift. The 1986 Skylark would continue to be available as either a Custom or a Limited model. The standard engine would continue to be the 2.5&nbsp;L Iron Duke 4, now available with a five-speed manual transaxle as standard and a three-speed automatic as an option. A new optional engine would be the fuel-injected Buick-designed 3.0&nbsp;L V6, generating  at 4900&nbsp;rpm (it replaced the previous 2.8&nbsp;L Chevrolet-designed V6s). The 3.0&nbsp;L V6 was available only with a three-speed automatic transaxle. Beginning with the 1987 model year, the four-door Skylark was available as a sporty T-Type model. In mid-model year, 1987 Skylark models had door-mounted automatic seat belts. For 1988 models, the Somerset name would be dropped and Buick's two-door N-body compact would share the Skylark nameplate with its four-door counterparts. A new engine option for 1988 models was the fuel-injected, Oldsmobile-designed 2.3&nbsp;L DOHC Quad-4 4-cylinder engine that produced  at 5200&nbsp;rpm. An S/E package for Custom models replaced the previous T-Type trim. On 1989 models, a fuel-injected 3.3&nbsp;L V6 (160&nbsp;hp at 5200&nbsp;rpm) replaced the previous 3.0&nbsp;L V6. A new LE package become available on four-door sedans that featured a vinyl roof that covered part of the rear side windows. The three-speed automatic transaxle became standard for 1989. For 1990, a new base Skylark was added, moving the Custom model up to replace the Limited. The S/E package was replaced by a new Gran Sport two-door sedan, reviving a name that had not been connected with the Skylark for many years. The LE ("Luxury Edition") sedan would become a full-fledged model. The 1991 Skylark was a continuation of the 1990 lineup, with virtually no change made to the outward appearance of the car.  Minor mechanical changes were made to the Skylark's optional 3.3L V6 power plant, to include a one piece rear main bearing seal to replace the rope type previously used; and a redesigned camshaft flange. Radical new wedge-shaped styling appeared in 1992, with a sharply pointed grille reminiscent of 1930s Buick Special. The Skylark's new aerodynamic body had a low 0.319 coefficient of drag, compared to 0.374 for the previous version. The pointed grille appearance was used during the mid-1960s on all Buick products. It was initially offered in two- and four-door body styles and in base and Gran Sport versions. The base engine was the 2.3&nbsp;L Quad OHC, which produced  at 5200&nbsp;rpm. The optional 3.3&nbsp;L V6 (standard on the GS) produced  at&nbsp;5200 rpm. All Skylarks came with the three-speed automatic transaxle. For the 1993 model year, the base model was replaced by Custom and Limited trims. For 1994, a new 3.1&nbsp;L V6 (160&nbsp;hp at 5200&nbsp;rpm) replaced the previous 3.3&nbsp;L V6 as standard on the GS and optional on the others. The Limited coupe was dropped for 1994, but returned for 1995. Mechanical changes for the 1995 model year included the upgrading of the standard 2.3&nbsp;L Quad 4 engine from a SOHC design to a DOHC design, increasing power to  at 6000&nbsp;rpm. The three-speed automatic transaxle continued to be standard with the base 4-cylinder engine, but a new four-speed automatic (electronically controlled 4T60-E) was optional with the 4-cylinder engine and standard with the V6.  Skylark received a facelift for the 1996 model year in the form of a more conventional-looking grille. The previous 2.3&nbsp;L I4 was replaced by a new 2.4&nbsp;L DOHC I4 that produced  at 6000&nbsp;rpm. The previous three-speed automatic transaxle was discontinued and the four-speed automatic became standard on all Skylarks. An on-board diagnostic system (OBD II) was standard. Buick offered an "Olympic Gold" edition of the 1996 Skylark to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Olympic Games. It featured gold USA/5-ring badging on the fenders, gold "Skylark" badges, gold-accented wheel covers, and gold accent trim. There were only minor changes to the lineup for the 1997 model year, which was the last year that it would be available to the public in showrooms. A single-model 1998 Skylark sedan was produced for fleet-only sales, mostly to auto rental companies. Most of these 1998 models, the last year that Buick used the Skylark name, were eventually resold to the general public as used cars. After the Skylark's discontinuation, Buick did not produce another compact car until the 2012 the Buick Verano. Production ended on December 4, 1997. The Skylark production line in Lansing was retooled to build the 2000–2003 Chevrolet Malibu.
