    Sport Club Corinthians Paulista () is a Brazilian multisport club based in Tatuapé, São Paulo. Although they compete in a number of different sports, Corinthians is mostly known for its professional association football team. The club currently play in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the top tier of the Brazilian football, as well as in the Campeonato Paulista Série A1, the first division of the traditional in-state competition. The club was founded in 1910 by five railway workers from the district of Bom Retiro, who became impressed by the performances of London-based club Corinthian Football Club, electing Miguel Battaglia as the club's first president. Since then, Corinthians became one of Brazil's most successful clubs, having won the Brasileirão on six occasions, as well as three Copa do Brasil trophies and a record 27 Campeonato Paulista titles. In 2000 the club won the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup as the host nation's representative, repeating the feat in 2012 after winning the Copa Libertadores de América for the first time. Corinthians plays its home matches at the Arena Corinthians, one of the venues in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, hosting six matches during the tournament, including the opening match on 12 June 2014. The club's home kit features white shirts and black shorts, accompanied by white socks, this combination been used since 1920, Nike being the kit manufacturers since 2003. Corinthians holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably against Palmeiras and São Paulo.   In 1910 the football in Brazil was an elitist sport. The top clubs were formed by people who were part of the upper classes. Among them were Club Athletico Paulistano, São Paulo Athletic Club,not to be confused with São Paulo Futebol Clube & Associação Atlética das Palmeiras.do not confuse with Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras  Lower-class society excluded from larger clubs founded their own minnow clubs and only played "floodplain" football. Bucking the trend, a group of five workers of the São Paulo Railway, more precisely Joaquim Ambrose and Anthony Pereira (wall painters), Rafael Perrone (shoemaker), Anselmo Correia (driver) and Carlos Silva (general laborer), residents of the neighborhood of Bom Retiro. It was August 31, 1910 when these workers were watching a match featuring a London-based club touring Brazil, Corinthian F.C..  After the match, while the group returned home, The men spoke of partnerships, business ideas, and general dreams of grandeur. In the mind of each one surfaced a great idea: the foundation of a club, after several exchanges in a lively argument, a common ground led those athletes the same dream. The arguments led to the conclusion that they would meet the next day to make a dream into reality. September 1, 1910. In anticipation of heavy rains, the group agreed to meet after sundown in public sight. That night at 8:30pm, on Rua José Paulino ("Rua dos Imigrantes" (Immigrants Street), underneath the glow of an oil lamp the five workers reunited alongside their guest and neighbors from Bom Retiro. That night the club was founded, alongside its board of directors, who elected Miguel Battaglia as the first Club President. Corinthians played their first match on September 10, 1910, away against União da Lapa, a respected amateur club in São Paulo; and despite being defeated by 1–0, this match would mark the beginning of a successful era as an amateur club. On September 14, Luis Fabi scored Corinthians' first goal against Estrela Polar, another amateur club in the city, and Corinthians won their first game 2–0.  With good results and an increasing number of supporters, Corinthians joined the Liga Paulista, after winning two qualifying games, and played in the São Paulo State Championship for the first time, in 1913. Just one year after joining the league, Corinthians was crowned champion for the first time (in 1914), and were again two years later. There were many fly-by-night teams popping up in São Paulo at the time, and during the first practice held by Corinthians a banner was placed by the side of the field stating "This One Will Last". The year of 1922, the Centennial of Brazilian Independence, marks the start of Corinthians hegemony in the São Paulo State Championship. As football was almost exclusively played at Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo by that time, the two state champions were considered to be the two top clubs in Brazil. After defeating the Rio de Janeiro State Championship champion of that year, América, Corinthians joined the company of the great teams in Brazil. The same year also marked the first of three State Championships in a row, something that happened again in 1928–30 and 1937–39. Corinthians seemed destined to win State Championships in threes; after six years without being a champions, they came won three more from 1937 the 1939. The 1940s were a more difficult time; and the club would win a championship in 1941 and would only win their next in 1951. At the beginning of the 1950s Corinthians made history in the São Paulo Championship. In 1951, the team composed of Carbone, Cláudio, Luisinho, Baltasar and Mário scored 103 goals in thirty matches of the São Paulo Championship, registering an average of 3.43 per game. Carbone was the top goalscorer of the competition with 30 goals. The club would also win the São Paulo Championships of 1952 and 1954. In this same decade, Corinthians were champions three times of the Rio-São Paulo Championship (1950, 1953 and 1954), the tournament that was becoming most important in the country with the increased participation of the greatest clubs from the two most important footballing states in the country. In 1953, in a championship in Venezuela, Corinthians won the Small Cup of the World, a championship that many consider as a precursor of the Worldwide Championship of Clubs. On the occasion, Corinthians, substituting for Vasco da Gama, went to Caracas, the Venezuelan capital and recorded six consecutive victories against Roma (1–0 and 3–1), Barcelona (3–2 and 1–0) and Selection of Caracas (2–1 and 2–0). The club would also win the Cup of the Centenary of São Paulo, in the same year (1954).  After the triumphs in the São Paulo Championship and the Rio-São Paulo of 1954, Corinthians had a lengthy title drought. The breakthrough finally came when they won the São Paulo state championship in 1977, breaking a string of 23 years without a major title. Under the leadership of Sócrates, Wladimir and Casagrande, Corinthians were the first Brazilian club in which players decided about concentração, a common Brazilian practice where the football players were locked up in a hotel days before a game, and discussed politics. (In the early 1980s, military dictatorship, after two decades, ended in Brazil). In 1982, before the election of government of São Paulo State, the team wore a kit with the words: DIA 15 VOTE (Vote on 15th),BORBA, Marco Aurélio (November 5, 1982) "O Timão cheio de bossas". Revista Placar. pp. 50-53 trying to motivate the biggest number of fans to vote. In 1990, Corinthians won their first Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, beating their rivals, São Paulo in the final at the opponents' own stadium, Estádio do Morumbi.Campeonato Brasileiro Série A 1990 at RSSSF  In the following year, Corinthians beat Flamengo and won the Supercopa do Brasil.Supercopa do Brasil at RSSSF  In the 1995, the club won the Copa do Brasil for the first time, beating Grêmio in the final at the Estádio Olímpico Monumental in Porto Alegre.Copa do Brasil 1995 at RSSSF  In the same decade, the club won the state championship in 1995, 1997 and 1999,Campeonato Paulista at RSSSF  and won the national championship again in 1998 and in 1999.Campeonato Brasileiro Série A at RSSSF  In 2000, Corinthians won the first edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, beating Vasco in the final played at the Estádio do Maracanã. To reach the final, Corinthians finished ahead of Real Madrid of Spain, Al-Nasr of Saudi Arabia and Raja Casablanca of Morocco. In the same decade, the club won the state championship in 2001 and in 2003 and the Copa do Brasil in 2002, beating Brasiliense in the final.Copa do Brasil 2002 at RSSSF  Between 1990 and 2005, the club also won the Ramón de Carranza Trophy in 1996, the Rio-São Paulo Tournament in 2002, the São Paulo Youth Cup in 1995, 1999, 2004, and 2005, and the Dallas Cup in 1999 and 2000. The club's situation in early 2004 was among the most difficult in their history. Bad administration, lack of money and terrible campaigns both in the 2003 Brazilian Championship and in the 2004 São Paulo State Championship caused their millions of supporters to worry. Fortunately, some young players and a new manager Tite helped the team to improve from their terrible start. At the end of the championship, Corinthians finished in 5th place and gained entry to the Copa Sudamericana (a minor continental championship). This situation was one of the factors which enabled Corinthians' president, Alberto Dualib, to convince the club's advisors to sign a controversial deal with an international fund of investors called Media Sports Investment. The deal granted the company a large degree of control over the club for 10 years in exchange for large financial investments in return. This has brought many quality players to the team, such as Carlos Tevez, Roger, Javier Mascherano and Carlos Alberto. Despite the MSI investments, Corinthians experienced a slow start in the 2005 state championship, but managed to improve as it progressed, eventually managing to finish second. Their start to the Brazilian championship during 2005 was difficult, too, but after Daniel Passarella's dismissal (due to an unexpected 5–1 loss to Corinthians' rivals, São Paulo), the club finished the championship round well, and were eventually crowned Brazilian Champions for the fourth time, after a controversial annulment of eleven games due to a betting scandal. The relationship between Corinthians' managers and the MSI president, Kia Joorabchian was not good, and after being eliminated in the Copa Libertadores, the club experienced a crisis which was responsible for the bad performances for the rest of 2006. Eventually, the partnership came to an end. On December 2, 2007, following a 1–1 draw away to Grêmio, Corinthians were relegated to the second division. Corinthians, who won promotion to the top division of Brazilian football for 2009 by winning the Serie B tournament, signed with three-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo.Brazilian Ronaldo set to join Corinthians – The Telegraph, December 9, 2008Ronaldo agrees to join Corinthians – The Independent, December 9, 2008 In 2009, led by Ronaldo, Corinthians won their 26th Campeonato Paulista and their third Copa do Brasil. Confirming the club's good moment, Corinthians finished the Campeonato Brasileiro 2010 in 3rd place, granting their place on the subsequent Copa Libertadores. After being eliminated from the South American tournament by the relatively less traditional Deportes Tolima, though, Corinthians saw Ronaldo retire from football. To replace him, the club signed with other 2006 national squad veteran Adriano. In 2011, Corinthians won their fifth national title. On July 4, after reaching the final of the 2012 Copa Libertadores undefeated, Corinthians won its first title after a two-match final against 6-time champions Boca Juniors by drawing 1–1 in Argentina and accomplishing an inaugural victory at the Estádio do Pacaembu in São Paulo winning 2–0, becoming the ninth Brazilian side to win the Copa Libertadores. After this historical title, Corinthians is considered the most valuable club in Brazil. The club won the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup for the second time after defeating English club Chelsea 1–0 on December 16, 2012. The Corinthians' shirt had no crest before 1913, when the club joined the Liga Paulista Even though the club has been recognized by the colors black and white for most of their history, the first Corinthians' kit originally consisted of cream shirts and black shorts. But when the shirts were washed, the cream color gradually became white. After that, early in the club's history, the official colors were changed, so the club would not waste much money on buying new kits. In 1954 the black with thin white stripes uniform was introduced, and became the alternative uniform. The original cream color of the first uniform would come back as a reference in 2007, with the golden third uniform. The purple has been associated as a fan color for a long time and, since 2008, has been used as a successful third uniform: in popular culture, a corintiano roxo (purple corintiano) is a fanatic supporter of Corinthians. Unlike the shirt, the shield of Corinthians went through several changes over the years. While the Corinthians disputed only friendlies and "futebol de várzea" (Floodplain Football, Paulista Colloquial language for Amateur Football). The first crest was hastily created for a game against Minas Gerais, it was valid for qualifying for the 1913 Liga Paulista de Football, and was simply composed of the letters "C" and "P" (Corinthians Paulista) laced together.1913: Nasce o Mosqueteiro corintiano - Lance1, May 28, 2010 The third shield would be used until the following year, when Hermogenes Barbuy, lithographer and brother of the player Amilcar, created the first official shield, developing a framework for the letters and added the 'S " ( Sport), which premiered at the friendly against Torino (Italy), in São Paulo.1914 - O primeiro título e o primeiro ídolo - Lance!, May 29, 2010 Shortly thereafter, the frame gets larger, and from 1919 the distinctive beginning to form the current format, which includes the flag of São Paulo in the center. In 1937, Getúlio Vargas lowered the status of the New State and made a public ceremony with the burning of flags of all States in the Federation, in order to symbolize his desire to strengthen the centralized government. Yet, the flag of São Paulo survived inside the shell of the Corinthians. After the fall of the regime, the freedom to use of regional symbols was once again permitted. In 1939, the shield has won a string around the circle, and the two oars and anchor, in allusion to the club's success in nautical sports. The design was created by a Modernist painter Francisco Rebolo, who played for Corinthians reserve squad in the 1920s. Thereafter, the symbol Corinthian passed through small changes over time, specifically the flag and the frame. In 1990, the first star was added in reference to the first Brazilian title. The same was done with the achievements of 1998, 1999 and 2005, and a larger yellow star above the others, in honor of winning the FIFA World Cup 2000. Before 2011, the Corinthians board decided to remove all the stars. Corinthians began the 2012 Season with Johnson & Johnson Brazilian consumer brand Jontex as its main sponsor."Jontex ganha destaque na camisa do Corinthians". Exame. Retrieved July 15, 2012.

More precisely in the old street of Immigrants, current Rua José Paulino. It was actually a stadium, but a vacant lot owned by a seller of firewood.1918: Corinthians teve seu primeiro estádio - Lance!, June 2, 2010 It was nicknamed "Field Lenheiro."   It was the time of the floodplain and the players themselves had to clean and flatten the lawn. In January 1918, Corinthians opened its first stadium, in Great Bridge (now the Bridge of Flags), on the banks of Tiete River. The land was leased from the municipality under the influence of the intellectual Antonio de Alcantara Machado, one of the first to approach the club workers. Stood beside the Chácara da Floresta, AA das Palmeiras (one of the largest clubs in the city so far)'s stadium and was built by the players and fans in a community helping system.  The Corinthians played their games there until 1927. They played 138 games with 83 wins, 43 draws and 12 defeats.Corinthians 5000 Jogos: Clube - Lance!, February 17, 2008 In 1926, the club purchased Parque São Jorge, located within the Tatuapé. The Parque São Jorge belonged to Esporte Clube Sírio, a rival in the disputes of the football season. After purchase, then-President Ernesto Cassano decided to reform the stage, with financial support from the members.1926: Timão compra o Parque São Jorge - Lance!, June 10, 2010  While the reforms were carried out, followed the Corinthians sending their matches in the area of Great Bridge. Once stopped reforms in the Parque São Jorge, in 1928, the field of Ponte Grande was donated to São Bento (no relation to present-day Esporte Clube São Bento). The renovated Parque São Jorge, still without floodlights, was inaugurated on July 22, in a friendly game against América-RJ.1928: Satanás, ídolo e muralha corintiana - Lance!, June 12, 2010 The land purchased with the original included a Syrian farm - hence the nickname "Fazendinha", still used today. It was from here that the Corinthians began to develop and could build up its headquarters. In Estádio Alfredo Schürig, the official name of "Fazendinha", the club only played in 468 deals, with 346 wins, 60 draws and 62 defeats. 1312 goals were scored by Timão and 480 conceded. The last game played there was a friendly against Brasiliense on August 3, 2002. Currently, the Parque São Jorge is used for training and games of smaller categories. The board has the idea of reforming it, but the plans never leave paper. With the growing number of fans, Corinthians began operating in major stadiums, in particular, the club has established a relationship with Paulo Machado de Carvalho Stadium, which belongs to the municipality of São Paulo and is best known as Pacaembu Stadium.1940: A primeira partida do Corinthians no Pacaembu - Lance!, June 24, 2010  Some 50,000 fans attended the inauguration of the stadium on April 28 of 1940. The primary pitted Palestra Italia and Coritiba. Then, the game between Corinthians background, then current three-time champion São Paulo, and Atlético Mineiro, Corinthians won by 4–2. The Pacaembu was opened as the largest stadium in the Latin America, with capacity for 70,000 people. In 1942, little more than 70,000 people came to the stadium to watch the match between Corinthians and São Paulo, in particular by the attacker Leonidas da Silva, idol-Pauline and are considered the best Brazilian player in his time.1942: Corinthians conquista o Torneio Quinela de Ouro - Lance!, June 26, 2010 The game ended tied at 3–3 and the public was never beaten that game at the stadium. Currently, the Pacaembu has capacity for up to 40,000 spectators. Former partner group HTMF bought land in the Raposo Tavares Highway in the late 1990s for the stadium construction, but the partnership ended soon after that.  In 2009 there were some conjectures that the government of São Paulo could make a deal for a 30-year allotment of Pacaembu, but it never materialized, even though it was the club's directors preference, with projects designed to that matter. After Estádio do Morumbi, then named as the city's host in the World Cup, failed to comply to FIFA's standards, a new project to create a home for Corinthians emerged as a possibility. In August 2010 the president of CBF, Ricardo Teixeira, along with Governor of São Paulo state, Alberto Goldman, and the mayor of São Paulo, Gilberto Kassab announced that the opening ceremony of the World Cup of Brazil would be held in the New Corinthians Stadium to be built in the district of Itaquera, in the eastern part of São Paulo city.

The Corinthians fanbase is fondly called the "Faithful", starring memorable moments like the "Corinthian Invasion" (pt / Invasão Corinthiana) in 1976, when more than 70,000 Corinthians Fans traveled from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro to watch the match against Fluminense at Maracana Stadium, in that year's national championship semifinals, as well as having one of the biggest average attendances in the country. Fans being famous for being passionate about the team and loyal supporters motivated the club to make a tribute documentary to their fans, named  "Faithful" (pt / Fiel), highlighting the fans' support in one of the most difficult moments in the club's history: the relegation to national second division in 2007. Similar initiatives would be made in the next years, reflecting other moments in the club's history in that the fanbase was essential. Motto:  "Lealdade, Humildade e Procedimento" (Loyalty, Humility & Procedure) Gaviões da Fiel was founded on 1 July 1969, but its ideology began to be thought of before. In 1965, young Corinthians fans gathered in the stands in order to question the political and administrative life of the Corinthians. The members gathered in different locations, members homes, workplaces, & public squares. This group was distinguished by a passion for the club and have characteristics idealizing and fulfilling. The foundation of Gaviões, on 1 July 1969, came during a bleak time for Brazilians, amidst the military dictatorship. At a time when freedom of expression was virtually nonexistent, these young fans began to attempt recover political and administrative control of Corinthians. The Corinthians were under the administration of Wadih Helu, who for years tried to prevent the creation of the Gaviões through several reprisals. This persecution was not enough to make them give up and gradually his ideas were maturing. "I had decided that the name of the club should contain faithful, as well as the fans were already known to the Corinthians that even after 15 years without winning a single title, crowds took to the stage." What was simply an utopia of young lovers and revolutionary thoughts turned into reality: Gaviões da Fiel was born. However, the persecution of the managers of the Corinthians is not over. There were many attempts to escape the ideas of these young people. However, in 1972, Wadih plate Helu lost the election to Miguel Martinez, who took command of the Corinthians. The Hawks of the Faithful attempted unprecedented act in its history: the overthrow of a Military Dictator took precedence over the Timão. Miguel Martinez, even though it was supported by the Hawks of the Faithful, tried to influence its founders, so that they would not pressure the new administration of the club and not put into practice some of their politically revolutionary ideas. In July 1971, the Gaviões underwent its first political crisis, as one of the founders accepted the proposal of the Corinthians to leave Gavioes da Fiel & create a more moderate / Non-Politicized Torcida. Like everything that involves the Corinthians and passion of its fans, the Hawks of the Faithful loomed up and multiplied, rapidly assuming the position of the largest organized supporters of Brazil. The attitude of these young people began to increasingly disturbing the Dictatorship, especially when the Hawks of the Faithful had spoken publicly against the military dictatorship, displaying a banner in a match at Morumbi asking for “Anistia ampla, geral e irrestrita” (Widespread amnesty, blatant & unrestricted). This protest led to the conviction of then Gaviões president, being the first public entity to openly manifest itself against the regime. Currently, the torcida has 97,177 members (January 14, 2013), The largest Organized Torcida in Brazil.  Motto:  "O Jogador das arquibancadas" (The player of the terraces) Camisa 12 was founded in August 1971, the non-politicized offshoot of Gaviões da Fiel. The greatest moment for the torcida came in 1976, during "Invasão Corintiana",  in a memorable semi-final against Fluminense, Camisa 12 actively participated. When Over 70,000 Corinthians fans from São Paulo made the 280 mile trip to Rio da Janeiro's Maracana Stadium with scores of Flags, Banners, & Percussion Ensembles. The attendance for that match was 147,000+. Over 15,000 members Motto: "Preso por uma só Paixão" (Incarcerated by a single passion) It was founded on September 9, 1990 by nine Timão fans in honor of the team Football Carandiru House of Detention. The symbol adopted was from the Disney Cartoon DuckTales of its antagonists The Beagle Boys. The torcida grew out of a social program carried out in Carandiru Penitentiary, once the largest prison in Latin American (Now Demolished) & site of the Carandiru Massacre. Where a group of friends, young fans of Corinthians, formed a team and promoting a charity football match against a team of Carandiru detainees,  mainly composed of Corinthians supporters, all from the ninth pavilion of the institution, hence its name. This group, through raffles, promotions and sports culture contributions, began to raise funds for the making banners and flags to divulge the its philosophy on games in the stadiums of the Corinthians. The idea of creating an organized torcida was and to mature on September 9, 1990 officially became a Corinthians Organized Torcida, christened The Pavilion Nine. Over 12,000 members Motto: "Raça e Atitude" (Bravery & Demeanor) Motto: "A Mais Fanática do Interior" (The Most Fanatical in the Interior) Fiel Macabra, Founded on October 4, 1993 in Bauru, SP.  This torcida was founded by a group of friends that regularly met in Bauru cafeteria. After its initial 3 years, it opened an official headquarter in Bauru, with 5 other offices following soon at the interior of São Paulo.  With about 1,800 Members, it is the team's largest ultras in the interior of São Paulo.  Motto: "Torcer e Beber pelo Corinthians" (Drink & Root for Corinthians) Coringão Chopp, Founded on October 14, 1989. This torcida's origins begin in the 1980s on a Greater São Paulo courtyard. The local was frequented by a group of friends who met casually to play street football & drink beers together after Corinthians games.  In 1989, These friends decided frequent Corinthians matches as a unit, They began by going in separate cars. That year their group of friends grew, all them from Greater São Paulo, mainly The ABC Region & their courtyard became a "Meeting Point" for the masses of new friends.  That same year, the owner of the courtyard known as Dinho was discussing the sheer volume of Corinthians Fans that considered his courtyard as a Pre-match meeting point. It was that moment when Dinho & friends realized that they had the numbers to create an organized torcida.  The members of the newly created torcida, reached a simple agreement on what to name themselves. They agreed that they both had a passion for Corinthians & Chopp (Draught beer). After years of growth in membership, respect, & acceptance, the torcida moved out of the Courtyard & set up a headquarters in Diadema. Over 6,000 members Many of the Torcidas above have Sub-sedes (Branch Offices) established by fans living outside of São Paulo. Gavioes in particular has 10, 8 In-State, 1 Out-of-State Brasilia, & 1 International Japan. Camisa 12 with 8, 6 In-State, 2 Out-of-State Minas Gerais & Espírito Santo. Pavilhão Nove with 10, 9 In-State, 1 Out-of-State Mato Grosso do Sul. Estopim da Fiel with 10, 8 In-State, 2 Out-of-State Parana & Minas Gerais. Fiel Macabra with 6, 5 In-State, 1 Out-of-State Rio Grande do Sul. Coringão Chopp with 5, all in-state. Corinthians' official mascot is the Musketeer, a symbol of bravery, audacity and fighting spirit. The adoption of that character recalls the first years of the club. In 1913 most of the leading football clubs in São Paulo State founded the APEA (Paulista Athletic Sports Association). The depleted Paulista League was left with only Americano, Germania and Internacional, known as the "three musketeers" of São Paulo football. Corinthians joined the three as D'Artagnan, being the fourth and most adored musketeer, just like in Alexandre Dumas, père's novel The Three Musketeers. To be accepted in that "musketeers universe", Corinthians had to show their bravery. As there was many other teams who coveted the spot in the Liga Paulista, Corinthians participated in a selective tournament against Minas Gerais and São Paulo, two other great teams of Paulista amateur football at that time. The Corinthian team beat Minas 1–0 and São Paulo 4–0, earning acceptance into the group and acquiring the right to participate in the Special Division of the Paulista League in the following year. An important symbol for Corinthians is Saint George/(Ogum). Saint George is one of the most revered Catholic Saints in Brazil, a nation with a blend of cultures.  The collusion between African & European cultures is seen in Brazil's definition of São Jorge as a mash between Catholicism & Western African Mythology.  The comparison may be drawn the entities similar characteristics; St George, the soldier who protects those who pray to him; Ogum God of War who serves the communities who believe in him.  it is this warrior demeanor that made Corinthians fans indebted to São Jorge. Corinthians began as a small team for the lower classes of São Paulo, even though they obtained initial success.  Lack of respect for the working class by forced Corinthians to leave their São Paulo State Football League in protest.  after multiple championships Timão made its largest leap in prestige in the founding of a Corinthians' Headquarters, 1926.  The creation of said headquarters became the first fusion of Timão & São Jorge.  The land purchased for the headquarters was formerly Parque São Jorge (St. George Park) at 777 Rua São Jorge, Tatuapé, São Paulo, SP. Corinthians support for São Jorge became fanatical during the decade of the 60's, Between 1954 and 1977, Corinthians failed to add to its gallery of conquests and the Corinthian Nation lived the hardest moments of its history. While the stream struggled in the 60's, fan recanted that they were blessed by a "Santo Guerreiro" (Warrior Saint). In the early 60's the lack of success lingered in the minds of fans & gave birth to a utilization of the blessings of São Jorge.  this caused Corinthians to erect a chapel in honor of the saint, in order to strengthen the clubs resolve via mysticism.  1969, after the death of two players Lidu & Eduardo, the funeral was held in Capela São Jorge, & strengthened the clubs identity at a time when championships were non-existent. 1974 Paulista Final, after a heart-wrenching loss to arch-rival Palmeiras,  composer Paulinho Nogueira recorded "Oh Corinthians", a song that had popular commercial success at the time.
