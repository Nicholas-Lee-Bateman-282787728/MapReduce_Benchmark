 In economics, the marginal utility of a good or service is the utility of the specific use to which an economically rational agent would put a given increase in that good or service, or of the specific use that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.  In other words, marginal utility is the utility of the  marginal use — the least urgent use of the good or service, from the best feasible combination of actions in which its use is included.von Wieser, Friedrich; Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes [The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics] (1884), p. 128.Wieser, Friedrich von; Der natürliche Werth [Natural Value] (1889), Bk I Ch V “Marginal Utility” (HTML).  Under the mainstream assumptions, the marginal utility of a good or service is the posited quantified change in  utility obtained by using one more or one less unit of that good or service. This concept grew out of attempts by economists to explain the determination of price.  The term “marginal utility”, creditted to the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser by Alfred Marshall,Streissler, E., “Wieser, Friedrich, Freiherr von”, The New Palgrave:  A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4  (1987), p. 921. was a translation of Wieser's term “Grenznutzen” (border-use). Constraints are conceptualized as a border or margin.  The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her endowment, broadly conceived to include opportunities.  This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual himself or herself. A value that holds true given particular constraints is a marginal value.  A change that would be effected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a marginal change, as large as the smallest relevant division of that good or service.  For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in neoclassical analysis that goods and services are continuously divisible.  In such context, a marginal change may be an infinitesimal change or a limit.  However, strictly speaking, the smallest relevant division may be quite large.  Different conceptions of utility were and have been employed during and subsequent to the development of theory employing notions of marginal utility.  It has been common among economists to describe utility as corresponding to a measure, that is to say, as being quantifiable.Stigler, George Joseph; “The Development of Utility Theory”, I and II, Journal of Political Economy (1950), issues 3 and 4.Stigler, George Joseph; “The Adoption of Marginal Utility Theory” History of Political Economy (1972).  This has significantly affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility.  Conceptions of utility that entail quantification allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.  However, conceptions without even weak quantification are able to consider rational preferences that would otherwise be excluded.Mc Culloch, James Huston; “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”, Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie 37 (1977) #3&amp;4 (September). Benthamite philosophy equated usefulness with the production of pleasure and avoidance of pain,Bentham, Jeremy; Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, Chapter I §I-III. conceptualized as subject to arithmetic operation.Bentham, Jeremy; Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, Chapter IV.  British economists, under the influence of this philosophy (especially by way of John Stuart Mill), conceptualized utility as “the feelings of pleasure and pain”Jevons, William Stanley; “Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society v29 (June 1866) §2. and further as a “quantity of feeling” (emphasis added).Jevons, William Stanley; “Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society v29 (June 1866) §4. The Austrian School more generally attributes value to the satisfaction of needs,Menger, Carl; Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre (Principles of Economics) Chapter 2 §2. did not depend upon a presumption of quantification,Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas; “Utility”, International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (1968). and sometimes rejects even the possibility of quantification.von Mises, Ludwig Heinrich; Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel (1912). The mainstream of contemporary economic theory frequently defers ontological questions, and merely notes or assumes that preference structures conforming to certain rules can be usefully proxied by associating goods, services, or uses thereof with quantities, and defines “utility” as such a quantification.Kreps, David Marc; A Course in Microeconomic Theory, “Chapter two: The theory of consumer choice and demand”, “Utility representations”.  Recognizing that preference may be taken as the determinant of usefulness, this conception doesn't depart from the concept of usefulness. Under any standard conception, the same object may have different marginal utilities for different people, reflecting different preferences or individual circumstances. An individual will typically be able to partially order the potential uses of a good or service.  For example, a ration of water might be used to sustain oneself, a dog, or a rose bush.  Say that a given person gives her own sustenance highest priority, that of the dog next highest priority, and lowest priority to saving the roses.  In that case, if the individual has two rations of water, then the marginal utility of either of those rations is that of sustaining the dog.  The marginal utility of a third unit would be that of watering the roses. (The diminishing of utility should not necessarily be taken to be itself an arithmetic subtraction. It may be no more than a purely ordinal change.) The notion that marginal utilities are diminishing across the ranges relevant to decision-making is called “the law of diminishing marginal utility” (and also known as a “Gossen's First Law”).  However, it will not always hold.  The case of the person, dog, and roses is one in which potential uses operate independently — there is no complementarity across the three uses.  Sometimes an amount added brings things past a desired tipping point, or an amount subtracted causes them to fall short.  In such cases, the marginal utility of a good or service might actually be increasing. While the above example conforms to ordinary notions of self-interested behavior, the concept and logic of marginal utility are independent of the presumption that people pursue self-interest.  For example, a different person might give highest priority to the rose bush, next highest to the dog, and last to himself.  In that case, if the individual has three rations of water, then the marginal utility of any one of those rations is that watering the person.  With just two rations, the person is left unwatered and the marginal utility of either ration is that of the dog.  Likewise, a person could give highest priority to the needs of one of her neighbors, next to another, and so forth, placing her own welfare last; the concept of diminishing marginal utility would still apply. Marginalism explains choice with the hypothesis that people decide whether to effect any given change based on the marginal utility of that change, with rival alternatives being chosen based upon which has the greatest marginal utility. If an individual has a stock or flow of a good or service whose marginal utility is less than would be that of some other good or service for which he or she could trade, then it is in his or her interest to effect that trade.  Of course, as one thing is traded-away and another is acquired, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades are now changed.  On the assumption that the marginal utility of one is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, an individual will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed.  If any trader can better his or her own marginal position by offering a trade more favorable to complementary traders, then he or she will do so. In an economy with money, the marginal utility of a quantity is simply that of the best good or service that it could purchase. Hence, the “law” of diminishing marginal utility provides an explanation for diminishing marginal rates of substitution and thus for the “laws” of supply and demand, as well as essential aspects of models of “imperfect” competition.  The “law” of diminishing marginal utility is said to explain the “paradox of water and diamonds”, most commonly associated with Adam SmithSmith, Adam; An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) Chapter IV. “Of the Origin and Use of Money”. (though recognized by earlier thinkers).  Human beings cannot even survive without water, whereas diamonds were in Smith's day mere ornamentation or engraving bits.  Yet water had a very low price, and diamonds a very high price, by any normal measure.  Marginalists explained that it is the marginal usefulness of any given quantity that determines its price, rather than the usefulness of a class or of a totality.  For most people, water was sufficiently abundant that the loss or gain of a gallon would withdraw or add only some very minor use if any; whereas diamonds were in much more restricted supply, so that the lost or gained use would be much greater. That is not to say that the price of any good or service is simply a function of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual.  Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities. The “law” does not tell us such things as why diamonds are naturally less abundant on the earth than is water, but helps us to understand how this affects the value imputed to a given diamond and the price of diamonds in a market. Many critics of marginalism would reply that the reason that diamonds are more expensive than water is not because of their relative natural abundance but because of their cost of production. The reason water is available abundantly and diamonds in relatively smaller quantities is because one is inexpensive to produce and one very expensive. Critics claim that thus the reason water is cheaper than diamonds is simply because it costs less to produce. If diamonds could be produced cheaply from carbon, as modern technology may make possible in the short term, then the price of diamonds will fall, even though the demand for their use has not altered. Therefore, as these critics would claim, it is the cost of production which determines price, not the marginal utility. Marginalists simply respond that if this were true then, rather than our seeing some goods and services not produced because their costs exceeded their prices, consumers would make a practice of seeking expensive wares without regard to their use. (As proto-marginalist Richard Whately put it, “It is not that pearls fetch a high price because men have dived for them; but on the contrary, men dive for them because they fetch a high price.”Whately, Richard; Introductory Lectures on Political Economy, Being part of a course delivered in the Easter term (1832).) Marginalists explain that costs of production may be what limit supply, but that these costs of production are themselves sacrificed marginal uses, and will not be borne when they are expected to exceed the marginal use of what is produced.  In other words, the marginalist certainly does not explain price as a simple function of the marginal utility of a single good for one person or for some “average” person, but nonetheless insists that it results from the trade-offs that each participant would be willing to make for the various goods and services at stake, with those trade-offs being determined by marginal uses.  The critics who believe that costs of production determine price, by assuming a demand that will bear the cost, have begged the essential question that the marginalists purport to answer. Under the special case in which usefulness can be quantified, the change in utility of moving from state S_1 to state S_2 is \Delta U=U(S_2)-U(S_1)\, Moreover, if S_1 and S_2 are distinguishable by values of just one variable g\, which is itself quantified, then it becomes possible to speak of the ratio of the marginal utility of the change in g\, to the size of that change: \left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.} (where “c.p.” indicates that the only independent variable to change is g\,).  Mainstream neoclassical economics will typically assume that \lim_{\Delta g\to 0}{\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}} is well defined, and use “marginal utility” to refer to a partial derivative \frac{\partial U}{\partial g}\approx\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.} and diminishing marginal utility is similarly taken to correspond to \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial g^2}<0</math>  == History == === Proto-marginalist approaches ===  A great variety of economists concluded that there was ''some'' sort of inter-relationship between utility and rarity that effected economic decisions, and in turn informed the determination of prices.<ref>[[Karl Přibram|Přibram, Karl]]; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' ([[1983]]).</ref>  === Marginalists before the Revolution === [[Image:Gabriel Cramer 2.jpg|thumb|105px|Gabriel Cramer]] The first published statement of any sort of theory of marginal utility was by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], in “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis”.<ref>Bernoulli, Daniel; “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis” in ''Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae'' 5 ([[1738]]); reprinted in translation as “Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk” in ''Econometrica'' 22 (1954).</ref>  This paper appeared in [[1738]], but a draft had been written in [[1731]] or in [[1732]].<ref>Bernoulli, Daniel; letter of [[4 July]] [[1731]] to Nicolas Bernoulli ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF]).</ref><ref>Bernoulli, Nicolas; letter of [[5 April]] [[1732]], acknowledging receipt of “Specimen theoriae novae metiendi sortem pecuniariam” ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF]).</ref>  In [[1728]], [[Gabriel Cramer]] had produced fundamentally the same theory in a private letter.<ref>Cramer, Garbriel; letter of [[21 May]] [[1728]] to [[Nicolaus Bernoulli]] ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF]).</ref>  Each had sought to resolve the [[St. Petersburg paradox]], and had concluded that the marginal desirability of money decreased as it was accumulated, more specifically such that the desirability of a sum were the [[natural logarithm]] (Bernoulli) or [[square root]] (Cramer) thereof.  However, the more general implications of this hypothesis were not explicated, and the work fell into obscurity.  In “A Lecture on the Notion of Value”, delivered in [[1833]] and included in ''Lectures on Population, Value, Poor Laws and Rent'' ([[1837]]), [[William Forster Lloyd]] explicitly offered a general marginal utility theory, but did not offer its derivation nor elaborate its implications.  The importance of his statement seems to have been lost on everyone (including Lloyd) until the early [[20th century]], by which time others had independently developed and popularized the same insight.<ref>[[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman|Seligman, Edwin Robert Anderson]]; “On some neglected British economists”, ''Economic Journal'' v. 13 (September 1903).</ref>  In ''An Outline of the Science of Political Economy'' ([[1836]]), [[Nassau William Senior]] asserted that marginal utilities were the ultimate determinant of demand, yet apparently did not pursue implications, though some interpret his work as indeed doing just that.<ref>White, Michael V; “Diamonds Are Forever(?): Nassau Senior and Utility Theory” in ''The Manchester School of Economic &amp; Social Studies'' 60 (1992) #1 (March).</ref>  In [[1854]], [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] published ''Die Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln'', which presented a marginal utility theory and to a very large extent worked-out its implications for the behavior of a market economy.  However, Gossen's work was not well received in the Germany of his time, most copies were destroyed unsold, and he was virtually forgotten until rediscovered after the so-called Marginal Revolution.  === The Marginal Revolution === :''“Marginal revolution” redirects here. For the economics weblog, see [[Marginal Revolution (blog)]].'' Marginalism eventually found a foot-hold by way of the work of three economists, [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] in England, [[Carl Menger|Menger]] in Austria, and [[Léon Walras|Walras]] in Switzerland. [[Image:Jevons.jpeg|thumb|105px|William Stanley Jevons]] [[William Stanley Jevons]] first proposed the theory in [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/jevons/mathem.txt “A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”] ([http://www.eco.utexas.edu/~hmcleave/jevonsmath.pdf PDF]), a paper presented in 1862 and published in 1863, followed by a series of works culminating in his book ''The Theory of Political Economy'' in 1871 that established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time. Jevons' conception of utility was in the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] tradition of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and of [[John Stuart Mill]], but he differed from his [[classical economics|classical]] predecessors in emphasizing that "value depends entirely upon utility", in particular, on "final utility upon which the theory of Economics will be found to turn."<ref>W. Stanley Jevons (1871), ''The Theory of Political Economy'', p. 111.</ref> He later qualified this in deriving the result that in a model of exchange equilibrium, price ratios would be proportional to not only to ratios of "final degrees of utility" but costs of production.<ref>W.

Collison Brown (1987), "Jevons, William Stanley," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 2, pp. 1008-09.</ref>   [[Carl Menger]] presented the theory in [http://docs.mises.de/Menger/Menger_Grundsaetze.pdf ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre''] (translated as [http://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp ''Principles of Economics'']) in 1871.  Menger's presentation is peculiarly notable on two points.  First, he took special pains to explain ''why'' individuals should be expected to rank possible uses and then to use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs. (For this reason, Menger and his followers are sometimes called “the Psychological School”, though they are more frequently known as “the [[Austrian School]]” or as “the Vienna School”.) Second, while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not.<ref name="georgescu-rogen" />  Menger's work found a significant and appreciative audience.  [[Léon Walras|Marie-Esprit-Léon Walras]] introduced the theory in ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'', the first part of which was published in 1874 in a relatively mathematical exposition.  Walras's work found relatively few readers at the time but was recognized and incorporated two decades later in the work of [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] and [[Enrico Barone|Barone]].<ref>Donald A. Walker  (1987), "Walras, Léon" ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 4, p. 862.</ref>   An American, [[John Bates Clark]], is sometimes also mentioned.  But, while Clark independently arrived at a marginal utility theory, he did little to advance it until it was clear that the followers of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were revolutionizing economics.  Nonetheless, his contributions thereafter were profound.  ==== The second generation ==== [[Image:Vilfredo Pareto.jpg|thumb|105px|Vilfredo Pareto]] Although the Marginal Revolution flowed from the work of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, their work might have failed to enter the mainstream were it not for a second generation of economists.  In England, the second generation were exemplified by [[Philip Wicksteed|Philip Henry Wicksteed]], by [[William Smart]], and by [[Alfred Marshall]]; in Austria by [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and by [[Friedrich von Wieser]]; in Switzerland by [[Vilfredo Pareto]]; and in America by [[Herbert Joseph Davenport]] and by [[Frank Fetter|Frank A. Fetter]].  There were significant, distinguishing features amongst the approaches of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, but the second generation did not maintain distinctions along national or linguistic lines.  The work of von Wieser was heavily influenced by that of Walras.  Wicksteed was heavily influenced by Menger.  Fetter referred to himself and Davenport as part of “the American Psychological School”, named in imitation of the Austrian “Psychological School”. (And Clark's work from this period onward similarly shows heavy influence by Menger.)  William Smart began as a conveyor of Austrian School theory to English-language readers, though he fell increasingly under the influence of Marshall.<ref name="salerno">Salerno, Joseph T. 1999; “The Place of Mises’s Human Action in the Development of Modern Economic Thought.” ''Quarterly Journal of Economic Thought'' v. 2 (1).</ref>  Böhm-Bawerk was perhaps the most able expositor of Menger's conception.<ref>Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von. “Grundzüge der Theorie des wirtschaftlichen Güterwerthes”, ''Jahrbüche für Nationalökonomie und Statistik'' v 13 (1886).  Translated as ''Basic Principles of Economic Value''.</ref><ref name="salerno" />  He was further noted for producing a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing [[marginal product]]ivity of time and with [[time preference]].<ref>Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; ''Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales'' (1889). Translated as ''Capital and Interest.

Marshall constructed the demand curve with the aid of assumptions that utility was quantified, and that the marginal utility of money was constant (or nearly so).  Like Jevons, Marshall did not see an explanation for supply in the theory of marginal utility, so he synthesized an explanation of demand thus explained with supply explained in a more [[Classical economics|classical]] manner, determined by costs which were taken to be objectively determined.  (Marshall later actively mischaracterized the criticism that these costs were themselves ultimately determined by marginal utilities.<ref>[[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter, Joseph Alois]]; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) p 922-3.</ref>)  ==== The Marginal Revolution and Marxism ====  In his critique of [[political economy]], Marx discussed “use-value”, a concept analogous to utility: :A use-value has value only in use, and is realized only in the process of consumption. One and the same use-value can be used in various ways. But the extent of its possible application is limited by its existence as an object with distinct properties. It is, moreover, determined not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Different use-values have different measures appropriate to their physical characteristics; for example, a bushel of wheat, a quire of paper, a yard of linen.<ref>Marx, Karl; [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/ch01.htm ''Critique of Political Economy''] ([[1859]]).</ref> [[image:1Bawerk.gif|thumb|right|110px|Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] He acknowledged that the value of a commodity is dependent on the use that can be garnered from it,<ref>Marx, Karl; [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/f239-289.htm ''Grundrisse''] (completed in [[1857]] though not published until much later).</ref> but, in his analysis, utility was considered as all or nothing; it was unnecessary to describe variable use-value; to Marx labor was the ultimate source of value.  The doctrines of marginalism and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as somehow a response to [[Marxism|Marxist economics]].  In fact, the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' was not published until [[1867]], after the works of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were written or well under way; and Marx was still a relatively obscure figure when these works were completed.  It is unlikely that any of them knew anything of him. (On the other hand, [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] or [[William Warren Bartley|Bartley]] has suggested that [[Karl Marx|Marx]], voraciously reading at the [[British Museum]], may have come across the works of one or more of these figures, and that his inability to formulate a viable critique may account for his failure to complete any further volumes of ''Kapital'' before his death.<ref>Hayek, Friedrich August von, with [[William Warren Bartley|William Warren Bartley III]]; ''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism'' (1988) p150.</ref>)  Nonetheless, it is not unreasonable to suggest that part of what contributed to the success of the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution was their ability to formulate straight-forward responses to Marxist economic theory.  The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, “Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems” ([[1896]]),<ref>Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; “Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems” (NOWIKI)“On the Closure of the Marxist System”(NOWIKI), ''Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für [[Karl Knies|K. Knies]]'' ([[1896]]).</ref> but the first was Wicksteed's “The Marxian Theory of Value.

Only a few Marxist replies were made to marginalism, of which the most famous were [[Rudolf Hilferding]]'s ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' ([[1904]])<ref>Hilferding, Rudolf; ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' ([[1904]]).

Later work attempted to generalize the indifference-curve formulation of utility and marginal utility.   In [[1915]], [[Eugen Slutsky|Евгений Евгениевич Слуцкий (Eugen Slutsky)]] derived a theory of consumer choice solely from properties of indifference curves.<ref>[[Eugen Slutsky|Слуцкий, Евгений Евгениевич (Slutsky, Eugen E.)]]; “Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore”, ''Giornale degli Economisti'' 51 ([[1915]]).</ref>  Because of [[World War I|the World War]], the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], and his own subsequent loss of interest, Slutsky's work drew almost no notice, but similar work in [[1934]] by [[John Hicks|John Richard Hicks]] and [[R. G. D. Allen]]<ref>Hicks, John Richard, and Roy George Douglas Allen; “A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value”, ''Economica'' 54 ([[1934]]).</ref> derived much the same results and found a significant audience. (Allen subsequently drew attention to Slutsky's earlier accomplishment.)  Although some of the third generation of Austrian School economists had by [[1911]] rejected the quantification of utility while continuing to think in terms of marginal utility,<ref name="mises" /> most economists presumed that utility must be a sort of quantity.  Indifference curve analysis seemed to represent a way of dispensing with presumptions of quantification, albeït that a seemingly arbitrary assumption (admitted by Hicks to be a “rabbit out of a hat”<ref>Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. “Utility and Preference” §8, p23 in the 2nd edition.</ref>) about decreasing marginal rates of substitution<ref name="hicks_vc">Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. “Utility and Preference” §7-8.</ref> would then have to be introduced to have convexity of indifference curves.  For those who accepted that indifference curve analysis superseded marginal utility analysis, the latter became at best perhaps pedagogically useful, but “old fashioned” and ultimately incorrect.<ref name="hicks_vc" /><ref name="samuelson">Samuelson, Paul Anthony; “Complementarity: An Essay on the 40th Anniversary of the Hicks-Allen Revolution in Demand Theory”, ''Journal of Econmic Literature'' vol 12 (1974).</ref>  === Revival === [[Image:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|105px|John v.

The marginalists of the revolution, however, had been formally concerned with problems in which there was neither [[risk]] nor [[uncertainty]].  So too with the indifference curve analysis of Slutsky, Hicks, and Allen.  The [[expected utility hypothesis]] of Bernoulli ''et alii'' was revived by various [[20th century]] thinkers, with early contributions by [[Frank P.

Blackwell Publishing.</ref> In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of “[[Prudence (economics)|prudence]]”, which means [[convex function|convex]] marginal utility.<ref>Kimball, Miles (1990), “Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large”, ''[[Econometrica]]'', 58 (1) pp. 53-73.</ref>   Meanwhile, the Austrian School continues to develop its ordinalist notions of marginal utility analysis, formally demonstrating that from them proceed the decreasing marginal rates of substitution of indifference curves.<ref name="mc_culloch" />  == References == :''See also works named in body of article.'' {{reflist|2}}    == See also ==  *[[Economics]] *[[Microeconomics]] *[[Diminishing returns]] *[[Utility]] *[[Marginalism]] *[[Human nature]] *[[Economic subjectivism]]  [[Category:Marginal concepts]] [[Category:Consumer theory]] [[Category:Utility]] [[Category:Welfare economics]] [[Category:History of economic thought]]  [[ar:منفعة حدية]] [[cs:Mezní užitek]] [[de:Nutzenfunktion]] [[es:Utilidad marginal]] [[fa:مطلوبیت]] [[fr:utilité marginale]] [[ja:限界効用]] [[ko:한계효용]] [[id:Utilitas]] [[he:תועלת שולית]] [[lo:ຜົນປະໂຫຍດ]] [[lt:Mažėjančio naudingumo taisyklė]] [[hu:Hasznossági függvény]] [[pl:Użyteczność krańcowa]] [[pt:Lei da utilidade marginal]] [[ro:Funcţie de utilitate]] [[ru:Предельная полезность]] [[sk:Marginalizmus]] [[vi:Thỏa dụng]] [[uk:Гранична корисність]]
