   Greenwich  is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. In 2006 Greenwich ranked  #1 in the "Biggest Earner" category. As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 61,171. As of a census done by the Census Bureau on July 1, 2012, the town had a population of 62,256. It is home to many hedge funds and other financial service companies. Greenwich is the southernmost and westernmost municipality in Connecticut and New England. It is 38+ minutes by train (express) from Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. The largest town on Connecticut's Gold Coast, CNN/Money and Money magazine ranked Greenwich first on its list of the "100 Best Places to Live in the United States" in 2005.  The town is named after Greenwich, a borough of London in the United Kingdom.    The town of Greenwich was settled in 1640.  One of the founders was Elizabeth Fones Winthrop, daughter-in-law of John Winthrop, founder and Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. What is now called Greenwich Point was known for much of the area's early history as "Elizabeth's Neck" in recognition of Elizabeth Fones and their 1640 purchase of the Point and much of the area now known as Old Greenwich. Greenwich was declared a township by the General Assembly in Hartford on May 11, 1665.[ ] Greenwich history page at Connecticut GenWeb site. During the American Revolution, General Israel Putnam made a daring escape from the British on February 26, 1779. Although British forces pillaged the town, Putnam was able to warn Stamford. In 1974, Gulliver's Restaurant and Bar, on the border of Greenwich and Port Chester, burned killing 24 young people. In 1983, the Mianus River Bridge, which carries traffic on Interstate 95 over an estuary, collapsed, resulting in the death of three people. For many years, Greenwich Point (locally termed "Tod's Point"), was open only to town residents and their guests. However, a lawyer sued, saying his rights to freedom of assembly were threatened because he was not allowed to go there. The lower courts disagreed, but the Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed, and Greenwich was forced to amend its beach access policy to all four beaches.[ ] Leydon v. Greenwich, 257 Conn. 318, 777 A.2d 552 (2001).   According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which  is land and , or 28.88%, is water. In terms of area, Greenwich is twice the size of Manhattan. The town is bordered to the west and north by Westchester County, New York, to the east by the city of Stamford, and to the south by Long Island Sound.  The Census Bureau recognizes seven CDPs within the town: Byram, Cos Cob, Glenville, Old Greenwich, Pemberwick, Riverside, and a "Greenwich" CDP covering a portion of town. The USPS lists separate zip codes for Greenwich, Cos Cob, Old Greenwich, and Riverside. Additionally, Greenwich is often further divided into several smaller, unofficial neighborhoods. The Hispanic population is concentrated in the southwestern corner of the town. In 2011, numerous neighborhoods were voted by the Business Insider as being the richest neighborhoods in America. Greenwich is covered by five ZIP codes: Greenwich is covered by two area codes: Area code 203 is overlaid by area code 475. Calf Island, a  island about  from the Byram shore in Greenwich, is open for visitors, although as of the summer of 2006 it was getting relatively few of them."Upgrades make Calf Island more attractive to visitors", by Michael Dinan, "Greenwich Time", and "The Advocate" of Stamford, August 15, 2006, page 4, "The Advocate" More than half of the island (on the west side) is a bird sanctuary off-limits to members of the public without permission to visit. The island is available for overnight stays for those with permits, otherwise the east side is open from dawn till dusk. Great Captain Island is also off the coast of Greenwich, and is the southernmost point in Connecticut.  There is a Coast Guard lighthouse on this island, as well as a designed area as a bird sanctuary.  The lighthouse is a Skeletal Tower. Island Beach or "Little Captain Island" once was the venue for the town's annual Island Beach Day. Ventriloquist Paul Winchell and his dummy, Jerry Mahoney, once came for a show, and on another occasion the National Guard let adults and children fire machine guns into the water, according to an article in the Greenwich Time."Crew member passes on stories about island", by Michael Dinan, an article in the Greenwich Time August 7, 2006.  When the public first began visiting this island, a casino existed here. Island Beach has changed over the decades. The bathhouse once on the island's eastern shore is gone, and erosion is slowly eating away at the beaches themselves. Greenwich experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa).  However, it is quite close to a humid continental climate.  During winter storms, it is common for the area north of the Merritt Parkway to receive significantly heavier snowfall than the area closer to the coast, due to the moderating influence of Long Island Sound.   As of the census of 2000, there were 61,101 people, 23,230 households, and 16,237 families residing in the town.  The population density was 1,277.6 people per square mile (493.2/km²).  There were 24,511 housing units at an average density of 512.5 per square mile (197.9/km²). As of the census of 2013, the racial makeup of the town was 80.90% White, 4.90% African American, 0.10% Native American, 7.80% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, and 2.50% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 13.90% of the population. There were 23,230 households out of which 33.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.4% were married couples living together, 8.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.1% were non-families. 24.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.60 and the average family size was 3.12. In the town the population was spread out with 25.4% under the age of 18, 4.1% from 18 to 24, 28.8% from 25 to 44, 25.7% from 45 to 64, and 15.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females there were 90.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.2 males. The median income for a household in the town was $124,958, and the median income for a family was $167,825. Males had a median income of $95,085 versus $47,806 for females. The per capita income for the town was $92,759 per 2010 census. About 2.5% of families and 4.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.1% of those under age 18 and 3.2% of those age 65 or over. Both the Official AENGLC Wealth Value and the CPR AENGLC Wealth Value show Greenwich as having the highest wealth value in Connecticut at over $930,000 per person. The AENGLC is based on the value of residential and commercial real estate and measures the town's tax base available to pay for public education(see Conn. Dep of Ed). It is not a measure of the personal wealth of individual residents. New Canaan is the wealthiest town in Connecticut, with a per capita income of $100,824, second is Darien at $95,577 and Greenwich third at $92,759 per the 2010 Census. Median family income in New Canaan at $220,278 also is higher than Greenwich at $167,825. Greenwich was the highest income place with a population of 50,000 or more in 2000. However, using the list of the 100 richest places in the United States with at least 1,000 households yields a different result. This is the most common list used for referring to the richest communities in the country, as it eliminates any places with unsubstantial populations. On this list Greenwich ranks 56th after New Canaan at 30th, Darien at 42nd, and Weston at 55th. The median price for a single-family home in town was $1.7 million in 2006, when about 140 properties sold for $5 million or more, according to Prudential Connecticut Realty. In 2007, the highest asking prices for residential property in town were $39.5 million for the  estate of actor Mel Gibson on Old Mill Road, $19.7 million for a  mansion on  with a private lake, and $38 million for an estate with formal gardens and a greenhouse the size of a cottage.Crenson, Sharon L., "Gibson selling Greenwich estate for $39.5M", Bloomberg News, article appeared in The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, July 12, 2007, pA2 The town of Greenwich is one political and taxing body, but consists of several distinct sections or neighborhoods, such as Banksville, Byram, Cos Cob, Glenville, Mianus, Old Greenwich, Riverside and Greenwich (sometimes referred to as central, or downtown, Greenwich). Of these neighborhoods, three (Cos Cob, Old Greenwich, and Riverside) have separate postal names and ZIP codes. The town has three Selectmen and a Representative Town Meeting (RTM). The RTM must approve all budgets, and consists of 230 elected representatives. RTM members are not paid.  The three selectmen are elected on a town-wide basis, although each person can only vote for two members. This assures that there will almost always be one Democrat and two Republicans or two Democrats and one Republican. While voter registration is skewed in the Republicans' favor, they do not have a lock on the First Selectman's chair, and Democrats have held the seat recently. Many of the other town committees have equal representation between Democrats and Republicans, regardless of the vote breakdown, since each individual can only vote for half as many seats as are available. In 2005, the mill rate for Greenwich was 7.5Connecticut Mill Rates - Courant.com and is reportedly 11.01 for the 2012–2013 fiscal year.http://www.greenwichct.org/upload/medialibrary/48a/Mill_Rate_Summary_12-13.pdf Greenwich Emergency Medical Service, Inc.

The 3 middle schools have balanced enrollment. There is a Connecticut racial diversity law which requires that the percentage of students in an ethnic group in a school may not deviate by more than 25% from the average for the district. Thus, as of 2013, the district was out of compliance and was searching for solutions.

Two bridges in Greenwich were among 12 in the state listed in "critical" condition by state safety inspectors as of August 2007. The Riversville Road bridge, built in the 1950s, now has a weight limit of 3 tons, but as of August 5, 2007, the bridge had not been inspected in over two years (in March 2005), according to state records obtained by the Hartford Courant, although a state official said the bridge was inspected in August 2005 and would be inspected again in August 2007. In the March 2005 inspection, the bridge's above-ground structure was deemed to be in critical condition, with other components in poor condition.  The Bailiwick Road bridge in town was closed in April 2007 and remained closed as of August 2007 due to storm damage. The ratings for the two bridges were worse than the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis, which collapsed during rush hour on August 1, 2007.Kaplan, Thomas, Martineau, Kim, and Kauffman, Matthew, "12 state bridges are judged to be in critical condition" article in The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, article reprinted from The Hartford Courant, August 5, 2007, pp1, A6 According to the DataHaven Community Wellbeing Survey, a statewide program funded by various agencies and philanthropies, 4% of adults in Greenwich are "transportation insecure," meaning that they have had to stay at home during the past year due to a lack of adequate transportation.
