    Raëlism, also known as Raëlianism or the Raëlian movement, is a UFO religion that was founded in 1974 by Claude Vorilhon, now known as Raël. An adherent of Raëlism is a Raëlian. The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human when having personal contacts with the descendants of the humans that they made. They previously misinformed (on purpose) early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and othersNickerson, Colin, CANADIAN CULT SAYS FIRST HUMAN CLONE IS NEAR BIRTH, Boston Globe. 20 December 2002.

The Raëlian Church has a quasi-clerical structure of seven levels. Joining the movement requires an official apostasy from other religions. Raëlian ethics include striving for world peace, sharing, democracy and nonviolence.Susan J. Palmer (2004). Aliens adored: Raël's UFO religion, Page 62 Sexuality is also an important part of the Raëlian doctrine. The Raëlian Church, with its liberal views of sexuality, has attracted some of its priests and bishops from other religions. Raël founded Clonaid (originally Valiant Venture Ltd Corporation) in 1997, but then handed it over to a Raëlian bishop, Brigitte Boisselier in 2000.Clonaid Homepage: History Retrieved 26 March 2008. In 2002 the company claimed that an American woman underwent a standard cloning procedure that led to the birth of a daughter, Eve (b. 26 December 2002). Although few believe the claim, it nonetheless attracted national authorities and the mainstream media to look further into the Raëlians' cult status. The Raëlians frequently use the swastika as a symbol of peace, which halted Raëlian requests for territory in Israel, and later Lebanon, for establishing an embassy for extraterrestrials.  The religion also uses the swastika embedded on the Star of David.http://altreligion.about.com/od/symbols/ig/Raelian-Symbols/Official-Raelian-Symbol.htm  Starting around 1991, this symbol was often replaced by a variant star and swirl symbol as a public relations move, particularly toward Israel.   The beginnings of Raëlism are rooted in the claims of a French former automobile journalist and race car driver Claude Vorilhon. In his books The Book Which Tells the Truth (1974) and Extraterrestrials Took Me to their    Planet (1975), Vorilhon alleges that he had alien encounters with beings who gave him knowledge of the origins of all major religions. The movement traces its beginnings to a conference in Paris, France of two thousand people in 1974.Rael: Messenger of the Elohim, The International Raelian Movement. Retrieved 1 December 2006. From there, the MADECH organization was born. The name MADECH is a double acronym in the French language; it stands both for "Movement for the Welcoming of the Elohim, Creators of Humanity" (Mouvement pour l‘accueil des Elohim, créateurs de l'humanité) and for "Moses Preceded Elijah and the Christ" (Moise a devancé Élie et le Christ).

On 26 December 2002, Brigitte Boisselier, a Raëlian Bishop and CEO of a biotechnology company called Clonaid announced the birth of baby Eve, supposedly the first-ever human clone. The announcement ignited much media attention, ethical debate, doubt, criticism, and claims of a hoax. Spokespeople for the movement, including Claude Vorilhon, have suggested that this is one of the first steps in achieving a more important agenda. They claim that through cloning they can combine an accelerated growth process with some form of mind transfer, and in such, may achieve eternal life.THE CLONING DEBATE, MacNeil/Lehrer Productions. 27 December 2002.

The major initiation rite in the Raëlian Church is the "baptism" or "transmission of the cellular plan" and is performed by upper-level members in the Raëlian clergy known as guides. In 1979, Raël introduced the "Act of Apostasy" as an obligation for those preparing for their Raëlian baptism.Paredes, Noelle, The Raelians: Roots, beliefs and future plans, CTV Television Network. 27 December 2002.

This Raëlian baptism involves a guide member laying water onto the forehead of the new member.  The practice began on "the first Sunday in April" of 1976 when Raël baptised 40 Raëlians.  Raëlians believe that their genetic information is recorded by a remote computer and would become recognized during their final hour when they will be judged by the extraterrestrial Elohim. Baptisms can only be performed on four special days in the year. The dates mark anniversaries in the Raëlian calendar. The dates are the 6 August, which marks the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, 13 December, marking the day that Raël in 1973 says he had his first personal encounter with one of the extraterrestrial Elohim, 7 October in which the Elohim, Raël says, took him up in a spacecraft in 1975 and the following day had meals with Jesus, Buddha, and other past religious figures  and the first Sunday in April, which Raëlians believe is the date when dark-skinned extraterrestrials created Adam and Eve.RaelAfrica.org, RaelAfrica.org.

Raëlians believe that throughout the ages, members of the Elohim civilization sent different prophets, including Moses, Jesus, Buddha and many others whose role was guide humanity and to prepare humans for the future, all of whom were created as a result of a sexual union between a human woman and one of the Elohim. To Raëlians, this was possible because the Elohim had advanced DNA synthesis and genetic engineering.

Sometimes, they will not attend monthly meetings or pay a tithe in proportion to their income. Only the more committed members who do follow such rules can remain in the movement's structure. According to Michel Beluet, the former director of a Raëlian-built museum called UFOland, the only pressure exerted on members is to attend annual Raëlian seminars, which allows members convinced of Raël's enthusiasm to voluntarily tithe.

Dawson College students conducted a survey of the membership in Canada 1991 which found that only one-third of respondents tithed.

In Raëlian cosmology, our observable universe is an "atom" of a much larger level of matter (and possibly organism) and subatomic particles in our bodies also possess universes like our own, but on a much smaller scale.  This pattern, atom within universe within atom, is believed to be infinitely repetitive, from the infinitely small, to the infinitely large.  The Raëlian Messages by Raël state that humanoid extraterrestrials, who were originally called under the name Elohim (singular: Eloha), verified this cosmology scientifically. Because of the difference of mass, the activity of life inside in a living thing's atoms would undergo many millennia before enough time passes for that living thing to take a single step.  Raëlians believe the universe is infinite in time and space and lacks a center. Because of this, one could not imagine where an ethereal soul would go. The Raëlian cosmology is meditated upon during the fourth activity in the rite of Sensual Meditation. In his book The Message Given to me by Extraterrestrials (now republished as Intelligent Design: Message from the Designers 2006 ISBN 2-940252-20-3), Claude Vorilhon claims that on 13 December 1973, he found a spacecraft shaped like a flattened bell that landed inside Puy de Lassolas, a volcano near the capital city of Auvergne. A 25,000-year-old human-like extraterrestrial inside the spacecraft named Yahweh said that Elohim was the name that primitive people of Earth called members of his extraterrestrial race—who were seen as "those who came from the sky". Yahweh explained that Earth was originally void of life, with thick clouds and shallow seas, but the Elohim came, broke apart the clouds, exposed the seas to sunlight, built a continent, and synthesized a global ecosystem. Solar astronomy, terraformation, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering allowed Elohim to adapt life to Earth's thermal and chemical makeup. Yahweh gave materialistic explanations of the following: According to Vorilhon, Elohim contacted about forty people to act as their prophets on Earth, including Moses,  Elijah, Ezekiel, Buddha, John the Baptist, Jesus, Muhammad, and Joseph Smith. The religions thought to be from Elohimic origins include Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Mormonism. From the Raëlian point of view, religious texts indicate that the Elohim would return at the age of Apocalypse or Revelation (unveiling of the truth). Humans from another world would appear to drop down from the sky and meet in the embassy they have asked Raël to build for them and share their advanced scientific knowledge with humanity.  Thus, one of their stated main goals of the Raëlian movement is to inform as many people as possible about this extraterrestrial race."An Embassy for Extraterrestrials", International Raëlian Movement. Retrieved 20 July 2007. Raëlians believe that humanity would be able to create life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation would have a better chance of both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators.  Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life. Raëlians do not believe that an ethereal soul exists free of physical confinement. Raëlians believe that advanced supercomputers of the Elohim are right now recording the memories and DNA of human beings. When Elohim release this information for the coming resurrection, people would be brought back from the dead and the judgments upon them would be realized based on actions in their past life. People excluded from physical recreation would include those who achieved nothing positive but were not evil.  Vorilhon expressed an interest in cloning Hitler for war trials and retroactive punishment."Cult Bids to Clone Hitler for War Trial", Daily Record. 9 August 2001. Retrieved 18 September 2007.

The funding of the embassy has been reported over time by the media.  Its location is intended to be in neutral territory, preferably Jerusalem, and would be surrounded by acres of campground capable of supporting about 144,000 people or more than twice the estimated Raëlian membership as of 2005.

In the plan are seven rooms for the purpose of receiving human guests into the embassy.  The embassy building, along with the swimming pool, would be in the center of a large park and protected from trespassing by a wall−a maximum of two stories-to surround the entire complex's circumference.  Trees and bushes are to be planted in the outskirts of the wall's area.  The walls are to have a northern and southern entrance.  The landing pad for the embassy should be able fit a spaceship of twelve meters of diameter or 39'4" on its terrace.  The terrace is to be above the rooms in the torus, which are for extraterrestrials only.  The seven rooms directly underneath the landing pad would be protected from occupants of other rooms with a thick metal door.  Finally, the International Raëlian Movement wants to avoid military and radar surveillance of the airspace above the embassy.  Buildings for administration, food and water provisions, and state-of-the-art sanitation and communication systems are part of this vision.ELOHIM'S INSTRUCTIONS, International Raëlian Movement.

Retrieved 17 July 2007. In his book Geniocracy, Raël outlined his plan for a peaceful worldwide political union that, while democratic, would require members of the electorate to meet a minimum standard of intelligence. The thresholds proposed by the Raëlians are 50% above average for a candidate and 10% above average for a voter.Rael, Geniocracy The world government would also have a global currency, a common language, and a transformation of militaries of the world into civil police. Raelians deride the current state-system as inadequate for dealing with contemporary global issues that are typical of Globalisation, such as Environmentalism, Social Justice, Human Rights, and the current economic system. In line with this, Geniocracy proposes a different economic model called Humanitarianism. Raël recommends a world government with 12 regions.  Inhabitants would vote for which region they want to be part of.  After the regions are defined, they are further divided into 12 sectors after the same principle of democracy is applied.  While sectors of the same region are defined as having equal numbers of inhabitants, the regions themselves may have different levels of population, which would be proportional to its voting power. The current difficulty in the ideas of Geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill-defined. One idea offered by Rael in Geniocracy is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing ones, a series of tests that would define each person's level of intelligence. They should be designed to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge. The lack of scientific rigour necessary for inclusion of Geniocracy as properly testable political ideology can be noted in number of modern and historical dictatorships as well as oligarchies.  Because of the controversies surrounding Geniocracy, Raël presents the idea as a classic utopia or provocative ideal and not necessarily a model that humanity will follow. In Raël's book, Extraterrestrials took me to their planet, Raël claims that an extraterrestrial gave him the idea of Economic Humanitarianism. Under the establishment of Economic Humanitarianism, people would not have ownership of businesses or exploitable goods created by others. Instead, people would rent each of them for a period of 49 years. The founders would be able to receive the rents for up to 49 years or when they die, whichever is later. Any rents not inherited by relatives after 49 years would go to the State.  By balancing inheritances, children would be born with enough financial means to forsake menial tasks for endeavors that may benefit the whole of humanity.  Family houses could be inherited from generation to generation, free of rent. In his much later book, Maitreya, Raël says the road to a world without money is capitalism and globalisation, as opposed to communism.  Capitalism would allow those who contribute much to society to also contribute to its scientific and technological development. Under capitalism, society would produce as much money as it can.  The money would become important in the short run as nanotechnology quickly lowers the cost of goods while putting many people out of work.  Raelians believe in reclaiming the swastika by restoring its historical meaning as a symbol of peace and good luck.Pro-Swastika, Pro-Swastika.org. 2008. Retrieved 10 April 2008. Swastika has been used for millennia in the East as a religious symbol of peace and harmony. In 1991, a Montreal anti-cult organization called Info-Cult made statements against the Raëlian Church with an article on Le Devoir, branding Raëlians as promoters of fascism and racism, due to the church's use of the swastika as part of their logo and the Raëlian description of an extraterrestrial global government in which those less than ten percent above average intelligence are excluded from the electorate. Outside Info-Cult's office, Raëlians spoke against the act of discriminating against a religious minority. On 2 January 1992, a dozen people protested against the use of the swastika in the Raëlian logo in Miami's Eden Roc Hotel. The use of the swastika and other Raelian practices has led to criticism from the group Hineni of Florida, a Jewish anti-cult organization.USE OF SWASTIKA LOGO PROMPTS BEACH PROTEST, The Miami Herald. 3 January 1992.
