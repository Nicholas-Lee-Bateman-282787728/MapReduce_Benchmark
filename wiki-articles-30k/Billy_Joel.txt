In 2001, Joel received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2013, Joel received the Kennedy Center Honors, the nation's highest honor for influencing American culture through the arts. With the exception of the 2007 songs "All My Life" and "Christmas in Fallujah", Joel stopped writing and releasing pop/rock material after 1993's River of Dreams. However, he continues to tour, and he plays songs from all eras of his solo career in his concerts. William Martin Joel was born in the Bronx on May 9, 1949, and was raised in a Levitt house in a section of Levittown, New York that was located in the town of Oyster Bay. In 1963, when ZIP codes were assigned, the section of Levittown in Oyster Bay was given a Hicksville, New York ZIP code and has since been part of Hicksville. Joel's father, Howard (born Helmuth) Joel, a classical pianist, was born in Germany, the son of a Jewish merchant and manufacturer, Karl Amson Joel. Howard emigrated to Switzerland and later to the US (via Cuba, as immigration quotas for German Jews prevented direct immigration at the time) to escape the Nazi regime. Joel's mother, Rosalind, was born in England to Jewish parents, Philip and Rebecca Nyman. Rosalind and Howard Joel divorced in 1957. Howard Joel moved to Vienna, Austria. Billy Joel has a sister, Judith, and a half-brother, Alexander Joel, a classical conductor in Europe, who was the chief musical director of the Staatstheater Braunschweig from 2001 to 2014.Tallmer, Jerry (July 16–22, 2003).

As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so he could defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, winning 22 bouts, but abandoned the sport shortly after his nose was broken in his 24th boxing match. Joel attended Hicksville High School until 1967, but he did not graduate with his class. He had been playing at a piano bar to help his mother make ends meet, which interfered with his attendance; specifically, he missed a crucial English exam, as he had been playing a late-night gig at a piano bar the evening before."Billy Joel Interview." The Charlie Rose Show. PBS, 1993. Though Joel was a comparatively strong student, at the end of his senior year, he did not have enough credits to graduate. Rather than attend summer school to earn his diploma, Joel decided to begin a career in music: "I told them, 'To hell with it. If I'm not going to Columbia University, I'm going to Columbia Records, and you don't need a high school diploma over there'."Bordowitz, Hank. Billy Joel: The Life and Times of an Angry Young Man. 2006: 22 Joel eventually signed with Columbia. In 1992, he submitted essays to the school board and was awarded his diploma at Hicksville High's annual graduation ceremony, 25 years after leaving. Influenced by early rock and roll and rhythm and blues artists, including groups such as The Beatles, The Drifters and The Four Seasons, and eschewing overkill, he favored tightly structured pop melodies and down-to-earth, unpretentious songwriting.Tamarkin, Jeff. "Joel, Billy." Oxford Music Online [Oxford UP]. Oxford University Press, n.d. Web. October 5, 2015. After seeing The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, Joel decided to pursue a career in music. In an interview he said of the group's impact, "That one performance changed my life … Up to that moment I'd never considered playing rock as a career. And when I saw four guys who didn't look like they'd come out of the Hollywood star mill, who played their own songs and instruments, and especially because you could see this look in John Lennon's face – and he looked like he was always saying: 'F--- you!' – I said: 'I know these guys, I can relate to these guys, I am these guys.' This is what I'm going to do – play in a rock band'."Crandall, Bill. "10 musicians who saw the Beatles standing there". CBS News, February 6, 2014. Joel joined the Echoes, a group that specialized in British Invasion covers. The Echoes began recording in 1965; Joel was originally hired by Snuff Garrett as a pianist for Bobby Vee. Joel (then 16) also played piano on several records released through Kama Sutra Productions and on recordings produced by Shadow Morton. Joel played on a demo version of "Leader of the Pack", which would become a major hit for the Shangri-Las.Joel with Howard Stern on Sirius Radio Bluebird Reviews! November 24, 2010. Retrieved March 2, 2014. Joel states that in 1964 he played on a recording of the Shangri-Las' "Remember (Walking in the Sand)" but he is unaware of whether he played on the demo or master version; The released single included a co-producer credit for Artie Ripp, who later was the first to sign Joel as a solo artist after Michael Lang, who had given Joel a monetary advance, passed Joel along to Ripp to focus his attentions elsewhere instead. In late 1965, the Echoes changed their name to the Emeralds and then to the Lost Souls. Joel left the band in 1967 to join the Hassles, a Long Island group that had signed with United Artists Records.Joel, Billy. [ ]. Oxford Music Online, June 15, 2015. Over the next year and a half they released four singles and two albums (The Hassles and Hour of the Wolf). All were commercial failures. Joel and drummer Jon Small left the Hassles in 1969 to form the duo Attila, releasing an eponymous debut album in July 1970. The duo disbanded the following October when Joel began an affair with Small's wife, Elizabeth, whom Joel eventually married. Joel signed a contract with the record company Family Productions (owned by Artie Ripp but backed by Gulf + Western), with which he recorded his first solo album, Cold Spring Harbor (a reference to Cold Spring Harbor, New York, a town on Long Island). Ripp states that he spent $450,000 developing Joel; nevertheless, the album was mastered at the wrong speed and as a result, the album was a technical and commercial disappointment. The popular songs "She's Got a Way" and "Everybody Loves You Now" were originally released on this album, but went largely unnoticed until being released as live performances on Songs in the Attic (1981). Columbia released a remastered version of Cold Spring Harbor in 1983. Joel began his Cold Spring Harbor tour in the fall of 1971, touring with his band (Rhys Clark on drums, Al Hertzberg on guitar, and Larry Russell on bass guitar) throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico, opening for groups such as the J. Geils Band, The Beach Boys, and Taj Mahal. Joel's performance at the Puerto Rican Mar Y Sol Pop Festival was especially well-received; interest in his music grew. During the spring of 1972, the Philadelphia radio station WMMR-FM began playing a concert recording of "Captain Jack", which became an underground hit on the East Coast. Herb Gordon, a Columbia Records executive, heard Joel's music and introduced him to the company. Joel signed a recording contract with Columbia in 1972 and moved to Los Angeles, California; he lived there for the next three years.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas (2006). "[ Billy Joel Biography]. AllMusic. Retrieved on December 7, 2008. For six months he worked at The Executive Room piano bar on Wilshire Boulevard as "Bill Martin," composing his signature hit "Piano Man" about the bar's patrons.  Despite Joel's new contract, he was still legally bound to Family Productions. Artie Ripp sold Joel's first contract to Columbia. Walter Yetnikoff, the president of CBS/Columbia Records at the time, bought back the rights to Joel's songs in the late 1970s, giving the rights to Joel as a birthday gift.The Last Play at Shea (documentary film). 2010. Interview with Yetnikoff.The Last Play at Shea (2010). October 28, 2010. New York Times. Yetnikoff notes in the documentary film The Last Play at Shea that he had to threaten Ripp to close the deal. Joel's first album with Columbia was Piano Man, released in 1973. Despite modest sales, Piano Man's title track became his signature song, ending nearly every concert. That year Joel's touring band changed. Guitarist Al Hertzberg was replaced by Don Evans, and bassist Larry Russell by Patrick McDonald, himself replaced in late 1974 by [[Doug Stegmeyer]], who would stay with Joel until 1989. Rhys Clark returned as drummer and Tom Whitehorse as banjoist and pedal steel player; Johnny Almond joined as saxophonist and keyboardist. The band toured the US and Canada extensively, appearing on popular music shows. Joel's songwriting began attracting more attention; in 1974 [[Helen Reddy]] recorded "You're My Home" (''Piano Man'').  Joel recorded a second album in Los Angeles: ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]''. His manager was Jon Troy, an old friend from the New York neighborhood of [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]]. Troy would soon be replaced by Joel's wife Elizabeth.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chesher Cat |url=http://everybodyishotisdead.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_archive.html |title=Everybody I Shot is Dead |publisher=everybodyishotisdead.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> ''Streetlife Serenade ''contains references to [[suburbia]] and the [[inner city]]. It is perhaps best known for "[[The Entertainer (song)|The Entertainer]]", a No. 34 hit in the US. Upset that "Piano Man" had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote "The Entertainer" as a sarcastic response: "If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05." Although ''Streetlife Serenade'' is often considered one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel dislikes it himself), it contains the notable songs "Los Angelenos" and "[[Root Beer Rag]]", an [[instrumental]] that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s.  In late 1975, he played piano and organ on several tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album.  Disenchanted with Los Angeles, Joel returned to New York City in 1976 and recorded ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'', the first album he recorded with the group of hand-picked musicians who became the [[Billy Joel Band]]. Produced by [[James William Guercio]] (then [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s producer), ''Turnstiles'' was first recorded at [[Caribou Ranch]] with members of [[Elton John]]'s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.  "[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]" was a minor hit; [[Ronnie Spector]] recorded a cover as did [[Nigel Olsson]], then drummer with Elton John. (In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key "shreds" his [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]]; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014.) Though never released as a single, "[[New York State of Mind]]" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Tony Bennett]] have each recorded covers (Bennett's a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''). Other notable songs from the album include "[[Summer, Highland Falls]]", "[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]", "Say Goodbye to Hollywood", (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit), and "[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]]", a concert mainstay.  === ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' === Columbia Records introduced Joel to [[Phil Ramone]], who would produce all of Joel's studio albums from ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]] ''(1977) to ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986). ''The Stranger'' was an enormous commercial success, yielding four Top-25 hits on the ''Billboard'' charts: "[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]" (#3), "[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)|Movin' Out]]" (#17), "[[Only the Good Die Young]]" (#24), and "[[She's Always a Woman]]" (#17).

Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time. On the front cover of the album, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that "people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones").  ''Glass Houses'' spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard chart and yielded such hits as "[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]" (used as the theme song, covered by [[Southside Johnny]], for the CBS mid-1990s sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'') (#7, May 1980), "[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]" (#19, September 1980), "[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]" (#36, November 1980) and "[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]", which became Joel's first Billboard number-one single (for two weeks) in July 1980. "It's Still Rock and Roll to Me" spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and was the 7th biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40.  ''Glass Houses'' won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. It would also win the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, "Through The Long Night" ([[B-side]] of the "It's Still Rock & Roll to Me" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' "[[Yes It Is]]".<ref name="unauthorized" />  His next release, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded during larger US arenas and intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: "Say Goodbye to Hollywood" (#17), and "She's Got a Way" (#23). It sold over 3&nbsp;million copies. Though not as successful as some of his previous albums, the album was still considered a success by Joel.<ref name="unauthorized" />  The next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With ''The Nylon Curtain'', Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, trying his hand at writing topical songs like "Allentown" and "Goodnight Saigon". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Ronald_Reagan#First_term.2C_1981.E2.80.9385|Reagan years]] meant that "all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had."<ref name="ncvideo">{{cite video |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU |title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain&nbsp;– from The Complete Albums Collection |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to "create a sonic masterpiece" on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.<ref name="ncvideo" /> Work began on ''The Nylon Curtain'' in the fall of 1981 although Joel's work on the album was temporary delayed when he was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on [[Long Island]] on April 15, 1982. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album only ended up being delayed by a few weeks.  In 1982, he embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, ''Live from Long Island,'' which was recorded at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 30, 1982. It was originally broadcast on [[HBO]] in 1983 before it became available on VHS.  ''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles "[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]" and "[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]". "Allentown" spent six weeks at a peak position of No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982, pushing it into 1983's year-end Top 70, and making it the most successful song from ''The Nylon Curtain'' album, besting "Pressure" which peaked at No. 20 (where it resided for three weeks) and "[[Goodnight Saigon]]" which reached No. 56 on U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7694 |title=Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel|work= Songfacts |publisher=songfacts.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010 }}</ref>  === Christie Brinkley, ''An Innocent Man'', and ''The Bridge'' === [[File:An Innocent Man single.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Joel on the cover of the "An Innocent Man" EP, 1983]] Joel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone. The album ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, "[[Tell Her About It]]", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being "in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles."<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&nbsp;– Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>  At the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing "[[Uptown Girl]]" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).</ref><ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref> The song became a worldwide hit upon its release. The music video of the song featured [[Christie Brinkley]] as a high society girl, whose car pulls into the gas station that Joel's character is working in. At the end of the video, Joel's "grease monkey" character drives off with his "uptown girl" on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was "I don't dance". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. That began a relationship between the two that later led to their marriage. Also, the [[Wilson Pickett]]-inspired song "Easy Money" would be featured in the 1983 [[Easy Money (1983 film)|Rodney Dangerfield film]] of the same name.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  In December, the title song, "[[An Innocent Man (song)|An Innocent Man]]", was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, "The Longest Time" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, "[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]" was released and it hit No. 27 while "[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for "Keeping the Faith", Christie Brinkley also plays the "redhead girl in a Chevrolet". ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.  Joel participated in the [[USA For Africa]] ''[[We Are The World]]'' project in 1985, capping off a series of successful singles.  Following the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered "Greatest Hits" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs "[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]" and "[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively.  ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&nbsp;million copies (23&nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling album in American music history]], according to the RIAA.  Coinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, "Piano Man", for this project.  Though it broke into the top ten, Joel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits "[[A Matter of Trust]]" and "[[Modern Woman]]" from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both #10). In a departure from his "piano man" persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Les Paul]]-autographed Gibson guitar. The ballad "[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]" also charted, peaking at No. 18.  On November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song "[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]" was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled "Big Man on Mulberry Street".  ''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.  === Soviet Union trip === In October 1986, Joel and his handlers started planning a trip to the [[Soviet Union]]. He became one of the first American rock acts to play there since the [[Berlin Wall]] went up, a fact not lost on history buff Joel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html?8dpc=&_r=1&oref=login&pagewanted=print |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura|last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}</ref> There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]]. Joel and his family (including young daughter Alexa) and his full touring band made the trip in August 1987. The entourage was filmed for television and video to offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world.  Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel's energetic show, something that had never happened in other countries he had performed in. According to Joel, each time the fans were hit with the bright lights, anybody who seemed to be enjoying themselves froze. In addition, people who were "overreacting" were removed by security.<ref name=SeattelWeekly>{{cite web|title=Letters to the Editor (November 14, 2007).|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-11-14/news/letters-to-the-editor.php?page=full|website=Seattle Weekly|accessdate=December 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117165213/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-11-14/news/letters-to-the-editor.php?page=full|archivedate=January 17, 2008}}</ref> It was during this concert that Joel, enraged by the bright lights, flipped his piano and snapped a microphone stand while continuing to sing the current part of the set.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-27/news/mn-4135_1_billy-joel|title=Billy Joel Blows His Cool, Upsets Piano in Moscow|agency=Associated Press|date=July 27, 1987|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref> He later apologized for that incident.  The album ''[[Kohuept|КОНЦЕРТ]]'' (Russian for "Concert") was released in October 1987. Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like "An Innocent Man". Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than $1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.<ref name="unauthorized" />  === ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===  The release of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'' coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for $90&nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded $2&nbsp;million in a partial judgement against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a $30&nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>  The first single for the album, "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third and – to date – most-recent US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single "Just Wanna Hold"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].  ''Storm Front'''s second single, "[[I Go to Extremes]]" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song "[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and "[[The Downeaster Alexa]]", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad "[[And So It Goes]]" (#37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but "And So It Goes" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that "And So It Goes", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.  In the summer of 1992, Joel filed another $90&nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract<ref>{{cite news|first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&nbsp;– Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com:80/profiles/billy-joel |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}</ref>  In 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The eponymous first single was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits "[[All About Soul]]" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and "[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of "All About Soul" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).  The song "The Great Wall of China" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. "2000 Years" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and "Famous Last Words" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.  === Face-to-Face tours === Beginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of "Face to Face" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.<ref>[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel & Elton John]. tampabay.metromix.com.

It's always fun playing with him." However, in March 2012 he told an audience at the [[University of Florida]] that the Face to Face shows "got to be a little confining" because Elton John insisted that they keep playing the same sets. "I don't think we'll do it anymore," Joel said.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  === 1994–2007 === [[File:BillyJoel.jpg|right|thumb|Joel performing in 2007 in Florida]] On August 25, 1994, Joel and second wife [[Christie Brinkley]] divorced, but they remained friends.  1997's "[[To Make You Feel My Love]]" and "[[Hey Girl (Freddie Scott song)|Hey Girl]]" both charted from Joel's ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)#Greatest Hits Volume III|Greatest Hits Volume III]]'' album. Joel wrote and recorded the song "Shameless" that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, "Baby Grand" (a track on Joel's album ''The Bridge'' released in 1986).  On December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]" and "[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.  In 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Richard Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed "New York State of Mind" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with "[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed "[[Your Song]]" with [[Elton John]].  In 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song "[[Until the Night]]" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.  In 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternate versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix "Zanzibar" and a live version of "I Go to Extremes" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.  On January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like "Zanzibar" and "[[All for Leyna]]". His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 46 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released ''[[12 Gardens Live]]'', a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.  Joel visited the United Kingdom and Ireland for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour. On July 31, 2006, he performed a free concert in Rome, with the [[Colosseum]] as the backdrop. Organizers estimated 500,000 people turned out for the concert, which was opened by [[Bryan Adams]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Joel toured South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006, and subsequently toured the Southeastern U.S. in February and March 2007 before hitting the Midwest in the spring of 2007. On January 3 of that year, news was leaked to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that Billy had recorded a new song with lyrics—this being the first new song with lyrics he'd written in almost 14 years.<ref>Johnson, Richard (January 3, 2007).

The track was dedicated to servicemen based in Iraq. Joel wrote it in September 2007 after reading numerous letters sent to him from American soldiers in Iraq. "Christmas in Fallujah" is only the second pop/rock song released by Joel since 1993's ''River of Dreams''. Proceeds from the song benefited the Homes For Our Troops foundation.  === 2008–2012 === On January 26, 2008, Joel performed with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] celebrating the 151st anniversary of the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]]. Joel premiered his new classical piece titled, "Waltz No. 2 (Steinway Hall)" arranged by [[Brad Ellis]]. He also played many of his less well-known pieces, with full orchestral backing arranged by Mr. Ellis, including the rarely performed ''Nylon Curtain'' songs "Scandinavian Skies" and "Where's the Orchestra?".  On March 10, 2008, Joel inducted his friend [[John Mellencamp]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in a ceremony at the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.  Joel's staying power as a touring act continues to the present day. He sold out 10 concerts at the [[Mohegan Sun Casino]] in [[Uncasville, Connecticut]] from May to July 2008. The casino honored him with a banner displaying his name and the number 10 to hang in the arena. On June 19, 2008, he played a concert at the grand re-opening of [[Caesars Windsor]] (formerly Casino Windsor) in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada to an invite-only crowd for Casino VIPs. His mood was light, and joke-filled, even introducing himself as "Billy Joel's dad" and stating "you guys overpaid to see a fat bald guy". He also admitted that Canadian folk-pop musician [[Gordon Lightfoot]] was the musical inspiration for "She's Always A Woman".<ref>''[[The Windsor Star]]'', edition of June 20, 2008.{{which|date=October 2012|reason=Article title missing}}{{failed verification|date=October 2012}}</ref>  On July 16, 2008, and July 18, 2008, Joel played the final concerts at [[Shea Stadium]] before its demolition. His guests included [[Tony Bennett]], [[Don Henley]], [[John Mayer]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Steven Tyler]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Garth Brooks]], and [[Paul McCartney]]. The concerts were featured in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Last Play at Shea]]''. The film was released on DVD on February 8, 2011. The CD and DVD of the show, ''[[Live at Shea Stadium: The Concert|Live at Shea Stadium]]'' were released on March 8, 2011.  On December 11, 2008, Joel recorded his own rendition of "[[Christmas in Fallujah]]" during a concert at [[Acer Arena]] in Sydney and released it as a live single in Australia only. It is the only official release of Joel performing "Christmas in Fallujah," as Cass Dillon sang on the 2007 studio recording and the handful of times the song was played live in 2007. Joel sang the song throughout his December 2008 tour of Australia.  On May 19, 2009, Joel's former drummer, [[Liberty DeVitto]], filed a lawsuit in NYC claiming Joel and Sony Music owed DeVitto over 10 years of royalty payments. DeVitto had never been given songwriting or arranging credit on any of Joel's songs, but he claimed that he helped arrange some of them, including "Only the Good Die Young".<ref name="Joel's Former Drummer Sues for Payments">{{cite web | url = http://www.musicnewsnet.com/2009/05/billy-joels-former-drummer-to-file-lawsuit.html | title = Billy Joel's Former Drummer Files Lawsuit, Liberty DeVitto Says He's Owed $$$ | first = Mal | last = Westerly | publisher = MusicNewsNet.com | date = May 24, 2009 | accessdate = May 24, 2009}}</ref> In April 2010, it was announced that Joel and DeVitto amicably resolved the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.musicnewsnet.com/2010/04/billy-joel-and-former-drummer-liberty-devitto-settle-lawsuit.html | title = Billy Joel and Former Drummer, Liberty Devitto Settle Lawsuit | publisher = MusicNewsNet.com | date = April 22, 2010 | accessdate = April 25, 2010}}</ref>  2011 marked the 40th anniversary of the release of Joel's first album, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]].''

Under the agreement, UMPG and Rondor replaced EMI Music Publishing in handling Joel's catalog outside the U.S. Additionally, the agreement marked the first time since Joel regained control of his publishing rights in the 1980s that he began to use an administrator to handle his catalog within the U.S. The agreement's focus is on increasing the use of Joel's music in movies, television programs, and commercials.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Christman|first1=Ed|title=Exclusive: Billy Joel Signs Global Publishing Deal With Rondor and Universal|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/publishing/1083985/exclusive-billy-joel-signs-global-publishing-deal-with-rondor|accessdate=July 17, 2015|work=Billboard|date=August 30, 2012}}</ref>  On December 12, 2012, Joel performed as part of [[12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], a concert held for all the victims of [[Hurricane Sandy]]. He changed the lyrics to "[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]" to make it relate to all the damage caused by Sandy.  === 2013–present === In May 2013, it was announced that Joel would hold his first ever indoor Irish concert at the O2 in Dublin on November 1.  He subsequently announced his return to the UK for the first time in seven years to perform three dates in October and November.  Joel played two arena dates in Manchester and Birmingham plus a very special show at London's Hammersmith Apollo. In October, Joel held a surprise concert on Long Island at The Paramount (Huntington, NY) to benefit Long Island Cares. The venue holds a capacity of 1,555 and sold out in five minutes. Joel headlined a solo arena concert in New York City for the first time since 2006 when he performed at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31, 2013. In 2015, Joel performed 21 concerts (in addition to his Madison Square Garden residency) from January 7 to August 2 in various cities around the U.S. and Canada.  On December 3, 2013, it was announced that Joel would become a franchise of [[Madison Square Garden]], playing one concert a month indefinitely, starting with a date on January 27, 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/12/03/billy-joel-will-be-first-music-franchise-at-madison-square-garden/3769651/ |work=USA Today |title=Meet Madison Square Garden's new franchise: Billy Joel |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |date=December 3, 2013}}</ref>  On January 7, 2014, the [[Billy Joel in Concert]] tour began, which continues into March 2016.
