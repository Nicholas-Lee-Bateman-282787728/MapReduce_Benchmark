     Grease is a 1971 musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey with additional songs written by John Farrar. Named for the 1950s United States working-class youth subculture known as greasers, the musical is set in 1959 at fictional Rydell High School (based on Chicago, Illinois' William Howard Taft School) and follows ten working-class teenagers as they navigate the complexities of peer pressure, politics, personal core values, and love. The score attempts to recreate the sounds of early rock and roll. In its original production in Chicago, Grease was a raunchy, raw, aggressive, vulgar show. Subsequent productions sanitized it and tamed it down.  The show mentions social issues such as teenage pregnancy, peer pressure and gang violence; its themes include love, friendship, teenage rebellion, sexual exploration during adolescence, and, to some extent, class consciousness/class conflict. Grease was first performed in 1971 in the original Kingston Mines Chicago club (which was co-founded by Harry Hoch and June Pyskacek, and included the Kingston Mines Cafe), located in an old trolley barn (now the site of a hospital parking garage). From there, it has been successful on both stage and screen, but the content has been diluted and its teenage characters have become less Chicago habitués and more generic. At the time that it closed in 1980, Grease's 3,388-performance run was the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest yet in Broadway history]], although it was surpassed by ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' a few years later. It went on to become a [[West End theatre|West End]] hit, a [[Grease (film)|hugely successful film]], two popular [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revivals in 1994 and 2007, and a staple of [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatre]], [[summer stock]], [[community theatre]], and high school and middle school drama groups.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]'' reported in its May 26, 2008 issue, p. 51, that this musical ranked as the sixth most frequently produced musical by United States high schools in 2007.</ref> It remains Broadway's [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|15th longest-running show]].<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/75222.html "Long Runs on Broadway"] Playbill.com, August 14, 2011</ref> Aspects of the stage play would be incorporated into the production's [[Grease: Live|2016 live TV musical]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/thomas-kail-jumps-hamilton-grease-857961 |title='Hamilton's' Thomas Kail Makes the Leap to TV for "Bold" Take on 'Grease: Live' |last1=Rooney |first1=David |date=25 January 2016 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |publisher=Lynne Segall |access-date=3 February 2016 |quote=&nbsp;What we're doing here is taking the spine of the film and then also having access to parts of the stage play.&nbsp;}}</ref>  ==Production history==  ===Original productions and Broadway=== The show's original, grittier 1971 incarnation was directed by Guy Barille at the Kingston Mines Theater on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago. The script was based on [[Jim Jacobs]]' experience at William Taft High School, Chicago. Warren Casey collaborated with Jim and together they wrote the music and lyrics. It ran for eight months.<ref>http://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-85724145/</ref>   Producers [[Ken Waissman]] and Maxine Fox saw the show and made a deal to produce it [[Off-Broadway]]. The team headed to New York City to collaborate on the New York production of ''Grease''.  The new production, directed by [[Tom Moore (director)|Tom Moore]] and choreographed by [[Patricia Birch]] (who later choreographed the film adaptation, and directed the [[Grease 2|ill-fated sequel]]), opened Off-Broadway at the Eden Theatre in downtown [[Manhattan]] on February 14, 1972.

On June 7, 1972, the production moved to the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and on November 21, it moved to the [[Royale Theatre]] there, where it ran until January 27, 1980.

The original score includes four songs written for the film adaptation: "Hopelessly Devoted to You", "Sandy", "You're the One That I Want", and the title number.

She welcomes former cheerleader/yearbook-editor Patty Simcox Honeywell and class valedictorian Eugene Florczyk. Eugene gives a rousing speech, mentioning that the alumni who are missing from the reunion are surely present in-spirit. Suddenly, the [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]] gang known as the Burger Palace Boys (known in later versions of the production as the "T-Birds") and their auxiliary, the "Pink Ladies", appear and recite their own parody of the Rydell anthem: "Alma Mater" (Parody).  In the 2007 Broadway revival, the play begins differently, taking cues from the film adaptation. Here, we are introduced to Sandy Dumbrowski and Danny Zuko spending their last day of summer romance together. Sandy asks her lover Danny, "Is it all over?", and Danny reassures her that their love has only started. Then, as this scene fades away, the other greasers take the stage and sing about their rebellious lifestyle ("[[Grease (song)|Grease]]").  The play fades away into Rydell High's first day of the new school year. The Pink Ladies sit in the lunchroom, and the Burger Palace Boys sit at the entrance to the school. There is a new girl at school, Sandy Dumbrowski. She describes to the Pink Ladies (Frenchy, Marty, Jan, and Betty Rizzo) how she and the leader of the Burger Palace Boys, Danny Zuko, had a brief love affair the summer before, which ended with unresolved love. In describing the fling, Sandy focuses on the romance, while Danny exaggerates to the other Burger Palace Boys (Doody, Sonny, Roger, and Kenickie) regarding the physical aspects of their relationship ("[[Summer Nights (Grease song)|Summer Nights]]").  Sandy and Danny soon bump into each other at school, and while they are mutually happy to see each other, he brushes her off due to the expectations of his companions. As the Burger Palace Boys leave, Sandy is heartbroken, but the Pink Ladies calm her down and invite her over to Marty's pajama party. Shortly afterwards, the teenagers gather in the hall as Doody, the youngest Burger Palace Boy, shows off his new guitar. The rock star wannabe gives an impromptu concert in the hall ("[[Those Magic Changes]]").  At Marty's pajama party, the girls experiment with wine, cigarettes, and pierced ears; and talk about boys. Marty tells about her long-distance courtship with a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] named Freddy ("Freddy, My Love"). That same night, the Burger Palace Boys are busy stealing hubcaps and teasing Kenickie about his "new" used car, Greased Lightning, which he proudly brags about ("Greased Lightnin'").  Danny sees Sandy again at her cheerleader practice, and tries to apologize for his behavior. Head [[cheerleader]] Patty Simcox interrupts and flirts with Danny. Patty informs Danny that track try-outs are nearing, and Danny tells Sandy that he will join the track team to prove that he is sophisticated. After Danny leaves, Patty and Sandy practice their cheer choreo ("Rydell Fight Song").  The Burger Palace Boys and Pink Ladies take their newfangled portable radios for a picnic in the park. Roger shares his love for Jan and his hobby of exposing his rear end to unsuspecting victims ("Mooning"). Rizzo teases Danny for falling for a girl who resembles the excessively proper teenage ''ingénue'', [[Sandra Dee]], and the other greasers join in as she makes fun of Sandy, who has not arrived to the picnic yet ("Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee").  Sandy comes in just as the greasers finish making fun of her, and tells Danny that she wishes she never met him. Sandy leaves the picnic, Danny shrugs off Sandy's negative response, and the greasers pair off for the upcoming school prom. Danny teases Marty for not having a date, and the greasers all laugh, declaring that they will be friends no matter what ("We Go Together").  ===Act II=== It is the night of school prom where everyone is having fun dancing in the gym ("Shakin' At the High School Hop"). Sandy is at home by herself, listening to the radio and crying over how much she misses Danny ("It's Raining on Prom Night").  Meanwhile, Kenickie comes into the dance with his date, Cha-Cha DiGregorio, a homely looking girl from a different school known as Saint Bernadette's. Kenickie dumps his date Cha-Cha and pairs off with Rizzo, whom Danny entered the dance contest with, leaving Danny with Cha-Cha. The [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] Vince Fontaine, an enthusiastic radio [[disc jockey]], begins the [[hand jive]] dance contest, and everyone eagerly participates as he tags the contestants out ("Born to Hand Jive"). In the end, Danny and Cha-Cha are the winners. Amongst the awards given to the couple, Danny receives two free drive-in movie tickets.  In the 2007 Broadway revival, this scene continues: Sandy shows up at the dance shortly after the awards are handed out. The attendees are leaving, and Danny does not notice Sandy when he exits the room. Sandy cannot stop thinking about Danny despite how he has treated her ("[[Hopelessly Devoted to You]]").  Sometime later outside of the Burger Palace hangout, Kenickie, Doody, and Sonny run into Frenchy. The boys are armed with household "arsenal", and reveal that, to their surprise, Cha-Cha was the girlfriend of someone in the Burger Palace Boys' rival gang, the Flaming Dukes. Cha-Cha told the Flaming Dukes about how she danced with Danny, and, as a response, the Flaming Dukes challenged the Burger Palace Boys to a [[street fighting|rumble]]. Danny sprints into the scene, wearing a track suit after having joined the Rydell track team, to the disapproval and confusion of the other Burger Palace boys. Danny turns down their urgent invitation to the Flaming Dukes rumble due to time conflicts with a track race, which he sprints off to.  The three remaining Burger Palace Boys go into the Burger Palace for a snack before the fight, and Frenchy laments at what to do with her life, having dropped out of [[Cosmetology|beauty school]] for failing all of her classes. The heavenly Teen Angel appears with a chorus of back-up singing angels and tells her to return to high school, but she rejects the advice ("Beauty School Dropout").  Shortly afterwards, the three Burger Palace Boys exit the Burger Palace. They wait for the Flaming Dukes, but the rival gang never turns up. The greasers realize that Roger is missing. Just as they decide to leave, Roger finally turns up with a car antenna as his weapon, and the greasers criticize him for showing up so late with such a pathetic excuse for a weapon. Roger challenges the three Burger Palace Boys, who proceed to run off with Roger's pants and shoes.  In the next scene, Danny and Sandy are in Greased Lightning, watching a drive-in movie. Danny tells Sandy how upset his buddies are at him, and how sorry he is for his companion's behavior during the picnic. After Danny offers Sandy his ring, he attempts to get intimate with her, but moves too fast, and she leaves. Danny misses Sandy, and wishes that they could be together again ("Alone at a Drive-In Movie" or "Sandy", in the 2007 Broadway revival).  Several days later, Sandy and the greasers — without Danny — are having a party in Jan's basement as Doody, on guitar, performs alongside Roger ("Rock 'N' Roll Party Queen"). Rizzo is worried that she is pregnant, but tells Kenickie that he is not the father, and rejects offers of comfort from the other greasers, who leave the party. Rizzo is left alone with Sandy, who questions Rizzo on why she rejected her friends. Rizzo responds by saying that she is a better person than others make her out to be ("There Are Worse Things I Could Do"). Rizzo leaves, and Sandy decides what she needs to do to fit in with the greasers ("Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee" (Reprise).  The next day, the Burger Palace Boys are hanging out at the Burger Palace. Patty Simcox comes in, miserable and emotionally hurt. She tells them that Danny quit the track team and gave [[finger (gesture)|the finger]] to the coach. The Burger Palace Boys laugh and congratulate Danny, who returns. Sandy comes in alongside the Pink Ladies, having transformed herself into a greaser's dream date. Danny is delighted at this change and the couple express their mutual feelings for each other ("All Choked Up" or "[[You're the One That I Want]]", in the 2007 Broadway revival).  Afterwards, the other Burger Palace Boys and Pink Ladies cheer for Danny and Sandy being together again. They happily invite Patty to watch The Mickey Mouse Club with them at Roger's house, and she agrees. Rizzo reveals that she is not pregnant, and she and Kenickie reunite. All ends happily, and the Burger Palace Boys, the Pink Ladies, Sandy, and Patty sing about how they will always be friends to the end ("We Go Together" (Reprise)).  ===Revival changes=== Due to the popularity of the [[Grease (film)|1978 film adaptation]], which made several changes to the musical's songs and themes (many to accommodate its casting choice for Sandy, Australian singer [[Olivia Newton-John]]), the subsequent revivals adopted several of the changes made in the film, particularly the replacement of several songs, and the renaming of the Burger Palace Boys to their film name, the T-Birds. However, in the revival, the role of Sandy Dumbrowski is not changed from the original Broadway production.  ===School Version=== In order to make the original musical suitable for young performers and audiences, Jim Jacobs decided to write a "School Version" of the musical. This edition eliminates all of the references and uses of cigarettes and alcohol, as well as any swearing or bad language. Practically all of the songs have undergone changes as well; the numbers are all shortened tremendously and edited for content/language. Some plot lines are missing from the school version, such as Rizzo's pregnancy and her song "There Are Worse Things I Could Do". This section is entirely cut from the script and score. The beginning of the pajama party in Marty's bedroom is cut as well. (In this version, the Pink Ladies do not offer Sandy cigarettes or wine. Instead it begins directly with piercing her ears.) Overall, this version is considered to be [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|G-rated]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  The following songs of the School Version have undergone lyric changes:{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} * "Alma Mater Parody" * "Summer Nights" * "Freddy, My Love" * "Greased Lightnin'" * "Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee" * "Beauty School Dropout"  The remainder of the songs have been edited severely for time, deleting several verses from the original songs.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  ==Cast and characters== {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !
