    North American Soccer League (NASL) was the top-level major professional soccer league in the United States and Canada that operated from 1968 to 1984. It was the first soccer league to be successful on a national scale in the United States.  The league final was called the Soccer Bowl from 1975 to 1983 and the Soccer Bowl Series in its final year, 1984. The league was headed by Commissioner Phil Woosnam from 1969 to 1983. The league's popularity peaked in the late 1970s. The league averaged over 13,000 fans per game in each season from 1977 to 1983, and the league's matches were broadcast on network television from 1975 to 1980.NASL TV: A Short History, http://www.kenn.com/the_blog/?page_id=553   The league's most prominent team was the New York Cosmos. During the mid-to-late 1970s, the Cosmos signed a number of the world's best players —Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer, Carlos Alberto— and the Cosmos averaged over 28,000 fans for each season from 1977 to 1982 while having three seasons of the average attendance topping 40,000 spectators per game.  Other internationally well-known players in the league included Giorgio Chinaglia, Johann Cruyff, Johan Neeskens, Gerd Muller, George Best, and Rodney Marsh. The league additionally played indoor soccer from 1975–1976 and 1979–1984. In 1967, two professional soccer leagues started in the United States: the FIFA-sanctioned United Soccer Association, which consisted of entire European and South American teams brought to the U.S. and given local names, and the unsanctioned National Professional Soccer League. It has been suggested that the timing of the creation of these professional leagues was related to the amount of attention given throughout the English-speaking world to the victory by England in the 1966 FIFA World Cup and the resulting documentary film, Goal. The National Professional Soccer League had a national television contract in the U.S. with the CBS television network, and referees were instructed to whistle fouls and delay play to allow CBS to insert commercials.NASL TV: A Short Story, http://www.kenn.com/the_blog/?page_id=553 The ratings for matches were unacceptable even by weekend daytime standards and the arrangement with CBS was terminated. Bill MacPhail, head of CBS Sports, attributed NPSL's lack of TV appeal to empty stadiums with few fans, and to undistinguished foreign players who were unfamiliar to American soccer fans.Sports Illustrated, Soccer Is Getting A Toehold, August 30, 1976, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1091476/index.htm The two leagues merged on December 7, 1967 to form the North American Soccer League (NASL). NASL began the 1968 season with 17 of the 22 teams that had participated during the 1967 season. The teams relied mostly on foreign talent, including the Brazilian Vavá, one of the leading scorers of the 1958 and 1962 World Cups. International friendlies included victories against Pele's Santos and against English champions Manchester City.The Year in American Soccer - 1968, Steve Holroyd, http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1968.html Despite some of the league's successes, the league also had significant problems. The 17 teams included only 30 North American players. The expenses of high salaries for foreign players and renting of large stadiums, coupled with low attendances, resulted in every team losing money in 1968.  Only five of the 17 teams returned for the 1969 season. The NASL thought it needed to sell to North Americans the sport of soccer, which was then completely foreign to the majority of them. The league modified the rules in an attempt to make the game more exciting, and comprehensible, to the average sports fan. These changes included a clock that counted time down to zero as was typical of other timed American sports, rather than upwards to 90 minutes as was traditional. NASL implemented in 1972 a  line for offside (a rule change designed to reduce prevalent offside traps) rather than the usual half-way line, but in 1982 FIFA put an end to that NASL rule change.The Question:  Why is the modern offside law a stroke of genius?, The GuardianSports Illustrated, The Nasl: It's Alive But On Death Row, May 7, 1984, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122044/2/index.htm NASL introduced a penalty shootout in 1974 to decide matches that ended in a draw. The league also carried over the points system used by the NPSL in the previous year in which teams were awarded 6 points for win and 3 for a draw, plus up to 3 bonus points for each goal scored. On five occasions this nontraditional system gave the regular season title to a team other than the one with the best record. In 1971, NASL added three teams—the New York Cosmos, Montreal Olympique, and the Toronto Metros—each of which paid a $25,000 expansion fee.FLYING THE AMERICAN FLAG: THE 1971 ST LOUIS STARS, Chris Nee, April 11, 2013, http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2013/4/8/flying-the-american-flag-the-1971-st-louis-stars The NASL of the early 1970s was, to a large extent, a semi-pro league, with many of the players holding other jobs. On September 3, 1973, Sports Illustrated featured a soccer player on its cover for the first time — Philadelphia Atoms goalkeeper Bob Rigby.This Day In Football History, September 3, 1974 - The SI Cover Jinx Strikes Again, September 3, 2010, http://tdifh.blogspot.com/2010/09/3-september-1974-si-cover-jinx-strikes.html. (There is a typo in the article - should say 1973 instead of 1974) SI profiled the Philadelphia Atoms victory in the NASL championship, the first time an American expansion sports team won a title in its first season. Philadelphia averaged 11,500 fans in 1973, the first time since 1967 that any North American professional soccer team had averaged over 10,000 fans.North American Soccer League Players, Stats, Standings, http://www.nasljerseys.com/Stats/Standings.htm The cover title declared "Soccer Goes American," as Philadelphia had started six Americans in the championship match. Despite the "Soccer Goes American" title, however, in no season after 1974 did any American player win the MVP award or finish as league top scorer, as the mid-1970s saw an influx of foreign talent. SI predicted continued success for the Philadelphia Atoms, but the Atoms dissolved in 1976. NASL's average attendance had grown steadily from a low of 2,930 in 1969 to 7,770 in 1974, and by 1974 four teams were averaging over 10,000 attendance. The 1974 NASL Championship game between the Los Angeles Aztecs and the Miami Toros was televised live on CBS, the first national broadcast of a pro soccer match in the United States since 1968.Fun While It Lasted, August 25, 1974 – NASL Championship Game – Miami Toros vs. Los Angeles Aztecs, http://www.funwhileitlasted.net/tag/los-angeles-aztecs/ The 1974 and 1975 seasons saw rapid expansion for NASL.  In 1974, eight new teams paid the $75,000 franchise fee and joined the league, although two existing teams folded.The Year in American Soccer - 1974, Steve Holroyd, http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1974.html The 1974 expansion saw teams on the west coast, giving NASL a national presence for the first time. The west coast expansion was a success, with three of the teams — San Jose, Seattle and Vancouver — averaging over 10,000 fans in 1974. In 1975, five more franchises were added. Two of these five additions — Chicago and Hartford — were in cities that had successful franchises in the Division II American Soccer League, which at the time saw itself as a potential challenger to NASL as the U.S.'s top professional soccer league.Steve Holroyd, The Year in American Soccer - 1975, http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1975.html The expansions of 1974 and 1975 meant that NASL had grown from 9 teams in 1973 to 20 teams by 1975. The 1975 season saw the signing of internationally known players, including Portuguese star Eusébio (who Rhode Island of the Division II ASL had tried to sign), and former England goalkeeper Peter Bonetti. Pelé's arrival created a media sensation and overnight transformed the fortunes of soccer in the United States. From the moment he signed his contract at the 21 Club on June 10, 1975 in front of a crush of ecstatic worldwide media, Pele's every move was followed, bringing attention and credibility to soccer in America. The New York Cosmos' home attendance tripled in just half the season Pele was there, and on the road the Cosmos also played in front of huge crowds that came to watch Pelé play. Pele's arrival resulted in greater TV exposure for the Cosmos and for the league overall. Ten million people tuned in to watch CBS' live broadcast of Pele's debut match—a record American TV audience for soccer—with the Cosmos on June 15, 1975 against the Dallas Tornado at Downing Stadium in New York. CBS also televised another Cosmos match plus the 1975 Soccer Bowl championship match, and in 1976 ABC signed a contract to broadcast matches during the 1976 season. By 1976, NASL was being picked up by the mainstream media, with the sports pages of newspapers covering NASL. The NASL was shown on the TVS network during 1977 and 1978, although some games were tape delayed or not carried in certain markets. The biggest club in the league and the organization's bellwether was the Cosmos, who drew upwards of 40,000 fans per game at their height while, along with Pelé (Brazil), another aging superstar Franz Beckenbauer (Germany) played for them. Although both well past their prime by the time they joined the NASL, the two were considered to have previously been the best attacking (offensive) (Pelé) and defensive (Beckenbauer) players in the world. Giants Stadium sold out (73,000+) their 1978 championship win. However, the overall average attendance of the entire league never reached 15,000, with some clubs averaging less than 5,000. The Los Angeles Aztecs signed Manchester United star George Best in 1976.  NASL had been trying to persuade Best to come to America and place him in a major media market, but once the New York Cosmos had signed Pele, Los Angeles was the logical placement for Best.US Soccer Players, George Best In America, http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/george-best-in-america Best was traded to Fort Lauderdale in 1978, and in 1979 Los Angeles signed its next big star, Johann Cruyff. Cruyff was an instant success, doubling the team's attendance, and winning the league's MVP award.Sports Illustrated, A Modified American Plan, March 31, 1980, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123309/index.htm LA also brought in a new head coach from 1979-1980, Rinus Michels, who had coached Ajax Amsterdam, Barcelona, and the Dutch national team, the man credited with the invention of the Dutch playing style of "Total Football" in the 1970s. The Minnesota Kicks were established in 1976 and quickly became one of the league's more popular teams, drawing an average attendance of 23,120 fans per game in 1976 to the Metropolitan Stadium in the suburbs of Minneapolis.Sports Illustrated, Minnesota Had To Eat Croatmeal, September 6, 1976, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1091495/index.htm The Kicks won their division four years in a row from 1976–79, drawing over 23,000 fans in each of those four seasons (peaking at 32,775 in 1977). After LA, Cruyff then moved on to the Washington Diplomats.Football Republik, DEAL OF THE CENTURY – When Leicester City almost signed Johan Cruyff, June 26, 2013, http://footballrepublik.com/johan-cruyff-and-leicester-city/ The Washington Diplomats had been purchased by Madison Square Garden Corp. and its Chairman Sonny Werblin in October 1978. Cruyff's presence was a huge boost, as was Wim Jansen, a midfielder who had played for the Netherlands at the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. For the 1980 season, the Diplomats attendance was 19,205 spectators per match.Fun While It Lasted, June 1, 1980 – Washington Diplomats vs. New York Cosmos, http://www.funwhileitlasted.net/2013/07/03/june-1-1980-washington-diplomats-vs-new-york-cosmos/ Despite NASL's apparent success, of NASL's 18 teams in 1977, six were considered franchises that needed to be relocated, bought out, or folded.Clive Toye, A Kick in the Grass (2006) A planning committee of owners issued a report recommending that NASL strengthen its existing teams, and limit expansion to two franchises for 1978, with one additional franchise per year for the following years.New York Times, N.A.S.L. IS LIKELY TO OUST WOOSNAM, April 25, 1982, http://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/sports/nasl-is-likely-to-oust-woosnam.html Despite this recommendation, NASL brought in six new teams at $3 million per team, raising the league's teams from 18 to 24 for the 1978 season. San Diego Sockers President Jack Daley later described NASL's boom years of the late 1970s: "It became fashionable to chase the Cosmos. Everyone had to have a Pelé. Coaches went around the world on talent searches, forcing the prices up."Sports Illustrated, The Nasl: It's Alive But On Death Row, May 7, 1984, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122044/index.htm The Portland Timbers tripled their team payroll from 1979 to 1980 in an effort to keep up with the league average.Sports Illustrated, A Modified American Plan, March 31, 1980, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123309/2/index.htm The league began a college draft in 1972 in an attempt to increase the number of U.S.- and Canadian-born players in the league. The foreign image of soccer was not helped, however, by a league that brought in many older, high profile foreign players, and frequently left Americans on the bench. This effort was often doubly futile, as while many of the foreign players were perhaps "big names" in their home countries, almost none of them qualified as such in North America, and they quickly absorbed most of the available payroll, such as it was, which could have otherwise been used to pay North American players better. As of 1979, NASL rules required that each squad start two U.S. or Canadian players—often a goalkeeper and an outside defender—and that each 17-man roster carry six native players.Sports Illustrated, Tea Party Brewing In The Nasl, August 6, 1979, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1095218/index.htm The U.S. had lacked sufficient quality youth soccer programs in the 1950s, resulting in the dearth of U.S.-born talent in NASL in the 1970s. NASL suffered a minor blow with a players strike at the start of the 1979 season, but the strike was honored by only one third of the players and lasted only five days.Big Soccer, What killed the NASL?, August 13, 2012, http://www.bigsoccer.com/soccer/roger-allaway/2012/08/13/what-killed-the-nasl/ In 1980, the minimum number of U.S. and Canadian starters was raised to three. The 1980 season was referred to as "the year of the North American player" with a renewed emphasis on "native players." With the increased requirements for teams to field U.S. and Canadian players, demand for quality native players boomed, with Jim McAlister setting a transfer record for an American player at $200,000. With the end of the 1970s, NASL seemed poised for moderate success.  The 1979 season had seen attendance increase by 8%. ABC televised several matches during the 1979 and 1980 seasons.kenn.com, NASL TV: A Short History, http://www.kenn.com/the_blog/?page_id=553 An apparent era of stability seemed to have arrived, with the 1980 season expecting no planned expansion, relocations or failed teams among its 24 franchises, and with most rosters remaining relatively stable. At the close of the 1980 season, NASL's woes were beginning to mount, as NASL was feeling the effects of over-expansion, the economic recession, and disputes with the players union.Sports Illustrated, It's Time For Trimming Sails In The Nasl, December 1, 1980, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123998/2/index.htm In the early 1980s the U.S. economy went in the doldrums, with unemployment reaching 10.8% in 1982, its highest level since World War II. NASL's owners, who were losing money, were not immune from the broader economy. Perhaps most troubling of all, NASL owners were spending sums on player salaries that could not be covered by league revenue.  Whereas NFL owners in 1980 were spending on average 40% of the team's budget on player salaries, NASL owners were averaging over 70% of their budget on player salaries. The Cosmos in particular, owned by Warner Communications, were spending lavish sums on player salaries, and while other teams—such as Los Angeles, Jacksonville, Portland, Toronto, and Montreal—that were owned by major corporations could keep up with the Cosmos, owners without deep pockets could not keep pace with the spending levels. Owners spent millions on aging stars to try to match the success of the Cosmos, and lost significant amounts of money in doing so. Another headache for NASL was competition from the resurgent Major Indoor Soccer League.This Year in American Soccer - 1981, http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1981.html The MISL began during the 1978-79 season, grew quickly, and by the early 1980s MISL was averaging over 8,000 fans per season. MISL's growth meant that throughout the early 1980s the NASL and the MISL engaged in a bidding war for U.S. based soccer players, putting further pressure on league salaries and heightening NASL's financial problems. In an effort to vie for MISL's expanding audiences, the NASL operated an indoor soccer league from 1979–80 to 1981–82 and in 1983–84. As a result, the league ran a collective deficit in 1980 of about $30 million, with each team losing money. The San Diego Sockers lost $10 million from 1978 to 1983, and Tulsa lost $8 million from 1980 to 1983. The Washington Diplomats folded in November 1980, after owners MSG Corp. lost a rumored $5 million on the team in 1979 and 1980. NASL had also decided to sell TV advertising locally, instead of recruiting national sponsors.Los Angeles Times, WORLD CUP USA '94 : A Model Failure : The NASL's Collapse Serves as a Painful Reminder of What a New League Should Not Do, July 3, 1994, http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-03/news/ss-11408_1_world-cup During the 1980 offseason, the NASL Players' Association was in dispute with the league over projected payments for the indoor season, causing the players to file a lawsuit against the league. The 1981 season was even worse for the league, with the league's 24 teams again running a collective deficit of $30 million and every team losing money.The Telegraph, Soccer: Is it still the sport of the '80s?, November 12, 1981, https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat=19811112&id=qaErAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hfwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6924,2551485 Ted Turner's Atlanta Chiefs lost $7 million, the Minnesota Kicks lost $2.5 million, the Calgary Boomers lost over $2 million, and Lamar Hunt's Dallas Tornado had lost $1 million annually.  At the close of the 1981 season five teams folded, with another two teams—the L.A. Aztecs and Minnesota Kicks—later folding during the 1981-82 offseason after failing to find buyers. NASL shrank from 21 teams to 14. Many of these new owners were not soccer savvy, and once the perceived popularity started to decline, they got out as quickly as they got in.   Over-expansion without sufficient vetting of ownership groups was a huge factor in the death of the league. Once the league started growing, new franchises were awarded quickly, and it doubled in size in a few years, peaking at 24 teams. Many have suggested that cash-starved existing owners longed for their share of the expansion fee charged of new owners, even though Forbes Magazine reported this amount as being only $100,000. With the NASL declining rapidly in the early 1980s and losing many franchises, NASL made several changes in an attempt to keep the league going. Phil Woosnam, who had served as NASL Commissioner since 1969 and had been a strong proponent of expansion during the 1970s, was removed by the league's 14 owners in April 1982 by a reported 11-3 vote. NASL tried to help bring the 1986 World Cup to the United States after Colombia withdrew from its commitment to host, but FIFA decided in 1983 to award the hosting of the 1986 FIFA World Cup to Mexico, rather than the U.S. In early 1984, NASL reached a collective bargaining agreement with the NASL Players Association that included a $825,000 salary cap to be achieved by annual 10% reductions, and a reduction in roster sizes from 28 to 19. The league lasted until the 1984 NASL season. On March 28, 1985, the NASL suspended operations for the 1985 season, when only the Minnesota Strikers and Toronto Blizzard were interested in playing. At the time, the league planned to relaunch in 1986."NASL suspends operations for 1985" page 1D Minneapolis Star and Tribune March 29, 1985 However, four NASL teams (Chicago Sting, Minnesota Strikers, New York Cosmos, and San Diego Sockers) joined the Major Indoor Soccer League for its 1984–85 season. The Golden Bay Earthquakes and Tampa Bay Rowdies managed to survive as independent franchises until they joined the WSA and AISL respectively. The Rowdies were the last surviving NASL franchise to play outdoor soccer, lasting until February 1994.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19940202&id=4wEcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qXsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4377,1974145 The Sockers' were the final league franchise to dissolve. They survived playing exclusively indoor soccer until 1996. Although the NASL ultimately failed, it introduced soccer to the North American sports scene on a large scale for the first time, and was a major contributing factor in soccer becoming one of the most popular sports among American youth. On July 4, 1988, FIFA awarded the hosting of the 1994 World Cup to the United States. NASL has also provided lessons for its successor Major League Soccer, which has taken precautions against such problems, particularly a philosophy of financial restraint (mainstream American sports, by the time of MLS' startup in 1996, had adopted financial restraint rules, which MLS adopted). American college and high school soccer still use some NASL-style rules (with shortened halves, although the time does stop for certain reasons). Several of the NASL team names have been later reused for teams in later soccer leagues. The Portland Timbers, San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders, and Vancouver Whitecaps names have all been used for successor teams in Major League Soccer, with other team names (New York Cosmos, Tampa Bay Rowdies, Fort Lauderdale Strikers) used in the Division II NASL that began play in 2011. The NASL began playing indoor soccer as well as "outdoor" soccer in 1975 and 1976 in a tournament format. For many years Tampa Bay owner George W. Strawbridge, Jr. continually lobbied his fellow owners to start up a winter indoor season, but was always stone-walled.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fFlQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jlgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4763,3078494&dq=indoor+awry&hl=enhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hk5SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NXwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6646,3097645&dq=george+strawbridge+cosmos&hl=en For the following few years, his Rowdies and several other teams used winter indoor "friendlies" as part of their training and build-up to the outdoor season. In the meantime, pressed by the rival Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL), which inaugurated play in 1978, the four-team NASL Budweiser Invitational was played over two days in January 1979 before a full arena.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rsEwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3VgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6654,3317860&dq=rowdies+had+to+do+more&hl=en The NASL finally started a full indoor league schedule, a 12-game season with 10 teams, in 1979–80. For the 1980–81 season, the number of teams playing indoor soccer increased to 19 and the schedule went to 18 games. The schedule remained at 18 games, but the teams participating decreased to 13 for the 1981–82 season. The league canceled the 1982–83 indoor season and three teams (Chicago, Golden Bay, and San Diego) played in the MISL for that season. Four other teams (Ft. Lauderdale, Montreal, Tampa Bay and Tulsa) competed in a short NASL Grand Prix of Indoor Soccer Tournament in early 1983. The NASL indoor season returned for 1983–84 with only seven teams but a 32-game schedule. * Due to the NASL's nontraditional points system, in 1968, 1969, 1980, 1983 & 1984 the team with the best win-loss record did not win the regular season. # The New York Cosmos dropped "New York" from its name for the 1977 and 1978 seasons, then returned to the full name. # The New York Cosmos dropped "New York" from its name for the 1977 and 1978 seasons, then returned to the full name.  - existed before 1968 NASL formation.  - continued after 1984 NASL demise.  - existed before 1968 and after 1984. *Operated as Toronto Croatia from 1956 until they merged with the NASL's Toronto Metros in 1975, and then again after they sold-out of the NASL in 1979. Of the 67 teams that played in the NASL over the course of its 17 seasons, many represent relocated franchises, and a handful represent the same franchise in the same location with changed names such as the Apollos, Cosmos and Earthquakes. The total number of unique clubs was 43. The current Heritage Cup in Major League Soccer was developed as a way to remember the NASL's heritage by having teams named after NASL teams to participate for a special trophy.  Today, two MLS teams, San Jose and Seattle, play for this trophy, although Portland and Vancouver are both eligible for the trophy if they decide to participate in this derby. During NASL's peak during the late 1970s and early 1980s, NASL brought some of the world's best soccer players to the United States.  The trend was started when the New York Cosmos signed Pele in 1975. At one time, NASL teams fielded the captains of the past three World Cup-winning teams—Beckenbauer (1974), Alberto (1970), and Moore (1966). Of the European Footballer of the Year awards from 1968 to 1976, seven of the nine awards—Best (1968), Muller (1970), Cruyuff (1971, '73, '74), Beckenbauer (1972, '76)—were given to players who went on to play in NASL. The following table shows the most well-known NASL players who had collected international accolades before joining NASL. *Cosmos dropped "New York" from name for 1977 and 1978 seasons The New York Cosmos hold 21 of the 24 top attendance records in NASL history.

He served the NASL through its first full season, 1968, then returned to baseball. 1967: Ken Macker (NPSL) 1968: Walsh and Macker co-commissioners 1969–83: Phil Woosnam - He is credited as an important factor in the development of the NASL, and had been a major figure in promoting the league and had secured TV contracts from CBS and ABC. He played a key role during 1970 in recruiting executives at Warner Communications to invest in an expansion team—the New York Cosmos."Nothing But Blue Skies Does Woosnam", Sports Illustrated, May 30, 1977. Woosnam oversaw the westward expansion of NASL in the early 1970s, establishing teams in Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Seattle, and Vancouver. However, he also guided the league into several poor business decisions, such as over-expansion to 24 teams, and the league's owners had been losing significant money and was removed from his duties as commissioner of the NASL in 1983 following a vote of the club owners. 1983–84: Howard J. Samuels - His pioneering methods in the petrochemical industry and success in the then niche household consumer market translated into posts as Vice President of the Mobil Oil Corporation, Commissioner of the North American Soccer League, and Chairman to Elms Capital Management, Alexander Proudfoot PLC, and Communities In Schools. 1984–85: Clive Toye (acting) - After the sudden death of Howard J. Samuels, Toye was appointed interim president of the NASL in December 1984.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BqJlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nowNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1334,1716110&dq=clive+toye&hl=en The league ceased operations the following Spring.
