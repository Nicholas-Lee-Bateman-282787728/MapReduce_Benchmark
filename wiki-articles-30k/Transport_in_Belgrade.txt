   This article deals with the system of transport in Belgrade, both public and private. Belgrade has an extensive public transport system, which consists of buses, trams, trolley buses and trains operated by the city-owned GSP BelgradeГСП "Београд" – City-owned transport company and several private companies. All companies participate in Integrated Tariff System (ITS), which makes tickets transferable between companies and vehicle types. Tickets can be purchased in numerous kiosks or from the driver. They must be canceled inside the vehicle and are valid for one ride only. As of 1. February 2012. started to work BusPlus modern electronic system for managing vehicles and transportation tickets in public transport,http://www.busplus.rs/ a system based on a vague contract which does not explicitly state the profit made by Apex Technology Solutions, and the giveaway of advertising space on bus stations.http://pistaljka.rs/home/read/190   The main Belgrade Bus Station is located at Železnička 4.Београдска Аутобуска Станица БАС – Belgrade Bus Station City public bus transportation is operated by 7 main carriers: There are 149 regular lines, 27 night lines and 2 night lines that have letter L behind a number: 304L and 601L. Night lines are 7, 15, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 37, 47, 48, 51, 56, 68, 75, 96, 101, 202, 301, 304, 308, 401, 511, 601, 603, 704, 706.

Night lines that are introduced are: thirty three, thirty seven, forty eight, ninety six, seven hundred and four, seven hundred and six. Night line 304 goes as trolleybus line 28 (Makedonska - Svetogorska - Takovska - Jaše Prodanovića - Cvijićeva - Dimitrija Tucovića) and her next route is: Batutova - Bulevar kralja Aleksandra - Smederevski put - Profesora Vasića - Palih boraca - Miloša Obrenovića - Vinča - Miloša Obrenovića - Palih boraca - Profesora Vasića - Smederevski put - Kružni put - Ravan - Leštane - Ravan - Kružni put - Smederevski put - Put za Boleč - Maršala Tita - Jumbina - Boleč - Jumbina - Maršala Tita - Put za Boleč - Smederevski put - Put za Ritopek - Maršala Tita - Ritopek. Night line 401 goes as tramway line 10 (Cara Dušana - Džordža Vašingtona - 27. marta - Starine Novaka - Beogradska - Trg Slavija - Bulevar oslobođenja - Trg oslobođenja - Vojvode Stepe - Bebelova - Baštovanska) and her next route is: Paunova - Bulevar oslobođenja - Put za Avalu - Vase Čarapića - Beli potok - Vase Čarapića - Put za Avalu - Put za Pinosavu - Pinosava. Each of the regular lines is operated by GSP and by one of the other carriers, while night lines are conducted only by private carriers. Private carriers were introduced in 1990s after many strikes in GSP, which had the monopoly till then. There were many unsuccessful efforts by the city after 2000 to unify them into the same ticket system. Finally, in 2004 it was agreed that ITS (integrated tariff system) will be introduced. These 6 companies will carry the public transportation till 2012, when the City Government will decide whether GSP is going to remain the only transport company. City Bus Lines:http://www.gsp.rs/english/dailylines.htm    The first tram line was introduced in 1892. The current extent of the network track is unchanged since 1988, though with some re-routings of the tram lines. Trams and trolleys are operated exclusively by GSP Beograd, and there are 11 regular tram lines, 4 local tram lines (7L, 9L, 12L and 14L), 7 regular trolleybus lines and 2 local trolleybus lines (22L and 29L). Belgrade has 10 current trams, 2 discontinued trams and 3 discontinued temporarily established trams (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7L, 9, 9L, 10, 11, 12, 12L, 13, 14 and 14L). Interestingly, tram line 2 (dva) is a circular line around the downtown, so often downtown is referred to as krug dvojke (the circle of line 2). Tram Lines: Tram network and termini: All the revenue service track is constructed as parallel double track with terminal loops.  There are 8 revenue service loops in the system: Kneževac, Omladinski stadion, Kalemegdan, Ustanička, Tašmajdan, Block 45, Banjica, Banovo brdo.  There are further 9 auxiliary loops: Pristanište, Slavija, Autokomanda, Trošarina, Radio industrija, Gospodarska mehana, Topčider, Railway station, Rakovica. Only the first three are actively used for cutting short during the schedule disruptions. The loops Slavija and Autokomanda are located in roundabouts and are normally used for the revenue thru-traffic. Other auxiliary loops are used only as alternatives during the closures. The last two loops (Rakovica and Railway Station) are defunct. The track at Rakovica is disconnected from the main line. The loop at Railway station was recently reconstructed but is completely out of use due to unworkable design. Interestingly, the circular line 2 does not use loops at its terminus at Pristanište. It makes the service stops on the main line instead. Tram depots: There are 3 tram depots in Belgrade. Sava is the central active service depot built in New Belgrade in 1988. Dorćol ("Lower depot") is the historical electrical cars depot from 1894 which is used only for auxiliary and overhaul purposes. It is co-located with the active service trolleybus depot. The two single-track lines leading to it are the only exceptions to otherwise parallel double track network in the system and are not used in the revenue service. The third "Upper depot" is the historical horse-drawn cars depot from 1892. It retains its track but was recently disconnected from the main line. The depot is completely void of trams and is now housing only the overhead wiring maintenance unit. The plans to adapt it into the public transportation museum have never materialised. Trolley Lines: The first trolleybus line was introduced in 1947 to replace trams on the central corridor Kalemegdan-Slavija. The network extent is unchanged since late 1980s, though with minor relocation of the central terminus from Kalemegdan to Studentski trg in late 1990s. Belgrade has 7 current trolleybuses, 1 discontinued trolleybus and 1 discontinued temporarily established trolleybus (19, 21, 22, 22L, 28, 29, 29L, 40 and 41). Trolley network and termini: There are 4 revenue service terminal loops in the system: Studentski trg, Konjarnik, Banjica 2, Medaković 3. The peripheral termini Učiteljsko naselje, Kruševačka and Zvezdara have no purpose-built loops: the trolleybuses are circling around the city block instead. Additionally, there are 3 auxiliary loops in the system: Slavija, Crveni krst and Banjica 1. The auxiliary loops are actively used for cutting short during the schedule disruptions (the line number carries the suffix "L" on the departures to be cut short). Crveni krst and Banjica 1 can be used only in the direction towards the peripheral termini, Slavija can be used in both directions. In April 2007, six minibus lines were introduced (E1-E7, except E3) which criss-cross Belgrade. Minibuses are all air-conditioned, smaller and generally quicker than buses. However, tickets are bought inside a minibus and they are more expensive than ordinary ones – minibuses are out of integrated tariff system. Minibus City Lines:[ ][ ] Night Lines:  Belgrade is one of the last biggest European capitals and cities-millionaires, that has no metro/subway or other rapid transit system.  Construction of metro was expected two times but still delayed. The Belgrade Metro is considered to be the third most important project in the country, after work on roads and railways. The two projects of highest priority are the Belgrade bypass and Pan-European corridor X.  On September 1, 2010, as "almost" metro and its 1st phase, the first line of Belgrade's new urban BG:Voz system, separate from suburban commuter Beovoz system, started its operation.http://www.serbianrailways.com/system/sr-latin/home/newsplus/viewsingle/_params/newsplus_news_id/25720.htmlSerbian: http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=1407866 First line, for the time being, connected Pančevački most station with Novi Beograd station and used the semi-underground level of Beograd Centar rail station, two underground stations (Vukov Spomenik and Karađorđev park) and tunnels in the city's centre that were built for ground rail tracks to Novi Beograd. The line had just 5 stations (Pančevački most, Vukov spomenik, Karađorđev park, Beograd Centar and Novi Beograd, which shares with Beovoz), 8 kilometer length and about 16 minutes time of travel. Train frequency was from 30 minutes with 15 minutes frequency during rush hour. The line uses the similar to suburban Soviet/Latvian electric rolling stocks with upper current collectors including ER31 with 3 doors along the side of vagon. From April 2011. line has been extended to Batajnica. New line have about 18500 passengers every day. A new line from Prokop to Resnik is planned for 2012.MapPhotos of stations and trains Suburban bus transportation is conducted by SP Lasta. Beside Lasta, certain number of suburban lines are operated by other carriers, too.  Suburban transport on the territory of Belgrade is performed within the integrated tariff system 2 (ITS2), with over 300 lines and 2,500 daily departures. The network of suburban lines spreads radially from Belgrade to the centers of the suburban municipalities, from which Lasta's local lines can be used to reach smaller places. Suburban buses depart from the Lasta Bus Station in Belgrade and from the terminus of Šumice near Konjarnik in the neighbourhood of Zvezdara and another in Banovo Brdo. Lasta transports passengers in the local transport in the areas of the Mladenovac, Sopot, Lazarevac, Obrenovac, Grocka, and Barajevo municipalities. Bus Lines:https://www.busplus.rs/page-servisi-spisak-linija-autobusi-its2.php   Similar to German S-Bahn, France RER etc. suburban rail system Beovoz is operated by Serbian Railways, the national railway company.Железнице Србије – Serbian Railways Currently, Beovoz has six lines with 41 stations and 70&nbsp;km length: Two underground stations near the downtown (Vukov spomenik and Karađorđev park) used by lines 1,2 and shares by BG:Voz cityrail. Taxi service is operated by 24 taxi companies, and it's not very expensive (start is about 1.5 euros (150 Dinars). Every Belgrade taxi company has to have 2 signs: a company unique sign and a smaller blue sign with 4 white numbers – a unique number of each vehicle of Belgrade taxi. Belgrade is connected by intercity bus lines with all major towns in Serbia, while during summer and winter tourist seasons there are also special seasonal lines. There is a good connection with the cities in Republika Srpska and Macedonia. The international bus lines to Western Europe are mainly focused on Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France, where buses can be taken for all other destinations. SP Lasta, besides suburban transport, carries passengers in intercity transport on regular lines in Serbia and Montenegro and Republika Srpska and in international transport, as part of the Eurolines organization.  The Belgrade railroad network is currently under reconstruction . The massive reconstruction scheme of the Belgrade railway junction calls for completion of the new central Prokop railway station that is to replace the historical Belgrade Central Railway Station (Главна Железничка Станица, Glavna železnička stanica) situated near the downtown and Sava river. Belgrade is directly connected by train with many European cities (Salonica, Istanbul, Sofia, Bucharest, Budapest, Vienna, Kiev, Moscow). In addition, there are 5 more railway stations in Belgrade (Centar – Prokop, Dunav, Rakovica, Novi Beograd, Zemun). Some long distance and international trains do not call at Central Station, but at Novi Beograd. A new central railway station has been under construction since 1977 at the site named Prokop. The new railway station will be called "Beograd Center"; upon its completion all Belgrade rail traffic currently handled by the old railway station situated near the downtown district will be transferred to the new station freeing thousands of square meters of prime real estate along the Sava and substantially easing the rail travel into Belgrade. After years of delay, this ambitious project is set to be completed in the next few years pending the new international tender for its completion set to be announced by the government at the beginning of March 2006.  The train terminals will be situated underground while the vast passenger terminal will be above ground featuring commercial spaces, possibly a hotel and other amenities.  Most of the rough work on the station's train terminals has been completed thus far.  Belgrade has been restricted in its use of its vast waterfront precisely because of the large rail infrastructure that hug the river banks of the Old Town. Completion of this station is signaling a major boom in Belgrade's waterfront development. The international airport, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport,Аеродром Никола Тесла Београд – Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport is located 12&nbsp;km outside the city. It is connected with the city by the Belgrade – Zagreb highway. Bus line of public transport number 72 and A1 connect Airport with downtown. Airport provides connections with many cities in Europe, Asia and Africa. A major expansion of the airport in Belgrade has been detailed with a development deal signed with DynaCorp. Inc. to build a regional air cargo hub, but the plan has failed. Belgrade airport also plans to build a third passenger terminal and another runway; however this may not be feasible in the immediate future. Batajnica Air Base is a military airport located in the Batajnica suburb of Belgrade.    Belgrade has a commercial port on the banks of Danube named Luka Beograd.Лука Београд – Belgrade Port There is also a tourist port on the banks of the Sava welcoming various river cruise vessels from across Europe. Belgrade has several impromptu sporting marinas near the islands of Ada Ciganlija and Ada Međica harbouring small sail boats and sporting/recreational vessels. There are no regular passenger lines from the Belgrade Port (Luka Beograd), although tourist and individual lines run occasionally. Answering to the need for a real sporting/recreational marina a detailed plan for a marina in Dorćol on the banks of the Danube has been presented to the public, and an international tender for its development has been announced. There are ten bridges over Sava and one over Danube in and around Belgrade, listed generally from east to west:  Belgrade is connected by motorways to Zagreb to the west, Novi Sad to the north and Niš to the south. The motorways feed traffic into a large interchange popularly called Mostar. A wide boulevard, Ulica Kneza Miloša (Prince Miloš Street) connects the interchange to the city centre. A traffic decongestion project named unutrašnji magistralni prsten ("inner ring road") is set to begin with the goal of easing the congestion in the city centre and on the motorways.

The total length of the bridge is 912 m. Of this, 460 m passes above the river in five spans, the longest of which is 141 m. The bridge was originally designed to carry only two heating water pipelines, but was later redesigned and built as a road bridge with the two pipelines on side cantilevers.http://www.mostogradnja.rs/English/reference2.htm Finished in 2012. The single-track railway truss bridge over Sava at Ostružnica — just outside the urbanized area of Belgrade, serving the freight bypass line. The bridge was badly damaged during the 1999 NATO bombing. Fully reconstructed. The three-lane semi-highway girder bridge over Sava at Ostružnica on the Belgrade bypass motorway — constructed by Mostogradnja between 1990 and 1998. Total length of the bridge is 1,789.6 m, with a 588 m long continuous steel structure crossing the river in five spans. The largest span is 198 m. The bridge was bombed by Nato during Kosovo war in 1999 and fully reconstructed by 2004. The additional three-lane span is planned. Ada Bridge, a 969 m long and 200m tall pylon bridge with six-lane roadway and unlaid double-track mass transit right-of-way is opened in 2012. Novi železnički most ("new railroad bridge") over Sava — a double-track cable-stayed bridge built in 1979. Stari železnički most ("old railroad bridge") over Sava — a single-track truss-bridge originally built in 1886. Gazela Bridge — a single span six-lane motorway bridge over Sava, the main traffic artery into the city, built in 1970. Stari savski most ("old Sava bridge") — a 410 m long two-lane road and tram bridge. The main span is a tied arch bridge over 100 m in length. During World War II it was the only road bridge available in Belgrade, the current span being installed in 1942, and one of the few bridges in Europe which the retreating German forces failed to demolish. In October 1944, the bridge, already laden with explosives and prepared for demolition, was saved by a local resistance veteran Miladin Zarić who managed to cut the detonator wires.http://www.danas.rs/20060208/terazije1.html Brankov most ("Branko's bridge") — a 450 m long six-lane road girder bridge over Sava, connecting the center of Belgrade to the densely populated residential suburb of Novi Beograd. Originally built as Most kralja Aleksandra ("King Alexander Bridge") in 1934 it was a chain-bridge. The bridge was destroyed in 1941 and rebuilt after the end of World War II, in 1956 as a single-span bridge, at the time it was the longest bridge of that kind in the world. Pančevački most ("Pančevo bridge") — a 1,075 m long combined four-lane road and double-track railroad truss bridge over the Danube, originally built in 1935. It was destroyed during World War II, and rebuilt after the end of the war in 1946. It's the only bridge over Danube river in Belgrade. The overhaul and installation of the second rail track was complete in 2015. Zemun-Borča Bridge is new six-lane road bridge over Danube, currently under construction by China Road and Bridge Corporation and expected to be finished in late 2014.
