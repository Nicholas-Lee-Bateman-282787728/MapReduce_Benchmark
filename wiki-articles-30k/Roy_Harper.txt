     Roy Harper (born 12 June 1941) is an English folk rock singer, songwriter and guitarist who has been a professional musician since 1964. Harper has released 22 studio albums and 10 live albums across his 50-year career. Harper's earliest musical influences were American blues musician Lead Belly and folk singer Woody Guthrie1994 Roy Harper Interview. Dirtylinen.com (8 April 2011).

Harper was also exposed to classical music in his childhood and has pointed to the influence of Jean Sibelius's Karelia Suite. Lyrical influences include the 19th century Romantics, especially Shelley, and Keats's poem "Endymion". Harper has also cited the Beat poets as being highly influential, particularly Jack Kerouac.2011 Roy Harper Interview. Clashmusic.com (22 September 2011).

Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph described him as "one of Britain’s most complex and eloquent lyricists and genuinely original songwriters... much admired by his peers" Across the Atlantic his influence has been acknowledged by Seattle-based acoustic band Fleet Foxes, American musician and producer Jonathan Wilson and Californian harpist Joanna Newsom with whom he has also toured. In 2005, Harper was awarded the MOJO Hero Award, and in 2013 a Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. In 2011, to celebrate his 70th birthday, he performed a celebratory concert at London's Royal Festival Hall. His most recent album, Man and Myth, was released in 2013. Harper was born in 1941 in Rusholme, a suburb of Manchester. His mother, Muriel, died three weeks after he was born. From the age of 6, he lived in St Annes on Sea, a place he described as being "like a cemetery with bus stops". He was brought up by his father and stepmother, with whom he became disillusioned because of her Jehovah's Witness beliefs, although they reconciled in 1980, just before her death. His anti-religious views would later become a familiar theme within his music. Harper began writing poems when he was 12. At the age of 13 he began playing skiffle music with his younger brother David ("Davey" on the album Flat Baroque and Berserk), as well as becoming influenced by blues music. At 14 he formed his first group (De Boys) with his brothers David and Harry. Harper was educated at King Edward VII School, Lytham St Annes, then a Grammar school and left at the age of 15 (1956) to join the Royal Air Force in order to follow an ambition to be a pilot. Harper eventually rejected the rigid discipline, feigned madness in order to obtain a military discharge and received one electroconvulsive therapy treatment at Princess Mary's RAF Hospital, Wendover. After being discharged from there, he spent one day inside the former 'Lancaster Moor Mental Institute' before escaping. These experiences would later make their way into "Committed", a song on Sophisticated Beggar, Harper's debut album. Upon his eventual exit from a troubled youth, around 1961 he busked around North Africa, Europe and London for a few years. On his return to London, he gained a residency at London's famous Soho folk music club, Les Cousins in 1965, having been introduced to it by Peter Bellamy of the Young Tradition.http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2011/10/bert_jansch_a_tribute.html Roy Harper's tribute to Bert Jansch Within the first week Harper saw John Renbourn, Alexis Korner, Paul Simon, Alex Campbell and Bert Jansch play and he would play, associate, and 'rub shoulders' with other artists arriving later, including John Martyn, Joni Mitchell and Nick Drake. Harper's first album, Sophisticated Beggar, was recorded in 1966 after he was spotted at Les Cousins and signed to Peter Richards' Strike Records. The album consisted of Harper's songs and poetry backed by acoustic guitar and recorded with a Revox tape machine by Pierre Tubbs. (English guitarist Paul Brett also contributed his skills.) Columbia Records recognised Harper's potential and hired American producer Shel Talmy to produce Harper's second album, Come Out Fighting Ghengis Smith, which was released in 1968. The 11 minute track "Circle", "a soundscape of Harper's difficult youth", was notable for marking a widening of his musical style away from the more traditional side of contemporary folk music heard at the time. Harper had an interest in traditional folk but did not consider himself a bona fide member of the folk scene. He later explained: Harper's record company had different expectations. "They wanted me to write commercial pop songs and when they heard the album I made for them, they didn’t have a clue. They wanted hits. And I gave them "Circle"". Bert Jansch contributed sleeve notes for the album. During this period, Harper was managed by American music entrepreneur Jo Lustig, manager of The Pentangle and former agent to Julie Felix In June 1968, Harper performed at the first free concert ever held at Hyde Park, acting as compere and sharing the bill with Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd and Tyrannosaurus Rex. At the time, he spoke of co-writing a rock opera with Pink Floyd. No opera resulted, but it was the beginning of a relationship. He began to attract a following of fans from the underground music scene.British Pathe news reel footage of 1968 Hyde Park concert. Britishpathe.com. Retrieved on 5 August 2011. He also toured the UK, performing at numerous venues such as the Lyceum Ballroom, Klooks Kleek and Mothers; venues that would gradually gain recognition for the variety and quality of their musical acts. Mothers in Birmingham was one such venue, and one to which Harper would frequently return. Harper later told Brum Beat magazine:  A track from Come Out Fighting Ghengis Smith also appeared on the first bargain-priced sampler album, The Rock Machine Turns You On. The album was released in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and a number of other European countries as part of an international marketing campaign by Columbia Records (known in Europe as CBS). In 1969 Harper undertook a short 6-venue tour with Ron Geesin and Ralph McTell. The tour programme contained the introductory paragraph: That same year, Harper released his third album Folkjokeopus. The album was again produced by Shel Talmy, and released by Liberty Records. Side two included an extended 17-minute track, titled "McGoohan's Blues", which Harper referred to as the "main statement" within the album. Of his non-conformance to radio-friendly, standard, three-minute songs, Harper claimed it to be a revolt, and that he regarded the three-minute pop song as an anathema, a jingle to sell a band. (The title for "McGoohan's Blues" was a reference to actor Patrick McGoohan, who had starred in the UK TV series The Prisoner two years earlier). The track "Sergeant Sunshine" would also appear on Son of Gutbucket a 1969 sampler album released to promote artists on the Liberty Records label. During this period Harper also visited the Dolphin Club in Oslo, Norway, where he became acquainted with folk singer Lillebjørn Nilsen. Nilsen learned one of Harper's songs, "On the First Day of April" which he translated to "Ravn Ferd" and recorded for his debut solo album Tilbake in 1971. Harper and Nilsen along with Finn Kalvik performed together on 23 January 1970 at a concert held in the University of Oslo. Harper's visit coincided with the emergence of the Norwegian 'folk music wave' (Visebølgen) and the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) undertook a recording of Harper on the occasion of the concert. Kalvik would later go on to record Norwegian versions of two Harper songs; "I Hate the White Man" ("Den hvite mann") and "Don't You Grieve" ("Kjære ikke gråt"). With Harper's reputation growing, Pink Floyd's manager Peter Jenner signed him to a long-term (and at times confrontational) deal with EMI's 'underground' subsidiary, Harvest Records.Roy Harper - Folk Blues & Beyond Over a ten-year period, Harper recorded eight albums at the Abbey Road Studios for the Harvest label and for much of this period was managed and produced by Jenner, initially acting for Blackhill Enterprises. According to Jenner, "Harper is a terrific songwriter, but a bit crazy".Peter Jenner Quote. Folkblues.co.uk. Retrieved on 5 August 2011. Harper's first tour of the United States followed the release of his fourth studio album, Flat Baroque and Berserk. The album included the track "Another Day", a song destined to be performed live by Harper for many years to come, and covered by several other artists including Elizabeth Fraser and Kate Bush. The album also featured the Nice on the track "Hell's Angels"; its ethereal sound achieved by a wah-wah pedal attached to Harper's acoustic guitar. After the Bath Festival of 1970, Led Zeppelin paid tribute to Harper with their version of the traditional song "Shake 'Em on Down". Retitled "Hats Off to (Roy) Harper", it appeared on the album Led Zeppelin III. According to Jimmy Page, the band admired the way Harper stood by his principles and did not sell out to commercial pressures. In mutual appreciation of their work, Harper would often attend live performances by Led Zeppelin over the subsequent decade, contributed sleeve photography to the album Physical Graffiti and also appeared, albeit uncredited, in the 1976 Led Zeppelin documentary film, The Song Remains the Same. Harper's critically acclaimed 1971 album was a four-song epic, Stormcock. The album featured Jimmy Page on guitar (credited as "S. Flavius Mercurius" for contractual reasons) and David Bedford's orchestral arrangements (Bedford would also collaborate on some of Harper's future releases). Harper felt the album to be not particularly well promoted by his record label at the time and later stated:  Nevertheless, Stormcock would remain a favourite album of Harper's fans and influence musicians for decades to come. Thirty-five years later (in 2006) fellow Mancunian Johnny Marr of English alternative rock band the Smiths said:  Joanna Newsom cited Stormcock as an influence upon her 2006 release Ys and in 2011, Robin Pecknold of Seattle, Washington-based folk band Fleet Foxes stated that he took inspiration from Stormcock when recording Fleet Foxes second album Helplessness Blues. In 1972, Harper made his acting debut playing Mike Preston alongside Carol White in the John Mackenzie film Made. The film was chosen (along with A Clockwork Orange) to represent Britain at the Venice Film Festival. Harper also recorded the soundtrack for the film, released the following year as Lifemask. At the time, Lifemask was created as Harper's final bow, as he had been diagnosed with the (then) little-known genetic condition HHT, which caused polycythemia, incapacitating him. The cover art shows Harper's life mask, as opposed to the 'death mask' it might have been. After recovering (treatment involved frequent venesection), his next album (Valentine) was released on Valentine's Day, 14 February 1974, and featured contributions from Jimmy Page. A concert to mark its release was held on the same day at London's Rainbow Theatre, with Page, Bedford, Max Middleton, Ronnie Lane and Keith Moon performing alongside Harper. His first live album Flashes from the Archives of Oblivion, featuring two tracks recorded at that concert, soon followed. Pink Floyd's 1975 release Wish You Were Here saw Harper sing lead vocals on the song "Have a Cigar". Roger Waters intended to record the part himself, but had strained his voice while recording "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" and David Gilmour declined to sing. Harper was recording his album HQ in Studio 2 of Abbey Road at the same time as Pink Floyd were working in Studio 3; learning of the band's dilemma, Harper offered to sing the lead. The song is one of only two songs by Pink Floyd not sung by one of their permanent members. David Gilmour returned the favour by appearing on HQ, along with Harper's occasional backing band, 'Trigger' (Chris Spedding, Dave Cochran, Bill Bruford and John Paul Jones). The single "When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease", taken from HQ, is one of Harper's best known songs. Harper also co-wrote the song "Short and Sweet" with Gilmour for Gilmour's first solo record, David Gilmour, released in 1978. Controversy followed the release of 1977's Bullinamingvase. The owners of Watford Gap service station objected to criticism of their food – "Watford Gap, Watford Gap/A plate of grease and a load of crap..." – in the lyrics of the song "Watford Gap". Harper was forced to drop it from future UK copies of the album, though it remained on the US LP and reappeared on a later CD reissue. The album also featured the song "One of Those Days in England", with backing vocals by Paul McCartney and his wife at the time Linda; the single from the album went to number 42 in the UK charts. During this period, Harper's band were renamed 'Chips' and included Andy Roberts, Dave Lawson, Henry McCullough, John Halsey and Dave Cochran. In April 1978, Harper began writing lyrics for the next Led Zeppelin album with Jimmy Page, but the project was shelved when lead singer Robert Plant returned from a sabbatical after the death of his son, Karac Pendragon. Following the success of Bullinamingvase, Harper was asked "to write another record quickly". Demo recordings with Harper's newly formed backing band 'Black Sheep' (Andy Roberts, Dave Lawson, Henry McCullough, John Halsey and Dave Cochran, a.k.a. Dave C. Drill) were made, but Harper felt them to be rushed. The record company who "...were in the first stages of a collapse in sales..." were not interested in the recordings, nor were they prepared to provide studio time when requested, telling Harper to come back in six months. As a result, Harper withheld the publishing rights to that which had been recorded; an album provisionally entitled Commercial Breaks (doesn't it?) and was (in his own words) "outlawed" by the record company. From 1975 to 1980 Harper worked with English musician and 'Black Sheep' member Andy Roberts sometimes performing as a duo. During this period, Harper spent considerable time in the United States and signed with the US division of Chrysalis Records, who released HQ with a different title – When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease – and with alternative artwork. Chrysalis considered the original Hipgnosis-designed album cover of Harper walking on water to be too offensive for an American release. Harper disagreed, but was given no choice by the label. Chrysalis also changed the title of Harper's next album, Bullinamingvase, to One of Those Days in England. In 1978, US Chrysalis reissued Harper's first five Harvest albums, only one of which (Flat, Baroque and Berserk) had been previously released in America. On 28 December 1979, BBC TV aired the Kate Bush Christmas Special."Kate Bush Christmas Special" Cast and Crew at IMDb As well as playing songs from her first two albums, Bush and her guest, Peter Gabriel, performed Harper's "Another Day". Their duet was discussed for release as a single, but never appeared. Harper returned to the studio a few years after his dispute with EMI to record and prepare his next album The Unknown Soldier (1980). At the time, Harper knew it would be his last release on the label and it was these demos that "...were destined to gather dust on a shelf labelled 'Commercial Breaks'...". (It was not until Harper's 1988 release Loony on the Bus that some of these songs became officially available, and another six years until the album was finally released as Commercial Breaks (1994)). In 1980 Harper released The Unknown Soldier, which was indeed his final Harvest release. The album contains a duet with Kate Bush on the track "You". Harper later reciprocated by singing backing vocals on "Breathing" on Bush's album Never For Ever; Bush's first no.&nbsp;1 album, the first ever album by a British female solo artist to top the UK album chart, and the first album by any female solo artist to enter the chart at no.&nbsp;1.Kate Bush Never for Ever chart history Bush thanked Harper on the album's cover for "holding onto the poet in his music". During a BBC Radio interview by Paul Gambaccini, Bush praised Harper, stating:  Of Bush, Harper later said,  A decade later, Harper and Bush would again collaborate on his 1990 release Once. Harper's 1982 album Work of Heart was released on Public Records, a newly formed record label Harper created with Mark Thompson (son of English historian, socialist and peace campaigner E.P. Thompson and brother of Kate Thompson). During this period Harper toured with a band consisting of Tony Franklin on Bass, Bob Wilson of the Steve Gibbons Band, George Jackson on drums and Dave Morris on keyboards. The album was chosen by Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times as "Album of the Year" in 1982, but it did not sell well and the short-lived label went under. During this period Harper lost his home, a farm in the village of Marden, Herefordshire, to the bank. His manager at the time mortgaged Harper's house (by virtue of the Power of Attorney Harper had granted him), pocketed the proceeds and disappeared to America. Of this period Harper stated:  The original demo version of Work of Heart was later released (in 1984) on a limited edition (830 copies) vinyl release entitled Born in Captivity. Throughout 1984, Harper toured the United Kingdom with Jimmy Page performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors, and Themselves. In 1985, Whatever Happened to Jugula? was released. The album caused a resurgence of interest in Harper and his music. (Tony Franklin, bass player in Harper's group at this time, later joined Page in the Firm). In April 1984, Harper and Gilmour performed "Short and Sweet" (a song they co-wrote) during Gilmour's three-night run at The Hammersmith Odeon. This version later appeared on the David Gilmour Live 1984 concert film. Harper also provided backing vocals on Gilmour's newly released album, About Face. On 20 June 1984 Harper performed at the last Stonehenge Free Festival along with Hawkwind and the Enid. The concert was videoed and released as Stonehenge 84. As a result of his continual touring and the popularity of Whatever Happened to Jugula?, Harper re-signed to EMI and in 1986 released a live album, In Between Every Line (containing recordings from his performances at the Cambridge Folk Festival), and in 1988 the studio album, Descendants of Smith. The renewed relationship between Harper and EMI did not last and from 1985 more of his earlier albums were becoming available on the newly formed Awareness Records label. 1988 also saw the release of Loony on the Bus, a collection of tracks recorded a decade earlier and intended for release in 1977 as Commercial Breaks (with the sub-title, 'doesn't it?'). The original release having been held back because of disputes over funding and content between Harper and EMI. Sales of Loony on the Bus would fund Harper's 1990 release; Once. In 1993 Harper established his own record label Science Friction and obtained the rights to all his previously released albums. As a result, from 1994 much of Harper's back catalogue became available on CD once more. Harper was very productive during the decade, releasing five studio albums: Once (1990), Death or Glory? (1992), Commercial Breaks (1994), The Dream Society (1998), a collection of poetry and spoken word tracks Poems, Speeches, Thoughts and Doodles (1997); two live albums: Unhinged (1993) and Live At Les Cousins (1996) and six individual CDs of live concerts and sessions recorded by the BBC (1997). Two official C90 cassette tapes of concerts at the Red Lion in Birmingham (1984 & 1985) were made available from Harper's agency (Acorn Entertainments). In addition, Harper released a live video Once (1990), an EP Burn the World (1990), a 4-track CD single Death or Glory? (1992), a limited edition live cassette Born in Captivity II (1992) (featuring cricketer Graeme Fowler and a cricket poem written by Harper: "Three Hundred Words"), a compilation album An Introduction to ..... (1994), and a reissue of Descendants of Smith (his 1988 release) renamed Garden of Uranium (1994). Once again Harper collaborated with David Gilmour and Kate Bush on his 1990 release, Once. The album also featured contributions from Nigel Mazlyn Jones, Mark Feltham and Tony Franklin. One of the album tracks, "The Black Cloud of Islam" a song written about Colonel Gaddafi, the Lockerbie bombing, and a despairing castigation of radical Islam, provoked criticism from some of Harper's fans at the time. Whilst religion, Harper's "first and only enemy" has always been a recurring theme in his music, he was 'red-carded by a lot of his 1990 following... who left in substantial numbers'. In 1992, his second marriage ended and Harper released Death or Glory? an album that (upon its original release) contained a number of songs and spoken word pieces referencing his loss and pain. "She ran off with someone else" said Harper, "a violin player (Nigel Kennedy) I’d been working on an adaptation of Brahms's Violin Concerto with. I was really traumatised by that. Anybody who’s been suddenly left like that will know it’s very, very traumatic. I managed to come out of it, but it took about five years. It was like a death, a loss, like being told your child’s been killed in a war. There’s no other way to describe it. When you go through that, it changes your life forever, there’s no point in not admitting it. I withdrew, retreated, became an exile". Throughout the decade, Harper's musical influence began to be recognised by a younger generation of musicians, some of whom covered his songs or invited him to make guest appearances on their albums. In 1995 Harper contributed spoken words on the Tea Party's 1995 album The Edges of Twilight, and appeared on stage for their New Year concert in Montreal. In 1996 Roy recited "Bad Speech" from his album Whatever Happened to Jugula? on Anathemas album Eternity (the album also contains a cover version of "Hope" from the same album). The track "Time" from The Tea Party's 1996 multimedia CD, Alhambra, was sung and co-written by Harper. Harper contributed his version of Jethro Tull's song, "Up the 'Pool" (from Living in the Past) for the 1996 tribute album, To Cry You A Song - A Collection Of Tull Tales, a version Anderson liked so much, he began to perform the "forgotten piece" again in concert. In 1998, Jethro Tull singer Ian Anderson contributed flute to the song, "These Fifty Years" on Harper's The Dream Society, an album based on emotional, philosophical and actual events in Harper's life. Views of procreation, his mother's continued presence in him and something of his psychological impulses are punctuated by a couple of moments of satire, a love song and a lament, followed by the lengthy "These Fifty years", of which he has said, "In some ways its (anti-organised religion) theme is similar to 'The Same Old Rock', but in many others I think it's stronger". Reportedly, Anderson said that the only reason he originally left Blackpool was because Harper did. Other artists who covered Harper's songs (or songs on his albums) throughout the decade include Dean Carter, Ava Cherry & The Astronettes, Green Crown, The Kitchen Cynics, the Levellers, Roydan Styles and Pete Townshend.Roy Harper Fan Site.

In 2000, Harper released an almost entirely acoustic album, The Green Man, accompanied by the Tea Party's Jeff Martin on guitar, hurdy-gurdy and numerous other instruments. The following year (2001) Harper celebrated his 60th birthday with a concert performance at London's Royal Festival Hall and was joined by numerous guest artists including; David Bedford, Nick Harper, Jeff Martin and John Renbourn. The concert was recorded and released shortly after as a double CD, Royal Festival Hall Live – June 10th 2001. In 2003, Harper published The Passions of Great Fortune, a large format book containing all the lyrics to his albums (and singles) to date, it also contained a wealth of photographs and commentary on his songs. Harper released his second CD single in April 2005; "The Death of God". The 13 minute song, a critique of the war in Iraq, featured guest guitarist Matt Churchill (who also performed live with Harper during this period). A video of the track, intermixing animation with a live performance, is . 2003 also saw the release of Counter Culture, a double compilation album featuring songs from Harper's 35 year songwriting period. Counter Culture received a five-star review from UNCUT magazine.

In September 2007, Harper supported Californian harpist Joanna Newsom at her Royal Albert Hall performance. Newsom, impressed by Harper's 1971 album Stormcock found it served as an inspiration for her similarly expansive second album, Ys. During his Royal Albert Hall appearance with Newsom, Harper played Stormcock in its entirety. At the time, Harper made an announcement on his website that he was "...taking a break from the live scene... retired from gigging..." and just wanted "...the time and space to write..." During this period, Harper dedicated his time to collecting and compiling his life's work in various formats. One of the intended projects was to be the making of a documentary DVD to round off this process. However, as of 2016 this remains unreleased. In 2008, plans were announced for a Roy Harper tribute album. The album, What You Need Is What You Have, The Songs of Roy Harper was being compiled by Laurel Canyon folk singer, musician and producer Jonathan Wilson, and was to feature Chris Robinson (the Black Crowes), Gary Louris (the Jayhawks), Johnathan Rice, Eric Johnson (Fruit Bats, the Shins), Benji Hughes, Will Oldham, Andy Cabic, Dawes, Jenny O., Josh Tillman and others.

The trial started on 20 January 2015 and on 5 February 2015 Harper was unanimously acquitted by a jury of indecent assault. The following day, Harper was cleared of a second charge of indecent assault, and the jury at Worcester Crown Court was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the remaining charges. According to the BBC, the judge Robert Juckes QC then gave the prosecution two weeks to consider whether they wished to seek a re-trial on the undecided charges,  but it wasn't until 9 November 2015 that the prosecution announced that they were dropping all allegations of sexual abuse against Harper and the Crown Prosecution Service would offer no evidence against him following a review by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders. Outside court, in a statement issued by his legal team, Harper said he had always maintained his innocence and that "the case should never have gone as far as this, or taken so long to resolve. The psychological and personal cost to my wife and myself has been enormous and the financial cost hugely unfair. I lost my livelihood and I spent my savings... and more, on my defence... I thank my lawyers for standing by me and working so hard to show the truth. Despite coming out of this without a blemish on my name, I cannot recoup my costs and that’s left me incredibly angry. I’m now going to restart my working life where I left off nearly three years ago." One of Harper's sons, Nick Harper, is a singer-songwriter.
