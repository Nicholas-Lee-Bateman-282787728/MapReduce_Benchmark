The first inhabitants of the area known as Old Bridge, were the Lenni Lenape Native Americans.  Those who settled in Old Bridge were known as the Unami, or "people down the river." They, like many people today, migrated to the shore along the Raritan each summer from their hunting grounds in the north. When the English gained control from the Dutch in 1664, the state was divided into two provinces, East Jersey and West Jersey.  In 1683, the general assembly of East Jersey defined the boundaries of Middlesex County and the three other original counties (Bergen, Essex and Monmouth) as containing all plantations on both sides of the Raritan River, as far as Cheesequake Harbor to the east, then southwest to the Provincial line, with the southwest line being the border of Monmouth and Middlesex Counties and the Township's southern border.De Angelo, Walter A.

Middlesex County’s original boundaries ran from the Essex County line eastward as far as Cheesequake Harbour, then southwest to the boundary between the provinces of East and West Jersey, and then northwest to the provincial boundary of East Jersey." Thomas Warne, one of the original 24 proprietors of East Jersey, was listed as a landowner of this area, and his son is said to have been the earliest white resident residing in the Cheesequake area in 1683.  John and Susannah Brown were granted a  land grant from the King of England in 1737.  They called the area Brownville, and today this part of town is now known as Browntown. Other important proprietors of Old Bridge were the Bowne, Morgan, Letts, Brown, Tone, Herbert and Cottrell families, who date back as some of the first landowners of Old Bridge. In 1684, South Amboy Township was formed. At that time, it covered an area that now consists of the Townships of Monroe and Old Bridge, the Borough of Sayreville and the City of South Amboy. The Township covers  that separated from South Amboy on March 2, 1869, and was originally called Madison Township.Snyder, John P.

Fulling was used as a finishing process used on woolen cloth that would remove the dirt and grease and to compact the wool fibers.  The mill is said to have been run behind Old Bridge High School and flows east into the Matawan Creek.  The area of Old Bridge was also known for their numerous snuff mills.  The Washington Snuff mill (later renamed the Dill Snuff Mill) was established in 1801 and was located on Mount Pleasant and Old Bridge Turnpike (now Route 516). Snuff is a scented tobacco product that was used by men and women during that time period.Disbrow Martin, Alvia. At the Headwaters of Cheesequake Creek.

"Fine clay had surrounded Cheesequake Creek when the Lenni Lenape Native Americans lived there.  The early discoveries of clay along the banks opened the clay industry to Middlesex County as well as the state of New Jersey.  By the 1800s clay was a major industry.  The clay deposits found along Cheesequake Creek are reported to be some of the finest stoneware clays in the United States."  The clay supplied local potters as well as those in Hudson Valley, Norwalk, Connecticut, other New England states, and parts of Canada.  The earliest use of clay from this area was used by Captain James Morgan before the Revolution.  The Perrine clay pit was located near U.S. Route 9 and Ernston Road. The Cottrell homestead is a landmark in Old Bridge. It was built in 1831 and still stands today on the northeast corner of County Route 516 and Cottrell Road. The Cottrells owned a  apple orchard that was located across the street from their home. Apples that could not be used because of their size or quality did not go to waste. Across from the cold-storage building on the southwest corner of Cottrell Road and Route 516 (where Rite Aid is now located), the family built the New Jersey Apple Growers Inc. distillery. It was at this distillery that they pressed the apples into cider and distilled the brandy in large vats. The brandy would age in barrels in a government warehouse that was located on the Cottrells' property. The Cottrells produced apple brandy for twenty years on the farm and sold it wholesale to distributors under the name Browntown.
