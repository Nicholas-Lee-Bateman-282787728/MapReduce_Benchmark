The main neighborhoods are taken from the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West).  Trenton was once home to large Italian, Hungarian, and Jewish communities, but since the 1950s demographic shifts have changed the city into a relatively segregated urban enclave of middle and lower income African Americans. Italians are scattered throughout the city, but a distinct Italian community is centered in the Chambersburg neighborhood, in South Trenton.Di Ionno, Mark.

"The difference between Chambersburg, the traditional Italian section of Trenton, and other city neighborhoods that have undergone 'natural progression' is that Chambersburg hung on so long." This community has been in decline since the 1970s, largely due to economic and social shifts to the more prosperous, less crime-ridden suburbs surrounding the city.  Today Chambersburg has a large Latino community.  Many of the Latino immigrants are from Mexico, Guatemala and Nicaragua. There is also a significant and growing  Asian community in the Chambersburg neighborhood primarily made up of Burmese and Bhutanese/Nepali refugees. The North Ward, once a mecca for the city's middle class, is now one of the most economically distressed, torn apart by race riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968. Nonetheless, the area still retains many important architectural and historic sites. North Trenton still has a large Polish-American neighborhood that borders Lawrence Township, many of whom attend St Hedwig's Roman Catholic Church on Brunswick Ave.  St. Hedwig's church was built in 1904 by Polish immigrants, many of whose families still attend the church. North Trenton is also home to the historic Shiloh Baptist Church—one of the largest houses of worship in Trenton and the oldest African American church in the city, founded in 1888. The church is currently pastored by Rev. Darrell L. Armstrong, who carried the Olympic torch in 2002 for the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.  Also located just at the southern tip of North Trenton is the city's Battle Monument, also known as "Five Points". It is a  structure that marks the spot where George Washington's Continental Army launched the Battle of Trenton during the American Revolutionary War. It faces downtown Trenton and is a symbol of the city's historic past. South Ward is the most diverse neighborhood in Trenton and is home to many Latin American, Italian-American, and African American residents. East Ward is the smallest neighborhood in Trenton and is home to the Trenton Transit Center and Trenton Central High School.

The Trenton Riots of 1968 were a major civil disturbance that took place during the week following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King in Memphis on April 4. Race riots broke out nationwide following the murder of the civil rights activist. More than 200 Trenton businesses, mostly in Downtown, were ransacked and burned. More than 300 people, most of them young black men, were arrested on charges ranging from assault and arson to looting and violating the mayor's emergency curfew. In addition to 16 injured policemen, 15 firefighters were treated at city hospitals for smoke inhalation, burns, sprains and cuts suffered while fighting raging blazes or for injuries inflicted by rioters.  Denizens of Trenton's urban core often pulled false alarms and would then throw bricks at firefighters responding to the alarm boxes.  This experience, along with similar experiences in other major cities, effectively ended the use of open-cab fire engines.  As an interim measure, the Trenton Fire Department fabricated temporary cab enclosures from steel deck plating until new equipment could be obtained. The losses incurred by downtown businesses were initially estimated by the city to be $7 million, but the total of insurance claims and settlements came to $2.5 million.Cumbler, John T.
