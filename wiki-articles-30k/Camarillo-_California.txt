   Camarillo ( ) is a city in Ventura County in the U.S. state of California. The population was 65,201 at the 2010 census, up from 57,084 at the 2000 census. The Ventura Freeway (U.S. Route 101) is the city's primary thoroughfare. Camarillo is named for Adolfo and Juan Camarillo, two of the few Californios (pre-1848 California natives of Hispanic ancestry) to preserve the city's heritage after the arrival of Anglo settlers. The railroad coast route came through in 1898 and built a station here. Adolfo Camarillo eventually employed 700 workers growing mainly lima beans. Walnuts and citrus were also grown on the ranch. Adolfo bred Camarillo White Horses in the 1920s through the 1960s and was well known for riding them, dressed in colorful Spanish attire, in parades such as the Fiesta of Santa Barbara. The city grew slowly prior to World War II but the war effort saw the construction of the Oxnard Army Air Field (later Oxnard Air Force Base in 1951, now Camarillo Airport) to the west of town. The community also grew as the new base along with nearby Naval Air Station Point Mugu and a Seabee base at Port Hueneme brought many workers and their families to the area. The grounds of Camarillo State Hospital, which opened in 1936 south of town, is now the campus of California State University, Channel Islands. As with most cities in Ventura County, it is noted for its resistance to new development. In 2014, the council voted against an 895-acre project that would have extended development on agricultural lands east towards the Conejo Grade.Harris, Mike (September 10, 2014) "Camarillo council kills plans for large development" Ventura County Star  Camarillo is located at  (34.2256, −119.0322).

Camarillo and the surrounding area has a temperate, Mediterranean-type climate. Its location in a coastal valley brings mild ocean breezes and temperatures in the 70s throughout most of the year. An average rainfall of  occurs primarily from November to February. The city has over 300 days of sunshine a year and an average humidity of 62%. Snow has only fallen about 3 times in the last thirty years and is seldom more than a dusting. Snow is often visible during the winter months above the  level in the mountains to the north. The proximity of the ocean sometimes causes morning fog in the spring and early summer. Camarillo is primarily a bedroom community made up of large housing tracts, with elementary schools and small strip malls serving the neighborhood. The primary public high schools serving Camarillo are Adolfo Camarillo High School in Mission Oaks, and Rio Mesa High School in Strickland between Oxnard and Camarillo. Both are part of the Oxnard Union High School District which is building Rancho Campana High School near the intersection of Lewis Road and Las Posas Road and scheduled to be completed by the fall semester of 2015.Leung, Wendy (September 11, 2014) "Rancho Campana High student application process begins next month" Ventura County Star The private Cornerstone Christian School is also located in Camarillo. The Boys and Girls Club of Camarillo has been open since 1967. The Club serves close to 400 kids per day and is primarily funded by donations from the Community. The YMCA has a facility on Village at the Park Drive, and a new library was constructed and opened on March 31, 2007. Many sports leagues, including adult leagues, such as baseball, basketball, football, and the largest AYSO soccer league west of the Mississippi are located in Camarillo. An outdoor in-line hockey rink is in Freedom Park, near the Camarillo Airport. The incidence of all types of crime committed in the city is far below the national average.  The Pleasant Valley Recreation & Park District (PVRPD, www.pvrpd.org) is an independent Special-purpose district located in Ventura County, California.[ ] The District is located in and around the City of Camarillo, serves a population of over 70,000 and covers an area approximately 45 square miles . It has grown from one park and 30 acres to 27 parks and over 300 acres since its inception in 1962. PVRPD was incorporated prior to the City of Camarillo. Within the District, a variety of recreational facilities exist including: The District is a separate government agency from the City of Camarillo. The boundaries of the District also varies from the City of Camarillo. The District is governed by publicly elected Board of Directors and is managed by a General Manager. The Pleasant Valley Recreation & Park District is funded by local property taxes and fees to provide and maintain parks and outdoor recreational facilities for the enjoyment of all Camarillo citizens. Formed in January 1962 under the State Public Resource Code of California.[ ] The creation of the District was approved by voters to provide programs, parks and facilities that can be used by the community. The Pleasant Valley and Recreation and Park District has hosted the Camarillo Christmas Parade since 1962. The Christmas Parade usually occurs during the first or second weekend in December. Hundreds of organizations and thousands of people participate in the parade. Community Members come from all over to watch the parade. Notable Grand Marshals have been: Camarillo resident Walter Brennan also had been a grand marshal in the 1970s. At the city's incorporation in 1964, a council-manager form of government was created. The five member city council is elected at large for four-year terms. The council is responsible for establishing policy, enacting laws and making legal and financial decisions for the city. A city manager, hired by the council and answerable to it, is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the city. He is charged with overall management of the five city departments and 97 full-time employees. Services such as water, sewer, trash collection, street maintenance and traffic engineering are provided by a combination of contractors and city employees. As of December 2014, the mayor of Camarillo is Bill Little. Police services are provided by the Ventura County Sheriff's Department under contract to the city, headquartered in a police station owned by the city. The Sheriff's department helicopter fleet is hangared at Camarillo Airport. Ventura County Fire Department provides fire protection, with four stations within the city limits. The major source of city funding is sales tax revenue. The mix of retail and commercial businesses in the city provides a stable tax base. The recent addition of a Factory Outlet Center and a new shopping center has added significantly to the sales tax revenues. The Chumash Indians were the first known settlers in what is now known as Ventura County. Fishermen built their villages along the Pacific Coast near the mouths of the Calleguas Creek and Santa Clara River. Artifacts from their settlements are on display in the Ventura County Historical Museum and their paintings are still visible on canyon walls and in caves in the area. The Portuguese navigator Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, while exploring the Pacific coast for the king of Spain, came upon the Chumash in an area near Point Mugu. He explored the surrounding region and claimed it in the name of Spain in 1542. Cabrillo was followed in 1602 by Sebastian Viscaino on a mapping expedition for the King of Spain. The Chumash continued to inhabit the coast until 1768 when Russians, having established a settlement  to the north, launched expeditions challenging the Spanish land claims. In the 18th century, the Spanish began settling California and built the first of what would become a chain of 21 missions in San Diego. Father Junípero Serra establish the ninth mission in Ventura in 1782 bringing more settlers to the area and exposing the Indians who had settled around the mission to many European diseases to which they had no immunity. Their numbers diminished until the Chumash, once the largest Indian nation in California, had largely vanished by 1839. By the early 1820s, Mexico had gained independence from Spain, and shortly afterward California allied itself with Mexico. The Mexican land grant system was liberalized in 1824 resulting in many large grants in California and the proliferation of Ranchos north of the border. One grant to José Pedro Ruiz created Rancho Calleguas in 1837, in the area that is now Camarillo. The grant was later sold to Juan Camarillo, who had arrived in 1834 as a member of the Hijar-Padres Expedition; it was his sons Adolfo and Juan that are credited with the founding of the town that was to bear their name. The earlier proposed name of Calleguas was rejected as too difficult to pronounce. At about same time, the town of Springville had begun to form just to the west of the emerging town of Camarillo on the main road to Ventura which is now the intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Wood Road. The Springville Post Office, which was open from 1875 to 1903, was one of seventeen post offices operating in the county in 1890.Post Offices in Ventura, Hueneme, Santa Paula, Saticoy, and Nordoff provided money order service (Ventura also handled International exchange). Ventura County settlements with a Post Office in 1890 also included Bardsdale, Camulos, Fillmore, Matilija, Montalvo, Newbury Park, New Jerusalem, Piru City, Punta Gorda, Simi, Springville, and Timberville. The Springville School District was established in 1887(December 2014) "Historic Context Statement and Reconnaissance Survey for the Eastern Oxnard Plain" Santa Paula, California: San Buenaventura Research Associates – Prepared for County of Ventura Planning Division and adopted by Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board and the grammar school was south of the settlement on the main road (now Pleasant Valley Road) to the new wharf at Hueneme where schooners brought lumber from the north and carried grain, lima beans and sheep to markets in San Francisco. Springville's existence was threatened though when the Southern Pacific Railroad Coast Route was routed farther south through Pleasant Valley and a depot was established in nearby Camarillo. The settlement disappeared but in 2012 a new road was named Springville Drive to honor the little town and is now marked on the 101 freeway with an overpass and ramps at the western end of Camarillo. The original settlement would have been nearby on the south side of the freeway. Don Juan Camarillo, brother of Adolfo, donated  to be used as a seminary to be named in honor of Saint John the Evangelist. The Roman Catholic seminary was founded in 1927 as St. John's Seminary. Camarillo's growth was slow from founding through World War II. In the late 1940s, building lots on Ventura Boulevard, the main downtown street, were being offered for $450 and home lots on the adjoining streets were $250, with few buyers. Travel to and from Los Angeles was difficult, owing to the narrow, tortuous road climbing the Conejo Grade to the east of the city. The main industry during this period was agriculture, and the area surrounding the small town was blanketed with orange, lemon and walnut groves. The State Mental hospital south of the town was the largest employer. A few houses had sprung up to the north and south of town center. The Oxnard Army Air Field, built during World War II to the west of town, the Navy Facility at Point Mugu and the Seabee base at Port Hueneme brought many military personnel to the area, but there was little private industry or other source of non-agricultural employment.  Oxnard AAF closed at the end of World War II, but the Navy facilities remained open.  With the Korean War and associated Cold War tensions, the former Oxnard AAF was reactivated in 1951 as Oxnard Air Force Base. In the mid-1950s, the Ventura Freeway, which bisects the town, was completed from Los Angeles to points north, making it an easy one-hour trip to Camarillo. The freeway was originally planned to follow the path of Potrero Road, south of Camarillo, which would have completely by-passed the soon-to-be city. However, after much debate, city officials persuaded Caltrans to lay the freeway parallel to Ventura Boulevard, creating the infamously steep descent from the Santa Monica Mountains, known as the Conejo Grade. The grade is about  and posted as a 7% grade—which translates as about one thousand feet of elevation change in less than three miles (70 meters per kilometer). There is a California Highway Patrol brake inspection station at the top of the grade and a stop is mandatory for all 18-wheel trucks. The completion of the freeway facilitated the growth that followed. In 1962, the population was 7,500 and 3M began construction for the Mincom and Magnetic Tape Divisions, which would ultimately employ 900 people, becoming the largest local employer. That plant briefly housed a factory for 3M spinoff Imation before being closed in 2008. Housing tracts were built where orchards once stood. House prices were $14,000 to $65,000. At this time plans were made for the incorporation of the city to control the rapid expansion. Camarillo became a city in 1964 and soon put into place a General Plan and building codes that were to lead to an attractive city environment. In 1964 the closest traffic signal was  from the City center on the road to Point Mugu, and the first shopping center and supermarket were under construction. Because of the late date of city incorporation, the local telephone exchange is still listed as part of Oxnard. Much of the city was expected to be developed to the south of Ventura Blvd, however it was to the north that the new city grew, and the land south of Ventura Blvd remains reserved for agricultural use to this day. Many of the home buyers during the 1960s were military veterans, who had been stationed at one of the local bases during their service. The temperate climate and the living conditions lured them back. With the establishment of both the Pacific Missile Range at NAS Point Mugu and the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory at Port Hueneme many found employment that utilized their military training. Other newcomers were those who worked and lived in the San Fernando Valley and were willing to endure the commute for the opportunity to raise their families in a smog-free, semirural environment. Still others relocated here with their employers, like 3M, and Harbor Freight Tools who built facilities in and around the city to take advantage of the large workforce. Technicolor Video Services Inc. is the largest DVD duplicator in the world.[ ]   The members of the original city council (1964) were Ned Chatfield, Stan Daily, Earl Joseph, Tweedy Rouce & Guy Turner. Camarillo State Mental Hospital was established near the city in the 1930s so that persons suffering from mental illnesses or tuberculosis could recover in Ventura County's balmy climate. Jazzman Charlie Parker's "Relaxin' at Camarillo," written while he was detoxing from heroin addiction, is a tribute to the facility. The song "Camarillo" by punk outfit Fear is also written about the facility. The band Ambrosia released a song called "Ready for Camarillo" on their 1978 Life Beyond L.A. album. "Ready for Camarillo" also appeared as the single B side of their hit "How Much I Feel." The former hospital is the now the site of California State University, Channel Islands. The University has retained the distinctive Mission Revival Style architecture bell tower in the South quad. The band Brazzaville released a video called "Camarillo" in 2007, with mental hospital-like imagery and lyrics concerning lead singer David Brown's relatives' stay in the institution. The Camarillo State Hospital was closed in the 1990s and remained vacant until the site was converted into California State University, Channel Islands (CSUCI). CSUCI officially opened in August 2002 and is now accredited by the WASC. Mission Oaks is the name given by developer Pardee Homes to a  parcel of land located in the north-eastern portion of the city. This parcel was developed as a planned community over the span of 35 years, and was completed in October 2004.Pardee Homes (October 20, 2004). Pardee To Conclude Mission Oaks In Camarillo. Press release.   The area developed by Pardee Homes makes up approximately 15% of Camarillo's total land. Due to the decades-long timescale of the project, many residents are unaware of Mission Oaks' proprietary nature, and the area east of Lewis Road (State Route 34), south of Somis and north of the 101 Freeway is generally thought of as Mission Oaks regardless of which company built the buildings in the area.Rochester, Teresa (May 7, 2014) "As Camarillo turns 50, new wave of construction is underway" In the mid-1990s, multiple large retail centers, including one of California's largest outlet malls and movie theater were built south of US 101 and west of Carmen Drive. These new retail centers have provided a large influx of cash to the city; from 1993 to 1998 sales tax revenues nearly doubled from approximately $3.5 million to approximately $6.5 million.William Fulton (2000). Sales and Property Tax Trends In Ventura County, 1987–1998. Retrieved April 14, 2006.

The new center has 45 stores and restaurants, bringing the total to about 160  Beginning 7:02 am. on Thursday, May 2, 2013, a major brush fire began in the Camarillo Springs area and burned throughout the area. The community of Dos Vientos and CSUCI were evacuated due to the proximity of the fire. About 15 houses were damaged, but none burned down. 28,000 acres of land was burned by the fire. Finally, on Sunday, May 5, 2013, rain in the area during the night helped firefighters bring the fire under full control.  Semtech and Salem Communications are based in Camarillo.  Camarillo Airport  is a public airport located  west of the central business district of Camarillo. The airport has one runway and exclusively serves privately operated general aviation and executive aircraft with no scheduled commercial service. The airport was originally established in 1942 when the California State Highway Department constructed an auxiliary landing field with a  runway, which was later extended to  in 1951 to accommodate what by then had developed into Oxnard Air Force Base. The airport runway was further extended in 1959 to accommodate jet fighter aircraft such as the Northrop F-89 and McDonnell F-101B, used as part of the Los Angeles area Air Defense network. In Mid-1960s the base received 17 new F-106 Delta Darts. On January 1, 1970, Oxnard AFB was deactivated and the base became surplus property. Oxnard had 99 Officers and 990 enlisted assigned prior to its closing in 1970. The last commanding officer of the 414th Fighter Group was Colonel Paul D. Cofer. The transfer of the airport to Ventura County was approved by the Department of Defense in 1976. Camarillo Airport also serves as the base of operations of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department Aviation Unit and the home of the VCSD's Training Facility and Academy, the Ventura County Criminal Justice Training Center. The Camarillo Airport also serves as the base of operations for the Ventura County Fire Department and facilitates the Oxnard College Regional Fire Academy and the Ventura County Reserve Officers Training Center.  Camarillo has one train station, served by both Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner from San Luis Obispo to San Diego and Metrolink's Ventura County Line from Los Angeles Union Station to Montalvo. Nine Pacific Surfliner trains serve the station daily and six Metrolink trains serve the station each weekday. This limited Metrolink service runs only at peak hours in the peak direction of travel (i.e. three morning departures to Los Angeles and three evening arrivals from Los Angeles). CAT operates one scheduled bus line on Monday through Friday within Camarillo, and Dial-A-Ride services for the disabled on Monday through Saturday. VISTA operates buses between Camarillo and several nearby cities, including the Conejo Express to the Warner Center area in western Los Angeles County. A rural region northeast of Camarillo, California may be referred to as Santa Rosa or Camrosa. Camrosa is believed to be a contraction of Camarillo and Santa Rosa. The area includes just over a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) distance along Santa Rosa Road from the city limit east to Moorpark Road. The area is unincorporated as of 2007. Wired telephone service to the area comes from the Camarillo telephone exchange, while homes on the hillside overlooking the valley (from the south) are from Thousand Oaks.Santa Rosa Road is misidentified as Camarillo Road on the 1967 edition of the USGS Newbury Park, California 7.5-minute quadrangle (map). Regulatory filings show addresses along this street on Santa Rosa Road. Geographic features supporting these names include: This Santa Rosa is not the same as the Sonoma County city of the same name. Notable current and former residents of Camarillo include, in alphabetical order: The motion pictures Coming Home, Pearl Harbor, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Iron Eagle, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, and Friday the 13th: A New Beginning were filmed in Camarillo. The well used in the film The Ring is also located in Camarillo Camarillo is sometimes mentioned in literature because of the mental hospital once located there. In Jack Kerouac's The Dharma Bums, he mentions a place "...somewhere near Camarillo where Charlie Parker'd been mad and relaxed back to normal health" (The Dharma Bums, 1). Frank Zappa referred to the city in his 1973 song "Camarillo Brillo". The city's name is mispronounced so as to rhyme with the second word in the song's title.
