 Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move one's body to stop uncomfortable or odd sensations. It most commonly affects the legs, but can affect the arms, torso, head, and even phantom limbs. Moving the affected body part modulates the sensations, providing temporary relief. RLS sensations range from pain or an aching in the muscles, to "an itch you can't scratch," a "buzzing sensation," an unpleasant "tickle that won't stop," a "crawling" feeling, or limbs jerking while awake. The sensations typically begin or intensify during quiet wakefulness, such as when relaxing, reading, studying, or trying to sleep. Additionally, most individuals with RLS have periodic limb movement disorder (limbs jerking during sleep), which is an objective physiologic marker of the disorder and is associated with sleep disruption. It can be caused by low iron levels. Treatment is often with levodopa or a dopamine agonist such as pramipexole. Some controversy surrounds the marketing of drug treatments for RLS. It is a "spectrum" disease with some people experiencing only a minor annoyance and others having major disruption of sleep and impairments in quality of life. The sensations—and the need to move—may return immediately after ceasing movement or at a later time. RLS may start at any age, including childhood, and is a progressive disease for some, while the symptoms may remit in others. In a survey among members of the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation, it was found that up to 45% of patients had their first symptoms before the age of 20 years. The sensations are unusual and unlike other common sensations. Those with RLS have a hard time describing them, using words like: uncomfortable, painful, 'antsy', electrical, creeping, itching, pins and needles, pulling, crawling, buzzing, and numbness. It is sometimes described similar to a limb 'falling asleep' or an exaggerated sense of positional awareness of the affected area.  The sensation and the urge can occur in any body part; the most cited location is legs, followed by arms. Some people have little or no sensation, yet still have a strong urge to move. Movement usually brings immediate relief, although temporary and partial. Walking is most common; however, stretching, yoga, biking, or other physical activity may relieve the symptoms. Continuous, fast up-and-down movements of the leg, and/or rapidly moving the legs toward then away from each other, may keep sensations at bay without having to walk. Specific movements may be unique to each person. Sitting or lying down (reading, plane ride, watching TV) can trigger the sensations and urge to move. Severity depends on the severity of the person's RLS, the degree of restfulness, duration of the inactivity, etc. Some experience RLS only at bedtime, while others experience it throughout the day and night. Most people experience the worst symptoms in the evening and the least in the morning. These symptoms of RLS can make sleeping difficult for many patients and a recent poll shows the presence of significant daytime difficulties resulting from this condition.  These problems range from being late for work to missing work or events because of drowsiness.  Patients with RLS who responded reported driving while drowsy more than patients without RLS.  These daytime difficulties can translate into safety, social and economic issues for the patient and for society. Individuals with RLS have higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders. RLS is categorized as either primary or secondary. The most commonly associated medical condition is iron deficiency (specifically blood ferritin below 50&nbsp;µg/L), which accounts for 20% of all cases of RLS.  A study published in 2007 noted that RLS features were observed in 34% of patients having iron deficiency as against 6% of controls. Conversely, 75% of individuals with RLS symptoms may have increased iron stores. Other associated conditions include varicose vein or venous reflux, folate deficiency, magnesium deficiency, fibromyalgia, sleep apnea, uremia, diabetes, thyroid disease, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson's disease and [[Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome|POTS]] and certain [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[celiac disease]], and [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. RLS can also worsen in pregnancy.<ref name="pmid19592302">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2009.04.005 |title=Pregnancy accounts for most of the gender difference in prevalence of familial RLS |year=2010 |last1=Pantaleo |first1=Nicholas P. |last2=Hening |first2=Wayne A. |last3=Allen |first3=Richard P. |last4=Earley |first4=Christopher J. |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=310–313 |pmid=19592302 |pmc=2830334}}</ref> In a 2007 study, RLS was detected in 36% of patients attending a [[phlebology]] (vein disease) clinic, compared to 18% in a control group.<ref name="phlebology">{{cite journal |pages=156–63 |doi=10.1258/026835507781477145 |title=Restless legs syndrome in patients with chronic venous disorders: an untold story |year=2007 |last1=McDonagh |first1=B |last2=King |first2=T |last3=Guptan |first3=R C |journal=Phlebology |volume=22 |issue=4 |pmid=18265529}}</ref>  ===ADHD=== An association has been observed between [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and RLS or [[periodic limb movement disorder]].

There are no specific tests for RLS, but non-specific laboratory tests are used to rule out other causes such as vitamin deficiencies.

Many patients find relief when moving and the relief continues while they are moving.  In more severe RLS this relief of symptoms may not be complete or the symptoms may reappear when the movement ceases. # Worsening at rest.  Patients may describe being the most affected when sitting for a long period of time, such as when traveling in a car or airplane, attending a meeting, or watching a performance.  An increased level of mental awareness may help reduce these symptoms. # Worsening in the evening or night.<ref name=pmid14592341/>  Patients with mild or moderate RLS show a clear [[circadian rhythm]] to their symptoms, with an increase in sensory symptoms and restlessness in the evening and into the night.  == Prevention == Other than preventing the underlying causes, generally no method of preventing RLS has been established or studied. If RLS is due to specific treatable causes (specific medications or treatable conditions), then treatment of those causes may also remove or reduce RLS. Otherwise medical responses focus on treating the condition, either [[Symptomatic treatment|symptomatically]] or by targeting lifestyle changes and bodily processes capable of modifying its expression or severity.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  ==Treatment== Treatment of restless legs syndrome involves identifying the cause of symptoms when possible.  The treatment process is designed to reduce symptoms, including decreasing the number of nights with RLS symptoms, the severity of RLS symptoms and nighttime awakenings.  Improving the quality of life is another goal in treatment.  This means improving overall quality of life, decreasing daytime [[somnolence|sleepiness]], and improving the quality of sleep.

However, at least 40% of people will not notice any improvement. It is not advised to take oral iron supplements without first having ferritin levels tested, as many people with RLS do not have low ferritin and taking iron when it is not called for is unlikely to offer any therapeutic benefit whilst still able to cause adverse events.

"Motor restlessness, expressed as activity, which relieves the urge to move." "Worsening of symptoms by relaxation." "Variability over the course of the day-night cycle, with symptoms worse in the evening and early in the night." "Restless legs feel similar to the urge to yawn, situated in the legs or arms." Primary RLS is considered idiopathic or with no known cause. Primary RLS usually begins slowly, before approximately 40–45 years of age and may disappear for months or even years. It is often progressive and gets worse with age. RLS in children is often misdiagnosed as growing pains. Secondary RLS often has a sudden onset after age 40, and may be daily from the beginning. It is most associated with specific medical conditions or the use of certain drugs (see below).
