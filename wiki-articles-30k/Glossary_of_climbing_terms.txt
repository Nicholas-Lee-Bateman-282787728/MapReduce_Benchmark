 This page describes terms and jargon related to climbing and mountaineering.     A type of abseiling point used especially in winter and ice climbing. Also known as V-thread. The area of a glacier where yearly melting meets or exceeds the annual snow fall. The process by which a climber can descend a fixed rope. Also known as Rappel. An anchor method similar to a cordelette but that is dynamically equalizing. It employs a cord and a rappel ring. A thin blade mounted perpendicular to the handle on an ice axe that can be used for chopping footholds. A style of climbing in which standing on or pulling oneself up via devices attached to fixed or placed protection is used to make upward progress. Generally climbing in the mountains. Probably includes a mixture of ice climbing and dry-tooling. Alpine style generally means carrying all gear in a backpack even for multi day climbs. To use your knee as a way to gain ground on a climb. To make an efficient start on a long climb by packing all your gear the previous evening and starting early in the morning, usually well before sunrise. A medical condition that is often observed at high altitudes. Also known as Acute mountain sickness, or AMS. An anchor which is created by connecting a closed loop of cord or webbing between two points of protection, and then suspending the rope from a carabiner clipped to only one strand of said anchor.  This creates a triangular shape in the webbing or cord, which places massively multiplied inward forces on the protection, making it a dangerous, ineffective anchor. An arrangement of one or (usually) more pieces of gear set up to support the weight of a belay or top rope. The path or route to the start of a technical climb. Although this is generally a walk or, at most, a scramble it is occasionally as hazardous as the climb itself. Jamming an arm into a crack and locking it into place. (from the French word meaning arched) Used to describe crimping. In this position typically the first set of knuckles are hyperextended and the second have a sharp angle of about 90 degrees. This combines muscular effort with soft tissue tensions in order to apply the load. When used often, this position has been known to over-stress the tendons in fingers and lead to injuries. To climb a rope using aid device. A device for ascending on a rope. The direction in which a slope faces.Aspect (geography) A proprietary belay device manufactured by Black Diamond. Has become common term for any tubular belay devices. ATC originally stood for 'Air Traffic Controller'. A fast method for setting up a two-point anchor in sport climbing, using the climbing rope to attach to the anchor points. When a climber falls in a manner where the rope that they are attached to runs through their legs; upon falling, the rope tightens and suspends the climber via the rope rather than the harness. A grading system for bouldering problems, invented by John Gill. Now largely superseded by the "V" grading system. A piece of training equipment used to improve campusing and core strength. A potentially hazardous mistake that can be made while lead climbing. The rope is clipped into a quickdraw such that the leader's end runs underneath the quickdraw as opposed to over top of it.  If the leader falls, the rope may fold directly over the gate causing it to open and release the rope from the carabiner. To retreat from a climb. If a climber has only two points of contact using either the right or left side of their body, the other half may swing uncontrollably out from the wall like a door on a hinge. A copperhead intended for pounding into a crack To protect a roped climber from falling by passing the rope through, or around, any type of friction enhancing belay device.  Before belay devices were invented, the rope was simply passed around the belayer's hips to create friction. A mechanical device used to create friction when belaying by putting bends in the rope. Many types of belay devices exist, including ATC, grigri, Reverso, Sticht plate, eight and tuber. Some belay devices may also be used as descenders. A Munter hitch can sometimes be used instead of a belay device. The strongest point on the harness.  This is the loop you use your belay device on.

The clean ascent of a climb on the first attempt, having previously obtained beta or while having beta shouted up from the ground en route.  Also see on-sight. A technique used to keep the feet on when climbing on overhangs. One foot is placed on a foothold and the other foot is placed behind the foothold in a toe hook position. The climber can now squeeze the hold between the feet. (French "two fingers") A climbing hold, typically a pocket or hueco, that has enough room for two fingers. See also mono. A climb on which most parties will spend more than one day. Big wall style generally refers to hauling the needed gear (food, water, sleeping bags) in a haulbag. Instead of carrying the gear on their person, the climbers put it in the haul bag and raise it in between pitches. See Carabiner. From the French "bivouac".  A camp, or the act of camping, overnight while still on a climbing route off the ground.  May involve nothing more than lying down or sitting on a rock ledge without any sleeping gear.  When there is no rock ledge available, such as on a sheer vertical wall, a portaledge that hangs from anchors on the wall can be used.

To reduce pains from heavy-duty climbing using a harness; such as long-time belaying or bolting a new route, climbers attach their harness with a special type of chair, which is usually light and has multiple high endurance straps and buckles. Similar types are also used in industrial climbing. The practice of climbing on large boulders. Typically this is close to the ground, so protection takes the form of crash pads and spotting instead of belay ropes. see Stemming A large handhold. A slang word, referring to a difficult or uncomfortable hold, often one that tears the skin on the hand.

Well known practitioners of this lifestyle include Jan and Herb Conn or Fred Beckey. The term denotes the use of two separate ropes, which is true of alpine and rock climbers, but not as much for tree climbers, who usually see it as synonymous with Doubled Rope Technique.

Can often be remedied by bringing the heel of the offending leg down, changing the muscles used to support the weight of the climber The end of the belay rope that is attached to the lead climber.  "Being on the sharp end" refers to the act of lead climbing, which is considered more psychologically demanding than top-roping or following, since it may involve more route-finding, as well as the possibility of longer, more consequential falls. A Sherpa is a person of the ethnic group of the same name that is located in the Himalayan Mountains. Also a generic term for mountaineering porters in Nepal (usually those working at or above base camp) regardless of their ethnic group A traditionally-belayed lead climber reaches a new belay station, creates an anchor, tying the lead rope off to the anchor.  The climber then switches over to self-belaying and continues to climb. Meanwhile, the second climber ascends the fixed rope using ascenders (aka Jugging) and cleans the pitch. When the second reaches the belay, he or she anchors in and starts to belay the leader in the traditional way again. When the leader reaches the next belay the process is repeated. A hold that needs to be gripped with a sideways pull towards the body. A technique where both climbers move simultaneously upward with the leader placing protection which the second removes as they advance. A device known as a Tibloc which allows the rope to only move in a single direction is sometimes used to prevent the second climber from accidentally pulling the lead climber off should the second slip. The use of a single rope where one or both ends of the rope are attached to fixed anchor points. A method of starting a rappel from a cliff edge, accomplished by sitting with legs over the edge and then spinning around to face the cliff while planting feet on the face. Starting a climb from a position in which the climber is sitting on the floor. This is common in climbing gyms in order to fit an extra move into the climb. Noted as SS or SDS in some topo guides. Climbing without following any specific color in a gym with color-designated routes/problems. Also referred to as "climbing the rainbow," since any and all colors of holds are used. A small hook which gives hold on small protrusions or watery and slippery grips. They are most often used for placements, often extremely marginal, in aid climbing, although they also feature in some extreme free routes. Additionally, the skyhook can be attached to the harness, thus allowing the climber to rest, or held in one or both hands to hold a grip. A relatively low-angle (significantly less than vertical) section of rock, usually with few large features. Requires slab climbing techniques. A particular type of rock climbing, and its associated techniques, involved in climbing rock that is less than vertical. The emphasis is on balance, footwork, and making use of very small features or rough spots on the rock for friction. Portion of rope that is not taut, preferably minimized during belay. Abbreviation for spring-loaded camming device, a type of protection device. These are better known by the term cam. Webbing sewn, or tied, into a loop. Poor footwork [Northumberland climbing slang] as in "Nae Sloppy Ploppin'" - "you'll need accurate footwork to have any chance of flashing this". A sloping hold with very little positive surface. A sloper is comparable to palming a basketball. To use friction on the sole of the climbing shoe, in the absence of any useful footholds. A type of tubular ice screw that is inserted by hammering. An angled aluminium plate attached to a metal cable. The fluke is buried into snow, typically used as a deadman anchor. Setting and cleaning ones own protection on an ascent; climbing by oneself. A hold that is wet and slimy from water or some other source. In indoor climbing, a hold that is not secure and spins in place when weight is applied. See horn. A style of climbing where form, technical (or gymnastic) ability and strength are more emphasized over exploration, self-reliance and the exhilaration of the inherent dangers involved in the sport. Sport climbing routes tend to be well protected with pre-placed bolt-anchors and lends itself well to competitive climbing. A method of protection commonly used during bouldering or before the leader has placed a piece of protection. The spotter stands beneath the climber, ready to absorb the energy of a fall and direct him away from any hazards. A type of hand position where the fingers and thumb are opposed. Giving unwanted&nbsp;â and unasked-for - beta to a fellow climber.  Also, excessive, overly prominent, or boorish proclamation of one's own (often exaggerated) skills or exploits. Of a style of climbing or specific move, not dynamic.  In general this entails movement of a limb to a new hold without the simultaneous transfer of weight. Instead weight transfer occurs after the limb has moved. A non-elastic rope. Compare with dynamic rope. Descriptive of any climbing face that is angled beyond vertical. See Overhang. Scooping steps out of snow or ice with the adze of an ice axe. Scooping and stamping steps out of soft snow with the feet. A belay device consisting of a flat plate with a pair of slots. Named after the inventor Fritz Sticht. A long stick on the end of which a climber can affix a quickdraw. It allows the climber to clip a quickdraw to the first bolt on a sport climb while still standing on the ground. This is especially useful if the first bolt is high up, and out of the comfort zone of the climber. A stick clip can be bought or easily made by attaching a quickdraw to a stick with a rubber band. A kind of proto- climbing harness consisting of a long length of tubular webbing wrapped several times around the climbers body and secured with a water knot.  Largely eschewed today in favor of commercial harnesses. Refers to the last member or the tail of a climbing group. The sweeper's task is to spot and retrieve things that may have accidentally fallen from the preceding climbers; to make sure that no mess or gear is left behind; and to make sure that the rear is keeping up with the whole team. The term sweeper, a Filipino contribution to mountaineering vocabulary was introduced in 1998 and was inspired by The Cleaner character in the 1990 film Nikita, also known as La Femme Nikita by Luc Besson. A dynamic form of the lieback described above, rotating off one foot while maintaining a grip with that hand, then grabbing a high handhold at the deadpoint of the swing. This move is frequently reversible, unlike more aerial dynos. Called by a climber when requesting that the belayer remove all slack. See hang dogging. An area of large rock fragments on a mountainside that may vary from house-size to as small as a small backpack. The area, if older and consolidated, may be stable, or the rocks may be precariously balanced.  Talus is distinguished from scree in that it is larger and may feature solid interlocking of the rocks, while scree is by definition loose. When, after a whipper, or long fall, a climber falls past their belayer, who is generally lifted up off the ground. Climbing involving a rope and some means of protection, as opposed to scrambling or glacier travel. A term often used as synonymous with requiring precision and control, as in a very technical sequence of move. Difficulty ratings of climbs often is a combination of technicality of a climb and the endurance or strength necessary to complete it. Specialized moves given names to help communicate what to do to another person. From the French word meaning outstretched. In this grip the fingers are close to the position when the hand is open.  The relative angle between the finger bones is gradual. The load applied is coming from tension in the forearm muscles. A technique for maintaining balance using a taut rope through a point of protection. A climb that is representative of the hardest, best climbs in an area. Make progress by squeezing into a space and wriggling against opposing rock surfaces. The leg straps and waist belt create two loops connecting the belay loop.  The points which you tie in at.  Also known as soft loops. A toe hook is securing the upper side of the toes on a hold.  It helps pull the body inwardsâtowards the wall.  The toe hook is often used on overhanging rock where it helps to keep the body from swinging away from the wall. To belay from a fixed anchor point above the climb. Top-roping requires easy access to the top of the climb, by means of a footpath or scrambling. To complete a route by ascending over the top of the structure being climbed. To use holds specified out for you in any route, usually used in gym climbing. A style of climbing that emphasizes the adventure and exploratory nature of climbing. While sport climbers generally will use pre-placed protection ("bolts"), traditional (or "trad") climbers will place their own protection as they climb, generally carried with them on a rack. Getting prepared to climb on difficult mountains. A technique that is typically used while lowering and cleaning gear from an overhanging and/or traversing route.  A quickdraw is clipped between the climber's harness and the rope that is threaded through the gear.  As the climber is lowered by the belayer, the quickdraw holds the cleaner close to the wall and following the line of the route.  Without the quickdraw, the climber would lower straight down, further and further from the remaining gear to be cleaned. Also known as trolleying. A simple camming protection device that has no moving parts. A belay device. A limestone rib formation that protrudes from the wall which can sometimes fit within the pinching grasp of a climber's hand; alternatively: a plastic, bolted on bouldering hold designed to replicate such a formation on an indoor climbing wall. A hold which is gripped with the palm of the hand facing upwards A technical grading system for bouldering problems, invented by John Sherman. A type of abseiling point used especially in winter and ice climbing. Also called abalakov thread. A thin coating of ice that forms over rocks when rainfall or melting snow freezes on rock. Hard to climb on as there is insufficient depth for crampons to have reliable penetration. See also clear ice and glaze ice. A large, hollow bolted-on bouldering hold. Originating in Sheffield, a WAD is a "super climber" or climber who is on-sighting 7c+. A bamboo stick with a small flag on top used to mark paths over glaciers and snow fields. A graceful female climber who appears to dance up the climbing wall. Hollow and flat nylon strip, mainly used to make slings. A piece of webbing with eyes sewn into the ends which can be used in place of a cordelette. As in, "weighting the rope." Any time the rope takes the weight of the climber. This can happen during a minor fall, a whipper (long fall), or simply by resting while hanging on the belay rope (see also hangdogging). A lead fall from above and to the side of the last clip, whipping oneself downwards and in an arc. Has come to denote any fall beyond the last placed or clipped piece of protection. A route or sequence that a climber has rehearsed extensively and thus ascends with ease. See dialled. See nuts. To complete a lead climb during night time. A home made climbing wall. Often specifically a hybrid between a climbing wall and a fingerboard. Specifically called such because of the wooden panels (usually left unpainted) used to attach the climbing holds to. A rating from the Yosemite Decimal System given to climbs that have very poor or no protection. These climbs often present risk of serious injury or death if a fall were to occur, even if the climb is properly protected. A hold appearing to be composed of a different type of rock than the surrounding face. Another name for a Sit start, a 'Yabo start' was named after John 'Yabo' Yablonski. To pull on the rope to make upward progress, often with assistance from the belayer. This may be done to bypass a crux, or to quickly regain ground lost after a fall without re-climbing the section. AKA to "jug up" the rope. A numerical system for rating the difficulty of walks, hikes, and climbs in the United States. The rock climbing (5.x) portion of the scale is the most common climb grading system used in the US. The scale starts with the easiest grades at 5.0 and is open-ended on the harder end. , the most difficult grade was 5.15c. Clipping into an anchor with the segment of rope from beneath the previous piece of protection, resulting in a potentially dangerous tangled configuration of the belay rope. A fall in which each piece of protection fails in turn.  In some cases when the rope comes taut during a fall, the protection can fail from the bottom up, especially if the first piece was not placed to account for outward and/or upward force. Also Z-system. A particular configuration of rope, anchors, and pulleys typically used to extricate a climber after falling into a crevasse. A small ridge-like feature or a sharp outward facing corner on a steep rock face ArÃªte, a narrow ridge of rock formed by glacial erosion A method of indoor climbing, in which one is able to use such a corner as a hold. See also dihedral. A rock cleft with vertical sides mostly parallel, large enough to fit the climber's body into. To climb such a structure, the climber often uses his head, back and feet to apply opposite pressure on the vertical walls. The process of using such a technique (chimneying). A mechanical device, or a wedge, used as anchors in cracks. A naturally occurring stone wedged in a crack. To remove equipment from a route. A route that is free of loose vegetation and rocks. To complete a climb without falling or resting on the rope. Also see redpoint. In aid climbing, abbreviated "C", a route that does not require the use of a hammer or any invasive addition of protection (such as pitons or copperheads) into the rock (see protection). Using crampons to ascend or descend on ice, preferably with maximum number of points of the crampon into the ice for weight distribution. Accidentally piercing something with a crampon spike. A hold which is only just big enough to be grasped with the tips of the fingers. The process of holding onto a crimp. The ground. To hit the ground, usually the outcome of a fall. Normal flag: Where the flagging foot stays on the same side (e.g. flagging with the right foot out to the right side of the body) Reverse inside flag: Where the flagging foot is crossed in front of the foot that is on a foothold Reverse outside flag: Where the flagging foot is crossed behind the foot that is on a foothold A thin slab of rock detached from the main face. A method of untangling a rope in which the rope is run through the climber's hands and allowed to fall into a pile on the ground.  Useful when preparing a rope for coiling, or before starting a lead climb, to ensure the rope is fed cleanly and without twists.  Often called "flaking out" a rope. Climbing without unnatural aids, other than used for protection. Often incorrectly used by non-climbers as a synonym for soloing. Intended as an objective measure of the technical difficulty of a particular climb or bouldering problem. More often is highly subjective, however. The slope of an incline. (Grade (geography)) Equipment used in aid climbing. A climbing technique involving hooking a heel or toe against a hold in order to balance or to provide additional support. A type of mechanical ascender. To ascend a rope using a mechanical ascender. Swinging on taut rope to reach the next hold in a pendulum traverse. A swing during a fall when the last piece of protection is far to one side. Process of setting equipment or anchors for safety. Equipment or anchors used for arresting falls. Commonly known as Pro. A knot used for ascending a rope.  It is named after Dr Karl Prusik, the Austrian mountaineer who developed this knot in 1931. To use a Prusik knot for ascending a rope. To have such an accumulation of metabolic waste products in the forearm, that forming even a basic grip becomes impossible.  A climber who is pumped will find it difficult to hold on, and may struggle to lift or clip a rope. (Psychology) A feeling of anticipation and energy before a challenging climb. A lengthy distance between two points of protection which in some, but not all, cases might be perceived as frightening or dangerous.  May also be used as an adjective to describe a route, or a section of a route. A long portion of a route with minimal protection. A long and loud fall. A nylon webbing structure consisting of one large loop sewn in multiple places to make a shorter length. The stitch-points are intentionally sewn with less than maximum possible strength. The screamer is attached with carabiners between an anchor point, particularly one of dubious strength, and the climber. In the event of a fall the stitching of the sewn sections is designed to rip apart, absorbing some of the fall energy and decelerating the climber, thereby reducing the overall shock load on the dubious anchor.  Screamer is a brand name of Yates Mountaineering. The simultaneous use of two widely spaced footholds. Climbing using two faces that are at an angle less than 180Â° to each other. A wedge-shaped nut made by Black Diamond. A knot used to prevent the rope running through a piece of equipment. The high point of a mountain or peak. To reach such a high point. To climb in a horizontal direction. A section of a route that requires progress in a horizontal direction. A Tyrolean traverse is crossing a chasm using a rope anchored at both ends. A pendulum traverse involves swinging across a wall or chasm while suspended from a rope affixed above the climber.
