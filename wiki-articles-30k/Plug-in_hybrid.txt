 A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a hybrid vehicle with batteries that can be recharged by connecting a plug to an electric power source. It shares the characteristics of both conventional hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, having an internal combustion engine and batteries for power. Most PHEVs on the road today are passenger cars, but there are also PHEV versions of commercial passenger vans, utility trucks, school buses, motorcycles, scooters, and military vehicles. PHEVs are sometimes called grid-connected hybrids, gas-optional hybrids, or GO-HEVs. The cost for electricity to power plug-in hybrids for all-electric operation in California has been estimated at less than one quarter of the cost of gasoline.Frank, A., et al., "What are Plug-In Hybrids?" Team Fate (University of California, Davis) Retrieved 7 August 2007; earlier version Compared to conventional vehicles, PHEVs can reduce air pollution and dependence on petroleum, and lessen greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Plug-in hybrids use no fossil fuel during their all-electric range if their batteries are charged from renewable energy sources. Other benefits include improved national energy security, fewer fill-ups at the filling station, the convenience of home recharging, opportunities to provide emergency backup power in the home, and vehicle to grid applications.Simpson, A.

A plug-in hybrid's all-electric range is designated by PHEV-[miles] or PHEV[kilometers]km in which the number represents the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alone. For example, a PHEV-20 can travel twenty miles without using its internal combustion engine, or about 32&nbsp;kilometers, so it may also be designated as a PHEV32km. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 defines plug-in electric drive vehicle as a vehicle that: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defines a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle as any hybrid electric vehicle which contains at least: This distinguishes PHEVs from regular hybrid cars mass-marketed today, which do not use any electricity from the grid.IEEE-USA Board of Directors (15 June 2007) "Plug-In Electric Hybrid Vehicles" Position Statement retrieved 3 October 2007 Hybrid vehicles were produced beginning as early as 1899 by Lohner-Porsche. Early hybrids could be charged from an external source before operation. However, the term "plug-in hybrid" has come to mean a hybrid vehicle that can be charged from a standard electrical wall socket. The July 1969 issue of Popular Science featured an article on the General Motors XP-883 plug-in hybrid.

A battery or capacitor pack, or a combination of the two, can be used to store excess charge. Examples of series hybrids include the Renault Kangoo Elect'Road, Toyota's Japan-only Coaster light-duty passenger bus, DaimlerChrysler's hybrid Orion bus, the Chevrolet Volt concept car, the Opel Flextreme concept car, and many diesel-electric locomotives. With an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ICE. As is the case for other architectures, series hybrids can operate without recharging as long as there is liquid fuel in the tank.Layton, J. and Nice, K. (2007) "How Hybrid Cars Work" HowStuffWorks.com accessed 19 June 2007 Parallel hybrids, such as Honda's Insight, Civic, and Accord hybrids, can simultaneously transmit power to their drive wheels from two distinct sources—for example, an internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric drive. Although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle's engine and transmission, a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle's axles, while its electric motor drives the other axle and/or a generator used for recharging the batteries. (This type is called a road-coupled hybrid). The Audi Duo plug-in hybrid concept car is an example of this type of parallel hybrid architecture. Parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ICE at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ICE, both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ICE vehicle.BC Climate Exchange (2005) "Hybrid Basics" Hybrid Experience Report accessed 19 June 2007 Series-parallel hybrids have the flexibility to operate in either series or parallel mode. Hybrid powertrains currently used by Ford, Lexus, Nissan, and Toyota, which some refer to as “series-parallel with power-split,” can operate in both series and parallel mode at the same time. As of 2007, most plug-in hybrid conversions of conventional hybrids utilize this architecture.Toyota Motor Corporation (2006) "Series Parallel Hybrid System" Hybrid Synergy Drive accessed 19 June 2007 Regardless of its architecture, a plug-in hybrid may be capable of charge-depleting and charge-sustaining modes. Combinations of these two modes are termed blended mode or mixed-mode. These vehicles can be designed to drive for an extended range in all-electric mode, either at low speeds only or at all speeds. These modes manage the vehicle's battery discharge strategy, and their use has a direct effect on the size and type of battery required:Green Car Congress (September 29, 2006) Plug-ins Progress accessed 27 April 2007 Charge-depleting mode allows a fully charged PHEV to operate exclusively (or depending on the vehicle, almost exclusively, except during hard acceleration) on electric power until its battery state of charge is depleted to a predetermined level, at which time the vehicle's internal combustion engine or fuel cell will be engaged. This period is the vehicle's all-electric range. This is the only mode that a battery electric vehicle can operate in, hence their limited range.Gonder, J. and Markel, T. (2007) "Energy Management Strategies for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles" (PDF) technical report NREL/CP-540-40970 presented at SAE World Congress, April 16-19, 2007, Detroit, Michigan Charge-sustaining mode is used by production hybrid vehicles (HEVs) today, and combines the operation of the vehicle's two power sources in such a manner that the vehicle is operating as efficiently as possible without allowing the battery state of charge to move outside a predetermined narrow band. Over the course of a trip in a HEV the state of charge may fluctuate but will have no net change.Tony Markel/NREL: "Plug-in HEV Vehicle Design Options and Expectations" (PDF) accessed 27 April 2007  The battery in a HEV can thus be thought of as an energy accumulator rather than a fuel storage device. Once a plug-in hybrid has exhausted its all-electric range in charge-depleting mode, it can switch into charge-sustaining mode automatically. Blended mode is a type of charge-depleting mode normally employed by vehicles which do not have enough electric power to sustain high speeds without the help of the internal combustion portion of the powertrain. A blended control strategy typically increases the distance from stored grid electricity compared to a charge-depleting strategy.Santini, et al (September 27, 2006) Energy and Petroleum Consumption Attributes of Plug-in Hybrids (PDF), accessed 29 April 2007 The Renault Kangoo and some Toyota Prius conversions are examples of vehicles that use this mode of operation. The Electri'cité and Elect'road versions of the Kangoo were charge-depleting battery electric vehicles: the Elect'road had a modest internal combustion engine which extended its range somewhat. Conversions of 2004 and later model Toyota Prius can only run without using the ICE at speeds of less than about  due to the limits dictated by the vehicle's powertrain control software. However, at faster speeds electric power can still be used to displace gasoline, thus improving the fuel economy in blended mode and generally doubling the fuel efficiency. Mixed mode describes a trip in which a combination of the above modes are utilized.EAA-PHEV wiki: Mixed-mode accessed 29 April 2007  For example, a PHEV-20 Prius conversion may begin a trip with  of low speed charge-depleting, then get onto a freeway and operate in blended mode for , using  worth of all-electric range at twice the fuel economy. Finally the driver might exit the freeway and drive for another  without the internal combustion engine until the full  of all-electric range are exhausted. At this point the vehicle can revert back to a charge sustaining-mode for another  until the final destination is reached. Such a trip would be considered a mixed mode, as multiple modes are employed in one trip. This contrasts with a charge-depleting trip which would be driven within the limits of a PHEV's all-electric range. Conversely, the portion of a trip which extends beyond the all-electric range of a PHEV would be driven primarily in charge-sustaining mode, as used by a conventional hybrid. PHEVs typically require deeper battery charging and discharging cycles than conventional hybrids. Because the number of full cycles influences battery life, this may be less than in traditional HEVs which do not deplete their batteries as fully. However, some authors argue that PHEVs will soon become standard in the automobile industry.Roim, J. and Frank, A.

(September 7, 2006) "Altair Nanotechnologies Details Long Life Features of Its Nano-Titanate Battery" Business Wire press release The cathodes of some early 2007 lithium-ion batteries are made from lithium-cobalt metal oxide. This material is expensive, and cells made with it can release oxygen if overcharged. If the cobalt is replaced with iron phosphates, the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge. The price premium for early 2007 conventional hybrids is about US$5000, some US$3000 of which is for their NiMH battery packs. At early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices, that would mean a break-even point after six to ten years of operation. The conventional hybrid premium could fall to US$2000 in five years, with US$1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries, providing for a three-year payback. The payback period may be longer for plug-in hybrids, because of their larger, more expensive batteries.Voelcker, J. (January 2007) "Lithium Batteries for Hybrid Cars" IEEE Spectrum Nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries can be recycled; Toyota, for example, has a recycling program in place under which dealers are paid a US$200 credit for each battery returned.Toyota Motor Co (2004) "Hybrid Hype? Fact and Fiction Surrounding the New Technology" Toyota.com accessed 8 July 2007 However, plug-in hybrids typically use larger battery packs than comparable conventional hybrids, and thus require more resources. Recently Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has suggested that utilities could purchase used batteries for backup and load levelling purposes. They state that while these used batteries may be no longer usable in vehicles, their residual capacity still has significant value. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) is a kind of cathode material of lithium iron phosphate batteries that is getting attention from the industry. The most important merit of this battery type is safety and high-power. LiFePO4 is one of three major compounds and technology in LFP family. The other two are Nanophosphate,and NanoCocrystallineOlivine.

Ideally, the vehicle's powertrain software would be reprogrammed to make full use of the battery pack's additional energy storage capacity and power output. Many early plug-in hybrid electric vehicle conversions have been based on the 2004 or later model Toyota Prius.California Cars Initiative (2007) "Where Plug-In Hybrid Conversions (mostly Priuses) Are" accessed July 8, 2007. Some of the systems have involved replacement of the vehicle's original NiMH battery pack and its electronic control unit.

The EAA-PHEV project was conceived by CalCars and the Electric Auto Association in October of 2005 to accelerate efforts to document existing HEVs and their potential for conversion into PHEVs.Electric Auto Association "Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle" wiki (2005-present) It includes a "conversion interest" page.Conversion Interest - EAA-PHEV The Electric Auto Association-PHEV "Do-It-Yourself" Open Source community's primary focus is to provide conversion instructions to help guide experienced converters through the process, and to provide a common design that could demonstrate multiple battery technologies. Many members of organizations such as CalCars and the EAA as well as companies like Hybrids Plus, Hybrid Interfaces of Canada, and Manzanita Micro participate in the development of the project. Claimed fuel economy for PHEVs depends on the amount of driving between recharges. If no gasoline is used the MPG equivalent depends only on the efficiency of the electric system. A  () range PHEV-70 may annually require only about 25% as much gasoline as a similarly designed PHEV-0, depending on how it will be driven and the trips for which it will be used. The furthest all-electric range in a PHEV planned for mass production is the PHEV-60 BYD F6e. A further advantage of PHEVs is that they have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the PHEV's internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency. While a Prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30% efficiency (well below the engine's 38% peak efficiency) the engine of a PHEV-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency. The actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation, inversion, battery charging/discharging, the motor controller and motor itself, the way a vehicle is used (its duty cycle), and the opportunities to recharge by connecting to the electrical grid. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) developed their recommended practice in 1999 for testing and reporting the fuel economy of hybrid vehicles and included language to address PHEVs. An SAE committee is currently working to review procedures for testing and reporting the fuel economy of PHEVs.U.S. Dept. of Energy (18 September 2007) "Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Conversions" Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center retrieved 8 November 2007 Another advantage of PHEV adoption is a predicted reduction in carbon emissions. Increased drivetrain efficiency results in significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, even taking into account energy lost to inefficiency in the production and distribution of grid power and charging of batteries. A study by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE)  predicts that, on average, a typical American driver is expected to achieve about a 15% reduction in net CO2 emissions compared to the driver of a regular hybrid, based on the 2005 distribution of power sources feeding the U.S. electrical grid. Additionally, for PHEVs recharged in areas where the grid is fed by power sources with lower CO2 emissions than the current average, net CO2 emissions associated with PHEVs will decrease correspondingly. A large-scale June 2007 joint study by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) similarly found that the introduction of PHEVs into America’s consumer vehicle fleet could achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions.Knipping, E. and Duvall, M. (June 2007) "Environmental Assessment of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Volume 1: Nationwide Greenhouse Gas Emissions" Electric Power Research Institute and Natural Resources Defense Council accessed July 21, 2007 The EPRI-NRDC report estimates that, between 2010 and 2050, a shift toward PHEV use could reduce GHG emissions by 3.4 to 10.4 billion metric tons. The magnitude of these reductions would ultimately depend on the level of PHEV market penetration and the carbon intensity of the US electricity sector. In general, PHEVs can be viewed as an element in the "Pacala and Socolow wedges" approach which shows a way to stabilize CO2 emissions using a portfolio of existing techniques, including efficient vehicles. The ACEEE study predicts that in areas where more than 80% of grid-power comes from coal-burning power plants, local net CO2 emissions will increase.Kliesch, J. and Langer, T. (September 2006) "Plug-In Hybrids: an Environmental and Economic Performance Outlook" American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy  However, given the global nature of problems associated with CO2 emissions, specifically global warming, localized increases in CO2 emissions are not considered a significant problem if global CO2 emissions are decreased. GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz has said the Chevy Volt will emit 40&nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer. That is well below the proposed European Union emission standards of 120-130&nbsp;g/km.Green Car Congress (10 September 2007) "GM Unveils Opel Flextreme: Plug-in Diesel Hybrid Variant of E-Flex" retrieved 1 October 2007 In a 2006 research estimate in California, the cost to plug in at night was equivalent to US$0.75 per U.S. gallon (3.8 L) of gasoline, whereas the pre-tax cost of gasoline is just under US$3 per gallon. The cost of electricity for a Prius PHEV is about US$0.03 per mile (US$0.019 per km), based on  and a cost of electricity of US$0.10 per kilowatt hour.California Cars Initiative (April 20, 2006) "Fact Sheet: PHEV Conversions" (PDF) page 2, accessed 18 April 2006Bluejay, M.

This assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods (i.e., at night), or equipped with technology to shut off charging during periods of peak demand. Another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads. This is accomplished with vehicle to grid technology. By using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power, such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities as well as their owners. Even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of night time electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the day time, and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure.James, W. (September 2006) "Large Oil and GHG Reductions with Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles" Alternative Transport Energies Conference (Perth, Australia) In October 2005, five Toyota engineers and one Asian AW engineer published an IEEE technical paper detailing a Toyota-approved project to add vehicle-to-grid capability to a Toyota Prius.Oyobe, H. et al.

However, the vehicle was featured in a Toyota Dream House, and a brochure for the exhibit stated that "the house can supply electricity to the battery packs of the vehicles via the stand in the middle of the garage", indicating that the vehicle may have been a plug-in hybrid.Green Car Congress (26 September 2005) "Toyota Dream House with Plug-In Prius" accessed 23 April 2007 In November 2005, more than 50 leaders from public power utility companies across the United States met at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power headquarters to discuss plug-in hybrid and vehicle-to-grid technology. The event, which was sponsored by the American Public Power Association, also provided an opportunity for association members to plan strategies that public power utility companies could use to promote plug-in hybrid technology. Greg Hanssen and Peter Nortman of EnergyCS EnergyCS (USA) and Amberjac (UK) and EDriveEDrive™ Installation attended the two-day session, and during a break in the proceedings, made an impromptu display in the LADWP parking lot of their converted Prius plug-in hybrid.Green Car Congress (18 November 2005) "Plugging the Plug-In Hybrid" accessed 20 April 2007 In September 2006, the California Air Resources Board held a Zero Emission Vehicle symposium that included several presentations on V2G technology.Green Car Congress (September 27, 2006) The Plug-In and BEV Adoption Wild Card: Vehicle-to-Grid accessed April 28, 2007 In April 2007, Pacific Gas and Electric showcased a PHEV at the Silicon Valley Leadership Alternative Energy Solutions Summit with vehicle-to-grid capability, and demonstrated that it could be used as a source of emergency home power in the event of an electrical power failure.Green Car Congress (April 9, 2007) "PG&E Demonstrates Vehicle-to-Grid Technology" accessed April 20, 2007 Regulations intended to protect electricians against power other than from grid sources would need to be changed, or regulations requiring consumers to disconnect from the grid when connected to non-grid sources will be required before such backup power solutions would be feasible.News.com (April 9, 2007) "PG&E sees plug-in hybrids as potential profit centers" Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner Jon Wellinghoff coined the term "Cash-Back Hybrids" to describe payments to car owners for putting their batteries on the power grid. Batteries could also be offered in low-cost leasing or renting  or by donation (including maintenance) to the car owners by the public utilities, in a vehicle-to-grid agreement.Liotsakis, P. (2007) "Cars, Power Plants and 'Cash Back Hybrids'" LiveNeutral (Presidio School of Management and Chicago Climate Exchange) accessed 12 July 2007. Disadvantages of plug-in hybrids include the additional cost, weight, and size of a larger battery pack. General Motors may allow buyers of its Chevy Volt electric car to rent the vehicle's battery, offsetting some cost.Simon, B.

Many people living in apartments, condominiums, and townhouses do not have garages. With only on-street parking available, they will need access to electrical outlets to take advantage of all-electric operation.  New electrical outlets near their places of residence, or in commercial or public parking lots will need to be installed for them to gain the full advantage of PHEVs.San Francisco Department of the Environment (September 4, 2007) "Response to the Findings and Recommendations of the 2006-2007 Civil Grand Jury in Their Report: 'Can San Francisco Keep Its Promise to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions'" (Recommendation B7c) accessed 30 October 2007 Increased pollution is expected to occur in some areas with the adoption of PHEVs, but most areas will experience a decrease.Knipping, E. and Duvall, M. (June 2007) "Environmental Assessment of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Volume 2: United States Air Quality Analysis Based on AEO-2006 Assumptions for 2030" Electric Power Research Institute and Natural Resources Defense Council accessed July 21, 2007 A study by the ACEEE predicts that widespread PHEV use in heavily coal-dependent areas would result in an increase in local net sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, given emissions levels from most coal plants currently supplying power to the grid.Clayton, M. (September 25, 2006) "A reality check on plug-in hybrids" The Christian Science Monitor Although clean coal technologies could create power plants which supply grid power from coal without emitting significant amounts of such pollutants, the higher cost of the application of these technologies may increase the price of coal-generated electricity. The net effect on pollution is dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid (fossil or renewable, for example) and the pollution profile of the power plants themselves. Identifying, regulating and upgrading single point pollution source such as a power plant—or replacing a plant altogether—may also be more practical. From a human health perspective, shifting pollution away from large urban areas may be considered a significant advantage.Kanellos, M. (April 28, 2006) "Plug in your hybrid, pollute less?" cNet News.com Martin Eberhard, who co-founded Tesla Motors, says "if you do the math, you´ll find that an electric car, even if you use coal to make electricity, produces less pollution per mile than burning gasoline in the best gasoline-powered car."CBS News (September 16, 2007) "Could The Electric Car Save Us?"

Interest in plug-in hybrids increased in 2006 to such a level that the architecture was included as an area of research in President George W. Bush's advanced energy initiative and mentioned in his 2007 State of the Union Address. Incentives for the development of PHEVs are included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.Evarts, E. (January 11, 2008) "Charge! Fuel economy law promotes plug-in hybrids," Consumer Reports Cars Blog accessed January 15 2008 At least fourteen car companies of all sizes are exploring or planing to offer a plug-in.CalCars (2008) "How Carmakers are Responding to the Plug-In Hybrid Opportunity" calcars.org accessed January 22, 2008 After hearing an explanation of PHEVs, 49% of U.S. consumers surveyed in 2006 said they would consider purchasing one. That is about the same level of interest as standard hybrid technology.Synovate (August 16, 2006) "Survey shows 49% of consumers would consider buying a plug-in hybrid" accessed July 8, 2007. As of February, 2008, all three of the major U.S. presidential candidates have taken a position on plug-in hybrids: In 1994, General Motors acquired a controlling interest in Ovonics's battery development and manufacturing, including patents controlling the manufacturing of large nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries. In 2001, Texaco purchased GM's share in GM Ovonics. A few months later, Chevron acquired Texaco. In 2003, Texaco Ovonics Battery Systems was restructured into Cobasys, a 50/50 joint venture between Chevron and Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) Ovonics.Roberson, J. (March 14, 2007) "Supplier Cobasys exploring more hybrid batteries" Detroit Free Press Chevron's influence over Cobasys extends beyond a strict 50/50 joint venture.  Chevron holds a 19.99% interest in ECD Ovonics.ECD Ovonics Definitive Proxy Statement of January 15, 2003 Chevron also maintains veto power over any sale or licensing of NiMH technology.ECD Ovonics Amended General Statement of Beneficial Ownership of December 2, 2004  In addition, Chevron maintains the right to seize all of Cobasys' intellectual property rights in the event that ECD Ovonics does not fulfill its contractual obligations. On September 10, 2007, Chevron filed a legal claim that ECD Ovonics has not fulfilled its obligations. ECD Ovonics disputes this claim.ECD Ovonics 10-Q Quarterly Report for the period ending September 30, 2007 In her book, Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America, published in February 2007, Sherry Boschert argues that large-format NiMH batteries are commercially viable but that Cobasys refuses to sell or license them to small companies or individuals. Boschert reveals that Cobasys accepts only very large orders for these batteries. When Boschert conducted her research, major auto makers showed little interest in large orders for large-format NiMH batteries. However, Toyota employees complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format NiMH batteries to service the existing 825 RAV-4EVs.  Since no other companies were willing to make large orders, Cobasys was not manufacturing nor licensing any large format NiMH battery technology for automotive purposes.  Boschert concludes that "it's possible that Cobasys (Chevron) is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline. Or it's possible that Cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles." Boschert, S. (2007) Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America (Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers) ISBN 9780865715714 However, recently-signed Cobasys contracts demonstrate that the company is willing to use its NiMH technology in the automotive industry, specifically for use with hybrid electric vehicles.  In December 2006, Cobasys and General Motors announced that they had signed a contract under which Cobasys provides NiMH batteries for the Saturn Aura hybrid sedan.Abuelsamid, S. (December 6,2006) "Cobasys providing NiMH batteries for Saturn Aura hybrid" Autobloggreen.com In March 2007, GM announced that it would use Cobasys NiMH batteries in the 2008 Chevrolet Malibu hybrid as well.  Cobasys remains unwilling to sell NiMH batteries in smaller quantities to individuals or companies interested in building or retrofitting their own PHEVs. Electro Energy Inc., working with CalCars, converted a Prius using a its own bipolar NiMH batteries. Plug-In Conversions uses Nilar NiMH batteries and the EAA-PHEV open source control system in its Prius PHEV conversions.  These organizations maintain that these developments are allowable because their NiMH battery technologies are not covered by Cobasys' patents.   draws motive power from a battery with a capacity  of at least 4 kilowatt-hours; can be recharged from an external source of electricity for motive power; and is a light-, medium-, or heavy-duty motor vehicle or nonroad vehicle. a battery storage system of 4 kW·h or more, used to power the motion of the vehicle; a means of recharging that battery system from an external source of electricity; and an ability to drive at least ten miles (16&nbsp;km) in all-electric mode, while consuming no fuel (gasoline or diesel). Senator Barack Obama delivered a speech on February 28, 2006 calling for every government car to be a PHEV.Remarks of Senator Barack Obama, Governor's Ethanol Coalition, Washington, DC On April 19, 2007, Obama joined with senators Maria Cantwell and Republican Orrin Hatch to introduce legislation providing: tax credits to consumers who purchase plug-ins, patterned after existing incentives for conventional hybrids; tax incentives for the U.S. production of PHEVs and dedicated parts; and incentives for electric utilities to provide rebates to customers who purchase plug-ins, scaled to provide larger incentives to utilities producing greener energy.Cantwell, Hatch, Obama Announce Plan to Promote Plug-In Hybrid Vehicles Senator John McCain pledged on April 23, 2007 to promote partnerships between utilities and automakers to accelerate the deployment of plug-in hybrids.John McCain's Speech On Energy Policy Senator Hillary Clinton called on February 11, 2008 for investment in research and to stimulate demand for the first commercial PHEVs by investing $2 billion in research and development to reduce the cost and increase the longevity and durability of batteries; offering consumers tax credits of up to $10,000 for purchasing a plug-in hybrid; and adding 100,000 plug-in hybrids to the federal fleet by 2015.Hillary Clinton Press Release: Hillary’s Plan to Create a Green Jobs Revolution Alternative propulsion Automotive design terminology Cleanova (a Kangoo derivative) Efficient energy use Electric transportation technology FreedomCAR Low-energy vehicle Mitigation of global warming Net metering Plug In America PHEV Center Electric Automobile Association's Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Wiki - conversion and technical documentation Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles - U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy DoE Grant for Plug In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) Technology Acceleration And Deployment Activity.
