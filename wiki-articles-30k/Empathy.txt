     Empathy is the capacity to understand or feel what another being (a human or non-human animal) is experiencing from within the other being's frame of reference, i.e., the capacity to place oneself in another's position. The English word is derived from the Ancient Greek word ἐμπάθεια (empatheia), "physical affection, passion, partiality" which comes from ἐν (en), "in, at" and πάθος (pathos), "passion" or "suffering".Empatheia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus The term was adapted by Hermann Lotze and Robert Vischer to create the German word Einfühlung ("feeling into"), which was translated by Edward B. Titchener into the English term empathy.Titchener E.B. (1909/2014) Introspection and empathy Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences  2014; 7: 25-30 Alexithymia (the word comes from the Ancient Greek words αλέξω ("alexo" verb meaning remove, repel in order to protect) and θυμός (thymos, "soul, as the seat of emotion, feeling, and thought") modified by an alpha-privative, literally meaning "repelling emotions"), is a term to describe a state of deficiency in understanding, processing, or describing emotions in oneself.Bar-On, Reuven; Parker, James DA (2000). The Handbook of Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Development, Assessment, and Application at Home, School, and in the Workplace. San Francisco, California: Jossey-Bass. ISBN 0-7879-4984-1. Empathy has many different definitions that encompass a broad range of emotional states, including caring for other people and having a desire to help them; experiencing emotions that match another person's emotions; discerning what another person is thinking or feeling; and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other.Hodges, S.D., & Klein, K.J. (2001). Regulating the costs of empathy: the price of being human. Journal of Socio-Economics. It also is the ability to feel and share another person’s emotions. Some believe that empathy involves the ability to match another’s emotions, while others believe that empathy involves being tenderhearted toward another person.Snyder, C. R., Shane J. Lopez, and Jennifer T. Pedrotti. Positive Psychology: The Scientific and Practical Explorations of Human Strengths. Second ed. Los Angeles: SAGE, 2011. 267-75. Print. Compassion and sympathy are two terms that many associate with empathy, but all three of these terms are unique. Compassion is an emotion we feel when others are in need, which motivates us to help them. Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. It can also be understood as having the separateness of defining oneself and another blur. In the field of positive psychology, empathy has also been compared with altruism and egotism. Altruism is behavior that is aimed at benefitting another person, while egotism is a behavior that is acted out for personal gain. Sometimes, when someone is feeling empathetic towards another, acts of altruism occur. However, many question whether or not these acts of altruism are motivated by egotistical gains. According to positive psychologists, people can be adequately moved by their empathies to be altruistic.  Since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people, the way it is characterized is derivative of the way emotions themselves are characterized. If, for example, emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings, then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions is probably innateHappiness Genes: Unlock the Positive Potential Hidden in Your DNA, New Page Books (April, 2010) ISBN 978-1-60163-105-3 and may be achieved unconsciously. Yet it can be trained and achieved with various degrees of intensity or accuracy. Empathy necessarily has a "more or less" quality. The paradigm case of an empathic interaction, however, involves a person communicating an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that the recognized person can tolerate. Recognitions that are both accurate and tolerable are central features of empathy. The human capacity to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one's imitative capacities and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the proprioceptive feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself. Humans seem to make the same immediate connection between the tone of voice and other vocal expressions and inner feeling. Empathy is distinct from sympathy, pity, and emotional contagion.Batson, C.D. (2009). These things called empathy: Eight related but distinct phenomena. In J. Decety and W. Ickes (Eds.), The Social Neuroscience of Empathy (pp.&nbsp;3–15). Cambridge: MIT Press Sympathy or empathic concern is the feeling of compassion or concern for another, the wish to see them better off or happier. Pity is feeling that another is in trouble and in need of help as they cannot fix their problems themselves, often described as "feeling sorry" for someone. Emotional contagion is when a person (especially an infant or a member of a mob) imitatively "catches" the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening. The literature commonly indicates that females are more empathic than males. On average, female subjects score higher than males on the Empathy Quotient (EQ), while males tend to score higher on the Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Both males and females with autistic spectrum disorders usually score higher on the SQ (see below for more detail on autism and empathy). However, a series of studies, using a variety of neurophysiological measures, including MEG, spinal reflex excitability, electroencephalography and N400 paradigm have documented the presence of a gender difference in the human mirror neuron system, with female participants exhibiting stronger motor resonance than male participants. In addition, these aforementioned studies found that female participants scored higher on empathy self-report dispositional measures and that these measures positively correlated with the physiological response. Other studies show no significant difference, and suggests gender differences are the result of motivational differences.Ickes, W. (1997). Empathic accuracy. New York: The Guilford Press. A review published in the journal Neuropsychologia found that women are better at recognizing facial effects, expression processing and emotions in general. Men were only better at recognizing specific behaviour which includes anger, aggression and threatening cues. A 2006 meta-analysis by researcher Rena A Kirkland in the journal North American Journal of Psychology found significant sex differences favoring females in "Reading of the mind" test. "Reading of the mind" test is an advanced ability measure of cognitive empathy in which Kirkland's analysis involved 259 studies across 10 countries. Another 2014 meta-analysis in the journal of Cognition and Emotion, found overall female advantage in non-verbal emotional recognition across 215 samples. Using fMRI, neuroscientist Tania Singer showed that empathy-related neural responses are significantly lower in males when observing an "unfair" person experiencing pain.  An analysis from the journal of Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews  also found that there are sex differences in empathy from birth, growing larger with age and which remains consistent and stable across lifespan. Females were found to have higher empathy than males, while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development. Further analysis of brain tools such as event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering had higher ERP waveforms than males. Another investigation with similar brain tools such as N400 amplitudes found higher N400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self-reported empathy. Structural fMRI studies also found females to have larger grey matter volumes in posterior [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal]] and anterior [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior parietal cortex]]  areas which are correlated with [[mirror neuron]]s in [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] literature.<ref name=":0"/> Females were also found to have stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy.<ref name=":0"/> The researchers found that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by any environment influences but rather might have some roots in human evolution and inheritance.<ref name=":0"/>  Throughout prehistory, females nurtured and were the primary caretakers of children, so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the ''Primary Caretaker Hypothesis'', prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers; so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.<ref name=":0"/>  ==Major theories and empirical findings== Research investigating the social response to natural disasters looked at the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims.

For example, one alternative explanation for the problem-specific helping pattern may be that the sequence of events in the same problem condition first made subjects sad when they empathized with the problem and then maintained or enhanced subjects’ sadness when they were later exposed to the same plight. Consequently, the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine-set subjects in the same condition, which is what occurred. An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping. If this is the case, then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur. This would allow for a stronger sadness-based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern-based altruistic motivation. The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation. Consequently, relative strengths of different emotional reactions, systematically related to the need situation, may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation (Dovidio, 1990). But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results. Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions. It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement. Thus, an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dovidio J.F., Allen J.L., Schroeder D.A. | year = 1990 | title = Specificity of empathy-induced helping: Evidence for altruistic motivation | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 249–260 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=1991-01135-001 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.249}}</ref>  Contemporary neuroscience has allowed us to understand the neural basis of the human mind’s ability to understand and process emotion.

Neuroscientists have already discovered that people scoring high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems in their brains (Dr. Christian Keysers). {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another’s emotional state. In a way we mirror or mimic the emotional response that we would expect to feel in that condition or context, much like sympathy. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another’s emotional response. Additionally, empathizing with someone requires a distinctly sympathetic reaction where personal distress demands avoidance of distressing matters. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathetic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.<ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"/> Empathy leads to sympathy by definition unlike the over-aroused emotional response that turns into personal distress and causes a turning-away from another’s distress.  In empathy we feel what we believe are the emotions of another, which makes it both affective and cognitive by most psychologists.<ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/> In this sense, arousal and empathy promote prosocial behavior as we accommodate each other to feel similar emotions. For social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able navigate the physical landscape.<ref>Bartlett, M. Y., and D. Desteno.  (2006) "Gratitude and Prosocial Behavior: Helping When It Costs You." ''Psychological Science'' 17.4 : 319-25.</ref> Emotions motivate individual behavior that aids in solving communal challenges as well as guiding group decisions about social exchange. Additionally, recent research has shown individuals who report regular experiences of gratitude engage more frequently in prosocial behaviors. Positive emotions like empathy or gratitude are linked to a more positive continual state and these people are far more likely to help others than those not experiencing a positive emotional state.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bartlett M.

Measures of empathy show that mirror neurons are activated during arousal of sympathetic responses and prolonged activation shows increased probability to help others.  Another growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and learners.<ref>McAlinden,M. (2014) Can teachers know learners' minds?

This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that it is more difficult to empathize when there are differences between people including status, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, age and so on.<ref name="Tettegah, S. 2007"/>  In order to achieve intercultural empathy, psychologists have employed empathy training. One study hypothesized that empathy training would increase the measured level of relational empathy among the individuals in the experimental group when compared to the control group.<ref>Keillor, Robin Michelle. "Empathy and Intergroup Relations: A Study in Cross-Cultural Relationship Building." Order No. AEH9940789 2000. ProQuest. Web. 13 Apr. 2014.</ref> The study also hypothesized that empathy training would increase communication among the experimental group, and that perceived satisfaction with group dialogue would also increase among the experimental group. To test this, the experimenters used the Hogan Empathy Scale, the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, and questionnaires.  Using these measures, the study found that empathy training was not successful in increasing relational empathy. Also, communication and satisfaction among groups did not increase as a result of the empathy training. While there didn’t seem to be a clear relationship between empathy and relational empathy training, the study did report that “relational empathy training appeared to foster greater expectations for a deep dialogic process resulting in treatment differences in perceived depth of communication”.  The environment has been another interesting topic of study. Many theorize that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, play a significant role in the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro social relationships, helps mediate aggression, and allows us to relate to others, all of which make empathy an important emotion among children.  A study done by Caroline Tisot  looked at how a variety of environmental factors affected the development of empathy in young children. Parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences were looked at. The children participating in the study were asked to complete an affective empathy measure, while the children’s parents completed the Parenting Practices Questionnaire, which assesses parenting style, and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale.  This study found that a few parenting practices - as opposed to parenting style as a whole - contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The results also show that the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was found to be significantly important, and was positively related to empathy within children, especially in boys. Interestingly, however, maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy within children, especially in girls.<ref>Tisot, Caroline Teresa Monforte. "Environmental Contributions to Empathy Development in Young Children." Order No. AAI3097734 2004. ProQuest. Web. 13 Apr. 2014.</ref>  ==Applications== The empathy-altruism relationship also has broad and practical implications. Given the power of empathic feelings to evoke altruistic motivation, people may unfortunately learn to suppress or avoid these feelings. This numbing or even loss of the capacity to feel empathy for clients may be a factor in the experience of burnout among case workers in helping professions. Awareness of this impending futile effort—such as nurses caring for terminal patients or pedestrians walking by the homeless—may make individuals try to avoid feelings of empathy in order to avoid the resulting altruistic motivation. Promoting an understanding about the mechanisms by which altruistic behavior is driven, whether it’s from minimizing sadness or the arousal of mirror neurons, allows people to better cognitively control their actions. However, empathy-induced altruism may not always produce prosocial effects. It could lead one to increase the welfare of those for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential prosocial goals, thus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Batson C. D., Moran T. | year = 1999 | title = Empathy-induced altruism in a prisoner's dilemma | url = | journal = Eur. J. Soc.

Empathy-based socialization is very different from current practices directed toward inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling and internalized guilt. Therapeutic programs built around facilitating altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in the long-term. At a societal level, experiments have indicated that empathy-induced altruism can be used to improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, even used to improve racial attitudes, actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless and even convicts. Such resulting altruism has also been found to increase cooperation in competitive situations.<ref>Snyder, C.R. and Lopez, S.J. (Eds.). (2009). Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology. Second ed.

Recent years have seen increased movement toward the idea that empathy occurs from motor neuron imitation. But, how do we account for individual differences in empathy? It cannot be said that empathy is a single unipolar construct but rather a set of constructs. In essence, not every individual responds equally and uniformly the same to various circumstances. The Empathic Concern scale assesses “other-oriented” feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures “self-oriented” feelings of personal anxiety and unease. The combination of these scales helps reveal those that might not be classified as empathetic and expands the narrow definition of empathy. Using this approach we can enlarge the basis of what it means to possess empathetic qualities and create a multi-faceted definition.<ref>Davis, Mark H.

Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths' empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests how psychopaths could switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say it is still unknown how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it could be possible to bring psychopaths closer to rehabilitation by helping them to activate their "empathy switch". Others suggested that despite the results of the study, it remained unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.<ref name="empathy switch">{{cite news |title=Psychopathic criminals have empathy switch |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>Lewis, Tanya.

In particular, empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions. Empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent. (See Levenson and Reuf 1997 and Hoffman 2000: 62). A measure of how well a person can infer the specific content of another person's thoughts and feelings has been developed by William Ickes (1997, 2003). Ickes and his colleagues have developed a video-based method to measure empathic accuracy and have used this method to study the empathic inaccuracy of maritally aggressive and abusive spouses, among other topics.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  There are concerns that the empathiser's own emotional background may affect or distort what emotions they perceive in others (e.g. Goleman 1996: p.&nbsp;104). Empathy is not a process that is likely to deliver certain judgments about the emotional states of others. It is a skill that is gradually developed throughout life, and which improves the more contact we have with the person with whom one empathizes. Accordingly, any knowledge gained of the emotions of the other must be revisable in light of further information.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Empathizers report finding it easier to take the perspective of another person when they have experienced a similar situation,<ref name=Gerace2015>{{cite journal|last1=Gerace|first1=A.|last2=Day|first2=A.|last3=Casey|first3=S.|last4=Mohr|first4=P.|title=Perspective taking and empathy: Does having similar past experience to another person make it easier to take their perspective?|journal=Journal of Relationships Research|date=2015|volume=6|issue=e10|pages=1–14|doi=10.1017/jrr.2015.6}}</ref> as well as experience greater empathic emotion.<ref name=Hodges2010>{{cite journal|last1=Hodges|first1=S.

Empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable. This is particularly the case where we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions. Based on a metaphorical affinity with touch, philosopher Edith Wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wyschogrod E | year = 1981 | title = Empathy and sympathy as tactile encounter | url = | journal = J Med Philos | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 25–43 | doi = 10.1093/jmp/6.1.25 | pmid = 7229562 }}</ref> The appropriate role of empathy in our dealings with others is highly dependent on the circumstances. For instance, [[Tania Singer]] claims that clinicians or caregivers must take care not to be too sensitive to the emotions of others, to over-invest their own emotions, at the risk of [[compassion fatigue|draining away]] their own resourcefulness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|title=Compassion over empathy could help prevent emotional burnout|work=Wired UK}}</ref> Furthermore, an awareness of the limitations of empathic accuracy is prudent in a [[caregiving]] situation.  ==Disciplinary approaches==  ===Philosophy===  ====Ethics==== In his 2008 book, ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time:Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'', philosopher [[Iain King]] presents two reasons why empathy is the "essence" or "DNA" of right and wrong. First, he argues that empathy uniquely has all the characteristics we can know about an ethical viewpoint<ref>''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong'', (2008), ISBN 978-1-84706-347-2</ref> – including that it is "partly self-standing", and so provides a source of motivation that is partly within us and partly outside, as moral motivations seem to be.<ref name="King2008-74">{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&lpg=PA227&dq=empathy%20iain%20king&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q=empathy%20iain%20king&f=false|accessdate=August 28, 2013|publisher=Continuum|date=16 October 2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=74|quote=Empathy is special, because it always and automatically has the characteristics of right and wrong&nbsp;...

In the 2007 book ''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', philosopher [[Michael Slote]] introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy. His claim is that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a basis of empathic response. He claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural. These natural obligations include a greater empathic, and moral obligation to family and friends, along with an account of temporal and physical distance. In situations of close temporal and physical distance, and with family or friends, our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally. Slote explains that this is due to empathy and our natural empathic ties. He further adds that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent.<ref>''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', Michael Slote, Oxford University Press, 2007</ref>  ====Phenomenology==== In [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and [[other]]. This draws on the [[sense of agency]]. In the most basic sense, this is the experience of the other's body and, in this sense, it is an experience of "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the experience is modified so that what is experienced is experienced as being the other's experience; in experiencing empathy, what is experienced is not "my" experience, even though ''I'' experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the condition of [[intersubjectivity]] and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.<ref>''Empathy in the Context of Philosophy'', Lou Agosta, Palgrave/Macmillan, 2010</ref>  ===History=== Some postmodern historians such as [[Keith Jenkins]] in recent years have debated whether or not it is possible to empathise with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant [[Liberalism|liberal]] discourse of modern society and can be connected to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the [[epistemological]] conditions of by gone ages we are unable to empathise.<ref>Jenkins, K. (1991) ''Re-thinking History'' London: Routledge</ref>  It is impossible to forecast the effect of empathy on the future.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A past subject may take part in the present by the so-called historic present.

Examples include [[dolphin]]s saving humans from drowning or from [[shark attack]]s. Professor Tom White suggests that reports of [[cetacea]]ns having three times as many spindle cells — the nerve cells that convey empathy — in their brains as we do might mean these highly-social animals have a great awareness of one another's feelings.<ref>White, T.

For University of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety, [empathy] is not specific to humans.

Since the first [[mammal]]s lacked a self-aware distinction between self and other, as shown by most mammals failing at [[mirror test]]s, the first mammals or anything more evolutionarily primitive than them cannot have had a context of default egoism requiring an empathy mechanism to be transcended. However, there are numerous examples in artificial intelligence research showing that simple reactions can carry out de facto functions the agents have no concept of, so this does not contradict evolutionary explanations of parental care. However, such mechanisms would be unadapted to self-other distinction and beings already dependent on some form of behavior benefitting each other or their offspring would never be able to evolve a form of self-other distinction that necessitated evolution of specialized non-preevolved and non-preevolvable mechanisms for retaining empathic behavior in the presence of self-other distinction, and so a fundamental neurological distinction between egoism and empathy cannot exist in any species.<ref>How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, 2006, by Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard</ref><ref>Intelligence of Apes and Other Rational Beings 2003, Duane M.

His principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material. The possibility of not applying the principle is granted in the cure, for instance when you must reckon with another principle, that of reality. Developing skills of empathy is often a central theme in the recovery process for drug addicts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  In evolutionary psychology, attempts at explaining pro-social behavior often mention the presence of empathy in the individual as a possible variable. While exact motives behind complex social behaviors are difficult to distinguish, the "ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person and experience events and emotions the way that person experienced them" is the definitive factor for truly altruistic behavior according to Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis. If empathy is not felt, social exchange (what's in it for me?) supersedes pure altruism, but if empathy is felt, an individual will help by actions or by word, regardless of whether it is in their self-interest to do so and even if the costs outweigh potential rewards.<ref>{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = Elliot | authorlink = Elliot Aronson | last2 = Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin | title = Social Psychology, 6th Edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-13-238245-8}} </ref>  ===Education=== An important target of the method [[Learning by teaching]] (LbT) is to train systematically and, in each lesson, teach empathy. Students have to transmit new content to their classmates, so they have to reflect continuously on the mental processes of the other students in the classroom. This way it is possible to develop step-by-step the students' feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have. Other research and publications by Tausch, Aspy, Roebuck. Lyon, and meta-analyses by Cornelius-White, corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.<ref name="Trevisani, Daniele 2005">Trevisani, Daniele (2005) ''Negoziazione Interculturale.

He states that lacking any sense of empathy, people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. Patnaik claims that the real opportunity for companies doing business in the 21st Century is to create a widely held sense of empathy for customers, pointing to Nike, Harley-Davidson, and IBM as examples of "Open Empathy Organizations". Such institutions, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to change more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredtocare.com|title=Wired To Care|work=wiredtocare.com}}</ref> In the 2011 book ''The Empathy Factor'', organizational consultant Marie Miyashiro similarly argues the value of bringing empathy to the workplace, and offers [[Nonviolent Communication]] as an effective mechanism for achieving this.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Empathy Factor: Your Competitive Advantage for Personal, Team, and Business Success |last=Miyashiro |first=Marie R. |year=2011 |publisher=Puddledancer Press|isbn=1-892005-25-5|page=256}}</ref> In studies by the Management Research Group, empathy was found to be the strongest predictor of ethical leadership behavior out of 22 competencies in its management model, and empathy was one of the three strongest predictors of senior executive effectiveness.<ref name=FinancialPost20130621>{{cite web |url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/06/21/forget-ethics-training-focus-on-empathy/ |title=Forget ethics training: Focus on empathy |last=Dowden |first=Craig |date=June 21, 2013 |website=The National Post |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ILr5ZAXa |archivedate=July 24, 2013 }}</ref>  ===Intercultural=== Intercultural empathy is the ability to perceive the world as it is perceived by a culture different from the subject's own. Empathy interculturally regards a variety of issues, such as the approach to time perception (deadlines, temporal precision, perspective time), how to negotiate with people from different cultures and organizations, and be able to integrate all possible difference of communication styles due to differences in culture. The literature distinguishes four levels of empathy, identified by the Italian researcher Daniele Trevisani (2005) that examines the dimensions useful for applying empathic component on the intercultural setting: # '''Behavioral empathy''': understanding the behavior of a different culture and its causes, the ability to understand why the behavior is adopted and the chains of related behaviors. # '''Emotional empathy''': being able to feel the emotions experienced by others, even in cultures different from one's own, to understand what emotions the culturally different person feels (which emotion is flowing), of which intensity, which are the emotional lives, how emotions are associated to people, objects, events, situations, in private or public aspects of different cultures. # '''Relational empathy''': understanding the map of the relations of the subject and its affective value in the culture of belonging, to understand with whom the subject relates whether voluntarily or compulsorily, who has to deal with that subject in order to decide, in work or life, what is his map of "significant others ", the referents, the interlocutors, "other relevant "and influencers affecting their decisions, who are enemies and friends, who can affects his/her professional and life decisions. # '''Cognitive empathy '''(understanding of different cognitive or prototypes): understanding the cognitive prototypes active in a given moment of time in a certain culture in a single person, the beliefs that generate the visible values, ideologies underlying behaviors, identifying the mental structures that the individuals own and which parts are culturally-depending" (Trevisani, 2005).<ref name="Trevisani, Daniele 2005"/>  ==Measurement== {{citation style|section|date=July 2013}} Research into the measurement of empathy has sought to answer a number of questions: who should be carrying out the measurement? What should pass for empathy and what should be discounted? What unit of measure (UOM) should be adopted and to what degree should each occurrence precisely match that UOM are also key questions that researchers have sought to investigate.  Researchers have approached the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.  Behavioural measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad-hoc behaviours in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviours have been captured on video by experimenters such as Truax (1967b).<ref>Truax, C. B. (1967). Rating of Accurate Empathy. The Therapeutic Relationship and its Impact. A Study of Psychotherapy with Schizophrenics. Eds. C. R. Rogers, E. T. Gendlin, D. J. Kiesler and C. B. Truax. Madison, Wisconsin, The University of Wisconsin Press pp.&nbsp;555–568.</ref> Other experimenters, including Mehrabian and Epstein (1972),<ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543">{{cite journal | author = Mehrabian A., Epstein N. | year = 1972 | title = A measure of emotional empathy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 525–543 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1972.tb00078.x | pmid = 4642390 }}</ref> have required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviours, or those of other people involved in the experiment, as indirect ways of signalling their level of empathic functioning to the raters.  Physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject's body. Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992;<ref>{{cite journal | author = Levenson R. W., Ruef A. M. | year = 1992 | title = Empathy: a physiological substrate | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 234–246 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.234 | pmid = 1403614 }}</ref> Leslie et al., 2004<ref>{{cite journal | author = Leslie K.

Bodily or "somatic" measures can be looked upon as behavioural measures at a micro level. Their focus is upon measuring empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions in the empathiser. These changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of "emotional contagion" or mirroring (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992*; Leslie et al., 2004*). It should be pointed out that these reactions, whilst appearing to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathiser, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, be reflecting the results of emotional reactions that are based upon more pieces of thinking through (cognitions) associated with role-taking ("if I were him I would feel&nbsp;...").  Paper-based indices involve one or more of a variety of methods of responding. In some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy (e.g. Geher, Warner and Brown, 2001<ref>{{cite journal | author = Geher G., Warner R. M. | year = 2001 | title = Predictive validity of the emotional accuracy research scale | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 373–388 | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(00)00045-3 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>); scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form (e.g. Mehrabian and Epstein, 1972<ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"/>). Measures also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to tap into the affective, cognitive-affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to have been able to tap into both cognitive and affective substrates (e.g. Davis, 1980<ref>{{cite journal | author = Davis M. H. | year = 1980 | title = A multidimensional approach to individual differences in empathy | url = | journal = JSAS Catalogue of selected documents in psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 1–17 }}</ref>). More recent paper-based tools include The [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ) created by [[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen]] and Wheelwright<ref>{{cite journal | author = Baron-Cohen S., Wheelwright S. | year = 2004 | title = The empathy quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger Syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences | url = http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 163–175 | doi = 10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00 | pmid = 15162935 }}</ref> which comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting of 60 items.  For the very young, picture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young, pre-school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers (e.g. Denham and Couchoud, 1990). Dependent variables (variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter) for younger subjects have included self reporting on a 7-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions (Barnett, 1984).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Barnett M. A. | year = 1984 | title = Similarity of experience and empathy in preschoolers | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 145 | issue = 2| pages = 241–250 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.1984.10532271 }}</ref>  A certain amount of confusion exists about how to measure empathy. These may be rooted in another problem: deciding what empathy is and what it is not. In general, researchers have until now been keen to pin down a singular definition of empathy which would allow them to design a measure to assess its presence in an exchange, in someone's repertoire of behaviours or within them as a latent trait. As a result, they have been frequently forced to ignore the richness of the empathic process in favour of capturing surface, explicit self-report or third-party data about whether empathy between two people was present or not. In most cases, instruments have unfortunately only yielded information on whether someone had the potential to demonstrate empathy (Geher et al., 2001)*. Gladstein (1987)<ref>Gladstein, G. A. (1987). What It All Means. Empathy and counseling: explorations in theory and research. G. A. Gladstein. New York, Springer-Verlag: 173-189.</ref> summarises the position noting that empathy has been measured from the point of view of the empathiser, the recipient for empathy and the third-party observer. He suggests that since the multiple measures used have produced results that bear little relation to one another, researchers should refrain from making comparisons between scales that are in fact measuring different things. He suggests that researchers should instead stipulate what kind of empathy they are setting out to measure rather than simplistically stating that they are setting out to measure the unitary phenomenon "empathy"; a view more recently endorsed by Duan and Hill (1996).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Duan C., Hill C.

Many instances of empathy have been recorded throughout many species, including (but not limited to) canines, felines, dolphins, primates, rats and mice {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In animals, empathy-related responding could have an ulterior motive such as survival, the sharing of food, companionship and pack-oriented mentality. It is certainly difficult to understand an animal's intention behind an empathic response. Many researchers{{Who|weasel|date=May 2014}} maintain that applying the term empathy in general to animal behavior is an act of [[anthropomorphism]].  Researchers Zanna Clay and Frans de Waal studied the socio-emotional development of the [[bonobo]] chimpanzee.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clay|author2=Zanna|title=Development of socio-emotional competence in bonobos.|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=November 5, 2014|volume=110|issue=45|pages=18121–18126|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&sid=181339d9-1520-40c7-a9e4-ce8ac385d6d9%40sessionmgr115&hid=120&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2013-39226-002|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316449110|bibcode = 2013PNAS..11018121C }}</ref> They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events, related to themselves (loss of a fight) and of stressful events of others. It was found that the bonobos  sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another. A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding, and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors.  Empathic-like responding has been observed in [[chimpanzees]] in various different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees are known to spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers Teresa Romero and co-workers observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees at two separate outdoor housed groups.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Romero|author2=Teresa|title=Consolation as possible expression of sympathetic concern among chimpanzees|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=July 6, 2010|volume=107|issue=27|pages=12110–12115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1006991107|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=11&sid=24706b87-cfc3-4942-8f8f-8d4fa8b29f28%40sessionmgr198&hid=128&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2010-14411-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712110R }}</ref> The act of consolation was observed in both of the groups of chimpanzees. This behavior is found in humans, and particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to individuals of kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.  It is thought that species that possess a more intricate and developed prefrontal cortex have more of an ability of experiencing empathy. It has however been found that empathic and altruistic responses may also be found in sand dwelling Mediterranean ants. Researcher Hollis studied the ''[[Cataglyphis cursor]]'' sand dwelling Mediterranean ant and their rescue behaviors by ensnaring ants from a nest in nylon threads and partially buried beneath the sand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hollis|first=Karen|title=A comparative analysis of precision rescue behaviour in sand-dwelling ants|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=March 2013|volume=85|series=Animal Behaviour|issue=3|pages=537–544|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.005|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&sid=bf4000d0-6a9c-4225-8ebf-82db56f427e8%40sessionmgr113&hid=128&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2013-01472-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}</ref> The ants not ensnared in the nylon thread proceeded to attempt to rescue their nest mates by sand digging, limb pulling, transporting sand away from the trapped ant, and when efforts remained unfruitful, began to attack the nylon thread itself; biting and pulling apart the threads.  Similar rescue behavior was found in other sand-dwelling Mediterranean ants, but only ''[[Cataglyphis floricola]]'' and ''[[Lasius grandis]]'' species of ants showed the same rescue behaviors of transporting sand away from the trapped victim and directing attention towards the nylon thread. It was observed in all ant species that rescue behavior was only directed towards nest mates. Ants of the same species from different nests were treated with aggression and were continually attacked and pursued, which speaks to the depths of ants discriminative abilities. This study brings up the possibility that if ants have the capacity for empathy and/or altruism, these complex processes may be derived from primitive and simpler mechanisms.  [[Dog|Canines]] have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-012-0510-1 |last=Custance|first=Deborah|author2=Jennifer Mayer|title=Empathetic-like responding by domestic dogs (canis familiaris) to distress in humans|journal=Animal Cognition|date=29 May 2012|volume=15|issue=851-859|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0510-1|accessdate=October 5, 2014|pages=851–859|pmid=22644113}}</ref> When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes, however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could insinuate that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, this could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.  When witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens, ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]]'' show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers Edgar, Paul and Nicol <ref>{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=J|author2=Paul|title=Protective Mother Hens: Cognitive influences on the avian maternal response|journal=British Journal of Animal Behavior|date=Aug 2013|volume=86|issue=2|pages=223–229|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.004|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&sid=c35dba7e-d8a4-4b46-8855-20319f7a74e3%40sessionmgr4001&hid=4214&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&AN=2013-21521-001 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref> found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hens heart rate increased, vocal alarms were sounded, personal preening decreased and body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if they were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality.  ==See also== {{columns-list|2| * [[Attribution (psychology)]] * [[Philip K.
