   In electronics, negative resistance (NR) is a property of some electrical circuits and devices in which an increase in voltage across the device's terminals results in a decrease in electric current through it. This is in contrast to an ordinary resistor in which an increase of applied voltage causes a proportional increase in current due to Ohm's law, resulting in a positive resistance. While a positive resistance consumes power from current passing through it, a negative resistance produces power. Under certain conditions it can increase the power of an electrical signal, amplifying it. Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few nonlinear electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current \scriptstyle v/i\,, and differential resistance, the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current \scriptstyle \Delta v/\Delta i. The term negative resistance refers to negative differential resistance (NDR), \scriptstyle \Delta v/\Delta i\;<\;0</math>.

Most materials, including the ordinary (positive) resistances encountered in electrical circuits, obey Ohm's law; the current through them is proportional to the voltage over a wide range. So the I–V curve of an ohmic resistance is a straight line through the origin with positive slope. The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in I–V graphs where the voltage \scriptstyle v\, is the independent variable) and is constant. Negative resistance occurs in a few nonlinear (nonohmic) devices. In a nonlinear component the I–V curve is not a straight line, so it does not obey Ohm's law. Resistance can still be defined, but the resistance is not constant; it varies with the voltage or current through the device. This source uses the term "absolute negative differential resistance" to refer to active resistance The resistance of such a nonlinear device can be defined in two ways, which are equal for ohmic resistances:, pp. 18–19, archived :R_\mathrm{static} = {v \over i} \,. It is the inverse slope of the line (chord) from the origin through the point on the I–V curve. In a power source, like a battery or electric generator, positive current flows out of the positive voltage terminal, opposite to the direction of current in a resistor, so from the passive sign convention \scriptstyle i\, and \scriptstyle v\, have opposite signs, representing points lying in the 2nd or 4th quadrant of the I–V plane (diagram right).

The tunnel diode circuit is an example. The tunnel diode TD has voltage controlled negative differential resistance. The battery \scriptstyle V_b adds a constant voltage (bias) across the diode so it operates in its negative resistance range, and provides power to amplify the signal. Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is \scriptstyle \Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r. For stability \scriptstyle R\, must be less than \scriptstyle r\,. Using the formula for a voltage divider, the AC output voltage is v_o = \frac{-r}{R-r}v_i = \frac{r}{r-R}v_i \,&nbsp;&nbsp;so the voltage gain is &nbsp;G_v = \frac{r}{r-R} \, In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance \scriptstyle r - R\, is less than the resistance of the diode alone \scriptstyle r\, so the AC output voltage \scriptstyle v_o is greater than the input  \scriptstyle v_i. The voltage gain \scriptstyle G_v\, is greater than one, and increases without limit as \scriptstyle R\, approaches \scriptstyle r\,. The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the superposition principle the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component \scriptstyle V_{bias},\;I_{bias} and an AC component \scriptstyle \Delta v,\;\Delta i. v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\, i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\, Since a positive change in voltage \scriptstyle \Delta v\, causes a negative change in current \scriptstyle \Delta i\,, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° out of phase. on Lloyd Butler's personal websiteThe requirements for negative resistance in oscillators, "For alternating current power to be available in a circuit which has externally applied only continuous voltages, the average power consumption during a cycle must be negative...which demands the introduction of negative resistance [which] requires that the phase difference between voltage and current lie between 90° and 270°...[and for nonreactive circuits] the value 180° must hold... The volt-ampere characteristic of such a resistance will therefore be linear, with a negative slope..." were first set forth by Heinrich Barkhausen in 1907 in Das Problem Der Schwingungserzeugung according to  This means in the AC equivalent circuit (right), the instantaneous AC current Δi flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC potential Δv, as it would in a generator. Therefore, the AC power dissipation is negative; AC power is produced by the device and flows into the external circuit. P_\text{AC} = \Delta v \Delta i = r_\text{diff}|\Delta i|^2 < 0 \,</math> With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an [[amplifier]],<ref name="Butler" /> or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.<ref name="Golio2" />  In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,<ref name="Lesurf" /> the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power<ref name="Lesurf" />  :<math>|P_\text{AC}| \le I_\text{bias} V_\text{bias} \, The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input. The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out. The device may also have reactance and therefore the phase difference between current and voltage may differ from 180° and may vary with frequency. As long as the real component of the impedance is negative (phase angle between 90° and 270°), the device will have negative resistance and can amplify. The maximum AC output power is limited by size of the negative resistance region (\scriptstyle v_1,\; v_2,\; i_1,\; and\; i_2 in graphs above) P_{AC(rms)} \le \frac{1}{8}(v_2 - v_1)(i_1 - i_2) \, The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from transmission line theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the incident wave \scriptstyle V_I\,, which travels toward the device, and the reflected wave \scriptstyle V_R\,, which travels away from the device. A negative differential resistance in a circuit can amplify if the magnitude of its reflection coefficient \scriptstyle \Gamma \,, the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave, is greater than one. |\Gamma| \equiv \bigg|\frac{V_R}{V_I}\bigg| > 1 \, &nbsp;&nbsp;where&nbsp;&nbsp; \Gamma \equiv \frac {Z_N - Z_L}{Z_N + Z_L} \, The "reflected" (output) signal has larger amplitude than the incident; the device has "reflection gain". The reflection coefficient is determined by the AC impedance of the negative resistance device, \scriptstyle Z_N(j\omega)\,=\,R_N\,+\,jX_N, and the impedance of the circuit attached to it, \scriptstyle Z_L(j\omega)\,=\,R_L\,+\,jX_L. If \scriptstyle R_N\,<\,0</math> and <math>\scriptstyle R_L\,>\,0\, then \scriptstyle |\Gamma|\,>\,0\, and the device will amplify. On the Smith chart, a graphical aide widely used in the design of high frequency circuits, negative differential resistance corresponds to points outside the unit circle \scriptstyle |\Gamma|\,=\,1\,, the boundary of the conventional chart, so special "expanded" charts must be used. Because it is nonlinear, a circuit with negative differential resistance can have multiple equilibrium points (possible DC operating points), which lie on the I–V curve. An equilibrium point will be stable, so the circuit converges to it within some neighborhood of the point, if its poles are in the left half of the s plane (LHP), while a point is unstable, causing the circuit to oscillate or "latch up" (converge to another point), if its poles are on the jω axis or right half plane (RHP), respectively. The equilibrium points are determined by the DC bias circuit, and their stability is determined by the AC impedance \scriptstyle Z_L(j\omega)\, of the external circuit. However, because of the different shapes of the curves, the condition for stability is different for VCNR and CCNR types of negative resistance:Golio (2000) The RF and Microwave Handbook, pp. 7.25–7.26, 7.29Crisson (1931) Negative Impedances and the Twin 21-Type Repeater, pp. 488–492 For nonreactive circuits \scriptstyle X_L\;=\;X_N\;=\;0\, a sufficient condition for stability is that the total resistance is positive :Z_L + Z_N = R_L + R_N = R_L - r > 0 \, so the CCNR is stable for Since CCNRs are stable with no load at all, they are called "open circuit stable". As above, for nonreactive circuits a sufficient condition for stability is that the total conductance in the circuit is positive :Y_L + Y_N = G_L + G_N = {1 \over R_L} + {1 \over R_N} = {1 \over R_L} + {1 \over -r} > 0 \, :{1 \over R_L} > {1 \over r}\, so the VCNR is stable for   In addition to the passive devices with intrinsic negative differential resistance above, circuits with amplifying devices like transistors or op amps can have negative resistance at their ports. The input or output impedance of an amplifier with enough positive feedback applied to it can be negative.. "Regeneration" means "positive feedback" If \scriptstyle R_i\, is the input resistance of the amplifier without feedback, \scriptstyle A\, is the amplifier gain, and \scriptstyle \beta(j\omega)\, is the transfer function of the feedback path, the input resistance with positive shunt feedback is R_\text{if} = \frac {R_\text{i} }{1 - A\beta} \, So if the loop gain \scriptstyle A\beta \, is greater than one, \scriptstyle R_{if}\, will be negative. The circuit acts like a "negative linear resistor" This source uses "negative resistance" to mean active resistance over a limited range, with I–V curve having a straight line segment through the origin with negative slope (see graphs). It has both negative differential resistance and is active {\Delta v \over \Delta i} = {v \over i} = R_\text{if} < 0 \,</math> and thus obeys [[Ohm's law]] as if it had a negative value of resistance ''−R'',<ref name="Franz" /><ref name="Hickman">{{cite book   | last = Hickman   | first = Ian   | title = Analog Circuits Cookbook   | publisher = Elsevier   | date = 2013   | location = New York   | pages = 8-9   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6__8BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=%22negative+resistance%22   | doi =    | id =    | isbn = 1483105350}}</ref> over its linear range (such amplifiers can also have more complicated negative resistance ''I–V'' curves that do not pass through the origin).

The two resistors <math>\scriptstyle R_\text{1} and the op amp constitute a negative feedback non-inverting amplifier with gain of 2. The output voltage of the op-amp is v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \, So if a voltage \scriptstyle v\, is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across \scriptstyle Z, causing current to flow through it out of the input. The current is i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \,  So the input impedance to the circuit is z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\! The circuit converts the impedance \scriptstyle Z to its negative. If \scriptstyle Z is a resistor of value \scriptstyle R, within the linear range of the op amp \scriptstyle V_\text{S}/2\;<\;v\;<\;-V_\text{S}/2</math> the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value <math>\scriptstyle -R. The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component. An NIC can cancel undesired positive resistance in another circuit, for example they were originally developed to cancel resistance in telephone cables, serving as repeaters. By replacing \scriptstyle Z in the above circuit with a capacitor \scriptstyle L\scriptstyle C, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized. A negative capacitance will have an I–V relation and an impedance \scriptstyle Z_\text{C}(j\omega) of i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \, where \scriptstyle C\;>\;0. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to discharge; its voltage will decrease. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an I–V characteristic and impedance \scriptstyle Z_\text{L}(j\omega) of v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \, A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit. NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables. There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor. Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate Foster's reactance theorem. One application being researched is to create an active matching network which could match an antenna to a transmission line over a broad range of frequencies, rather than just a single frequency as with current networks. This would allow the creation of small compact antennas that would have broad bandwidth, exceeding the Chu–Harrington limit. Negative differential resistance devices are widely used to make electronic oscillators. In a negative resistance oscillator, a negative differential resistance device such as an IMPATT diode, Gunn diode, or microwave vacuum tube is connected across an electrical resonator such as an LC circuit, a quartz crystal, dielectric resonator or cavity resonator with a DC source to bias the device into its negative resistance region and provide power. A resonator such as an LC circuit is "almost" an oscillator; it can store oscillating electrical energy, but because all resonators have internal resistance or other losses, the oscillations are damped and decay to zero. The negative resistance cancels the positive resistance of the resonator, creating in effect a lossless resonator, in which spontaneous continuous oscillations occur at the resonator's resonant frequency. Negative resistance oscillators are mainly used at high frequencies in the microwave range or above, since feedback oscillators function poorly at these frequencies. Microwave diodes are used in low- to medium-power oscillators for applications such as radar speed guns, and local oscillators for satellite receivers. They are a widely used source of microwave energy, and virtually the only solid-state source of millimeter wave and terahertz energy Negative resistance microwave vacuum tubes such as magnetrons produce higher power outputs, in such applications as radar transmitters and microwave ovens. Lower frequency relaxation oscillators can be made with UJTs and gas-discharge lamps such as neon lamps. The negative resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes but can also be applied to feedback oscillator circuits with two port devices such as transistors and tubes. In addition, in modern high frequency oscillators, transistors are increasingly used as one-port negative resistance devices like diodes. At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port. So high frequency transistor oscillators are designed by applying a reactive load to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below. The common Gunn diode oscillator (circuit diagrams) illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode D has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source \scriptstyle V_\text{b} biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is \scriptstyle dv/di\;=\;-r. The choke RFC prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source. \scriptstyle R is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit \scriptstyle LC, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with Kirchhoff's Voltage Law gives a differential equation for \scriptstyle i(t), the AC current \frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \, Solving this equation gives a solution of the form i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \, This shows that the current through the circuit, \scriptstyle i(t), varies with time about the DC Q point, \scriptstyle I_\text{bias}. When started from a nonzero initial current \scriptstyle i(t)\;=\;i_0 the current oscillates sinusoidally at the resonant frequency ω of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing exponentially, depending on the value of α. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between \scriptstyle R and \scriptstyle r, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit: Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started. A widely used rule of thumb is to make \scriptstyle R\;=\;r/3., Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Ocillators, p. 21 When the power is turned on, electrical noise in the circuit provides a signal \scriptstyle i_0 to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude. At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering \scriptstyle r to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance \scriptstyle r becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance \scriptstyle R\;-\;r and the damping \scriptstyle \alpha becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when \scriptstyle r\;=\;R. Gunn diodes have negative resistance in the range −5 to −25 ohms. In oscillators where \scriptstyle R is close to \scriptstyle r; just small enough to allow the oscillator to start, the voltage swing will be mostly limited to the linear portion of the I–V curve, the output waveform will be nearly sinusoidal and the frequency will be most stable. In circuits in which \scriptstyle R is far below \scriptstyle r, the swing extends further into the nonlinear part of the curve, the clipping distortion of the output sine wave is more severe, and the frequency will be increasingly dependent on the supply voltage. Negative resistance oscillator circuits can be divided into two types, which are used with the two types of negative differential resistance – voltage controlled (VCNR), and current controlled (CCNR) reprinted on Virtual Institute of Applied Science website   Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (X) as well as resistance (R). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a frequency domain technique due to K. Kurokawa. Eq. 10 is the necessary condition for oscillation, eq. 12 is sufficient condition. The circuit diagram is imagined to be divided by a "reference plane" (red) which separates the negative resistance part, the active device, from the positive resistance part, the resonant circuit and output load (right). The complex impedance of the negative resistance part  \scriptstyle Z_N = R_N(I, \omega) + jX_N(I, \omega) \, depends on frequency ω but is also nonlinear, in general declining with the amplitude of the AC oscillation current I; while the resonator part \scriptstyle Z_L = R_L(\omega) + jX_L(\omega) \, is linear, depending only on frequency. The circuit equation is \scriptstyle (Z_N + Z_L)I = 0\, so it will only oscillate (have nonzero I) at the frequency ω and amplitude I for which the total impedance \scriptstyle Z_N + Z_L \, is zero. This means the magnitude of the negative and positive resistances must be equal, and the reactances must be conjugate  R_N \le -R_L\,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X_N = -X_L \, For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start. Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the reflection coefficient. The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component V1 travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component V2 travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device \scriptstyle \Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \, is greater than one, while that of the resonator part \scriptstyle \Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \, is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if |\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \, As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the Barkhausen criterion for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient, so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions, which are often used instead. Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make amplifiers, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators. Because negative resistance devices have only one port (two terminals), unlike two-port devices such as transistors, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it. Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is bilateral; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems. To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use nonreciprocal devices such as isolators and directional couplers. One widely used circuit is the reflection amplifier in which the separation is accomplished by a circulator.H. C. Okean, Tunnel diodes in Chang, Kai, Millimeter-wave Planar Circuits and Subsystems in   A circulator is a nonreciprocal solid-state component with three ports (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode N is attached through a filter F to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance \scriptstyle Z_0 of the input and output transmission lines, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter F is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves. The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\, The output power from the diode is P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\, So the power gain \scriptstyle G_P of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient G_\text{P} = {P_\text{out} \over P_\text{in}} = {V_R^2 \over V_I^2} = |\Gamma|^2\, |\Gamma|^2 = \Bigg|{Z_N - Z_1 \over Z_N + Z_1}\Bigg|^2\, |\Gamma|^2 = \Bigg|{R_N + jX_N - (R_1 + jX_1)\over R_N + jX_N + R_1 + jX_1}\Bigg|^2\, \scriptstyle R_\text{N} is the negative resistance of the diode −r. Assuming the filter is matched to the diode so \scriptstyle X_1\;=\;-X_N then the gain is G_\text{P} = |\Gamma|^2 = {(r + R_1)^2 + 4X_N^2 \over (r - R_1)^2} \, The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for \scriptstyle R_1\;<\;r</math>.<ref name="Button" /> while a CCNR amplifier is stable for <math>\scriptstyle R_1\;>\;r. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as \scriptstyle R_\text{1} approaches the point of oscillation at \scriptstyle r. This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers, contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports. Masers and parametric amplifiers are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like radio telescopes. Negative differential resistance devices are also used in switching circuits in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with hysteresis. The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a relaxation oscillator, flip-flop or memory cell can be built with a single active device, whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the Eccles-Jordan multivibrator, requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are Some instances of neurons display regions of negative slope conductances (RNSC) in voltage-clamp experiments. The negative resistance here is implied were one to consider the neuron a typical Hodgkin–Huxley style circuit model. Negative resistance was first recognized during investigations of electric arcs, which were used for lighting during the 19th century. In 1881 Alfred NiaudetA. Niaudet, La Lumiere Electrique, No. 3, 1881, p. 287, cited in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Ed., Vol. 16, p. 660 had observed that the voltage across arc electrodes decreased temporarily as the arc current increased, but many researchers thought this was a secondary effect due to temperature. The term "negative resistance" was applied by some to this effect, but the term was controversial because it was known that the resistance of a passive device could not be negative.Emile Garcke, , also see letter by Andrew Gray on same page Beginning in 1895 Hertha Ayrton, extending her husband William's research with a series of meticulous experiments measuring the I–V curve of arcs, established that arcs had negative resistance, igniting controversy. Frith and Rodgers in 1896 with the support of the Ayrtons introduced the concept of differential resistance, dv/di, and it was slowly accepted that arcs had negative differential resistance. In recognition of her research, Hertha Ayrton became the first woman voted for induction into the Institute of Electrical Engineers. George Francis Fitzgerald first realized in 1892 that if the damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, it would produce continuous oscillations.G. Fitzgerald, On the Driving of Electromagnetic Vibrations by Electromagnetic and Electrostatic Engines, read at the January 22, 1892 meeting of the Physical Society of London, in  In the same year Elihu Thomson built a negative resistance oscillator by connecting an LC circuit to the electrodes of an arc, perhaps the first example of an electronic oscillator. William Duddell, a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson's arc oscillator to public attention. Due to its negative resistance, the current through an arc was unstable, and arc lights would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises. In 1899, investigating this effect, Duddell connected an LC circuit across an arc and the negative resistance excited oscillations in the tuned circuit, producing a musical tone from the arc. To demonstrate his invention Duddell wired several tuned circuits to an arc and played a tune on it. Duddell's "singing arc" oscillator was limited to audio frequencies. However, in 1903 Danish engineers Valdemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson increased the frequency into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field, inventing the Poulsen arc radio transmitter, which was widely used until the 1920s. By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it. Heinrich Barkhausen in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance. Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that mercury vapor lamps could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&T had used them to build amplifying repeaters for telephone lines. In 1918 Albert Hull at GE discovered that vacuum tubes could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called secondary emission. In a vacuum tube when electrons strike the plate electrode they can knock additional electrons out of the surface into the tube. This represents a current away from the plate, reducing the plate current. Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a decrease in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the dynatron oscillator. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the magnetron invented by Hull in 1920. The negative impedance converter originated from work by Marius Latour around 1920. He was also one of the first to report negative capacitance and inductance. A decade later, vacuum tube NICs were developed as telephone line repeaters at Bell Labs by George Crisson and others, which made transcontinental telephone service possible. Transistor NICs, pioneered by Linvill in 1953, initiated a great increase in interest in NICs and many new circuits and applications developed. Negative differential resistance in semiconductors was observed around 1909 in the first point-contact junction diodes, called cat's whisker detectors, by researchers such as William Henry Eccles and G. W. Pickard. They noticed that when junctions were biased with a DC voltage to improve their sensitivity as radio detectors, they would sometimes break into spontaneous oscillations. However the effect was not pursued. The first person to exploit negative resistance diodes practically was Russian radio researcher Oleg Losev, who in 1922 discovered negative differential resistance in biased zincite (zinc oxide) point contact junctions.Lee, Thomas H. (2004) The Design of CMOS Radio-Frequency Integrated Circuits, 2nd Ed., p. 20 He used these to build solid-state amplifiers, oscillators, and amplifying and regenerative radio receivers, 25 years before the invention of the transistor. and "The Crystodyne Principle", pp. 294–295 Later he even built a superheterodyne receiver. However his achievements were overlooked because of the success of vacuum tube technology. After ten years he abandoned research into this technology (dubbed "Crystodyne" by Hugo Gernsback), and it was forgotten. The first widely used solid-state negative resistance device was the tunnel diode, invented in 1957 by Japanese physicist Leo Esaki. Because they have lower parasitic capacitance than vacuum tubes due to their small junction size, diodes can function at higher frequencies, and tunnel diode oscillators proved able to produce power at microwave frequencies, above the range of ordinary vacuum tube oscillators. Its invention set off a search for other negative resistance semiconductor devices for use as microwave oscillators, resulting in the discovery of the IMPATT diode, Gunn diode, TRAPATT diode, and others. In 1969 Kurokawa derived conditions for stability in negative resistance circuits. Currently negative differential resistance diode oscillators are the most widely used sources of microwave energy, and many new negative resistance devices have been discovered in recent decades. rdiff&nbsp;>&nbsp;0Positive differential resistance rdiff&nbsp;Negative differential resistance Rstatic&nbsp;>&nbsp;0Passive:Consumesnet power Positive resistances: Passive negative differential resistances: Rstatic&nbsp;Active:Producesnet power Power sources: "Active resistors"Positive feedback amplifiers used in: Static resistance (also called chordal resistance, absolute resistance or just resistance) – This is the common definition of resistance; the voltage divided by the current: Differential conductance In a CCNR (S-type) negative resistance, the resistance function \scriptstyle R_N\, is single-valued. Therefore, stability is determined by the poles of the circuit's impedance equation:\scriptstyle Z_L(j\omega)\;+\;Z_N(j\omega)\;=\;0\,. on US Defense Technical Information Center website In a VCNR (N-type) negative resistance, the conductance function \scriptstyle G_N\;=\;1/R_N is single-valued. Therefore, stability is determined by the poles of the admittance equation \scriptstyle Y_L(j\omega)\;+\;Y_N(j\omega)\;=\;0. For this reason the VCNR is sometimes referred to as a negative conductance. r < R \Rightarrow \alpha < 0\,</math>: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance <math>\scriptstyle R and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit. So the circuit does not oscillate. r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,: (poles on jω axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude. This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator. r > R \Rightarrow \alpha > 0\,: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude. This is the condition during startup. Negative resistance (voltage controlled) oscillator: Since VCNR ("N" type) devices require a low impedance bias and are stable for load impedances less than r, the ideal oscillator circuit for this device has the form shown at top right, with a voltage source Vbias to bias the device into its negative resistance region, and parallel resonant circuit load LC. The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency. Negative conductance (current controlled) oscillator: CCNR ("S" type) devices, in contrast, require a high impedance bias and are stable for load impedances greater than r. The ideal oscillator circuit is like that at bottom right, with a current source bias Ibias (which may consist of a voltage source in series with a large resistor) and series resonant circuit LC. The series LC circuit has low impedance only at its resonant frequency and so will only oscillate there. Astable multivibrator – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a relaxation oscillator, and can produce square waves or triangle waves. Monostable multivibrator – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element. Bistable multivibrator or flip flop – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and digital counters.
