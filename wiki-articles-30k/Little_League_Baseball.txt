     Little League Baseball and Softball (officially, Little League International) is a non-profit organization based in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States, which organizes local youth baseball and softball leagues throughout the U.S. and the rest of the world. Founded by Carl Stotz in 1939 as a three-team league in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Little League Baseball encourages local volunteers to organize and operate Little League programs that are annually chartered through Little League International. Each league can structure itself to best serve the children in the area in which the league operates. Several specific divisions of Little League baseball and softball are available to children ages 4 to 18. The organization holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code.36 U.S.C. §§ 130501-130513, Chapter 1305—Little League Baseball, Incorporated The organization's administrative office is located in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The first Little League Baseball World Series was played in Williamsport in 1947. The Little League International Complex hosts the annual Little League Baseball World Series at Howard J. Lamade Stadium and Little League Volunteer Stadium, and is also the site of the Peter J. McGovern Little League Museum, which provides a history of Little League Baseball and Softball through interactive exhibits for children. Carl Stotz, a resident of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, founded Little League Baseball in 1939. He began experimenting with his idea in the summer of 1938 when he gathered his nephews, Jimmy and Major Gehron and their neighborhood friends. They tried different field dimensions over the course of the summer and played several informal games. The following summer Stotz felt that he was ready to establish what later became Little League Baseball. The first league in Williamsport had just three teams, each sponsored by a different business. The first teams, Jumbo Pretzel, Lycoming Dairy, and Lundy Lumber, were managed by Carl Stotz and two of his friends, George and Bert Bebble. The men, joined by their wives and another couple, formed the first-ever Little League Board of Directors. Stotz' dream of establishing a baseball league for boys to teach fair play and teamwork had come true. The first League game took place on June 6, 1939. Lundy Lumber defeated Lycoming Dairy, 23-8. Lycoming Dairy came back to claim the league championship. They, the first-half-season champions, defeated Lundy Lumber, the second-half champs, in a best-of-three season-ending series. The following year a second league was formed in Williamsport, and from there Little League Baseball grew to become an international organization of nearly 200,000 teams in every U.S. state and over 80 countries around the world. From 1951 through 1973, Little League was for boys only. In 1974, Little League rules were revised to allow participation by girls in the baseball program following the result of a lawsuit filed by the National Organization for Women on behalf of Maria Pepe.Little League: History and Mission: Chronology According to the Little League Baseball and Softball participation statistics following the 2008 season, there were nearly 2.6 million players in Little League Baseball worldwide, including both boys and girls, including 400,000 registered in Softball (also including both boys and girls). For tournament purposes, Little League Baseball is divided into 16 geographic regions; eight National and eight international. Each summer, Little League operates seven World Series tournaments at various locations throughout the U.S. (Little League softball and Junior, Senior, and Big League baseball and softball). 1939: Little League is established by Carl E.

The major divisions of Little League Baseball has their own World Series format as follows:  Tee Ball is for boys and girls ages 4–5, with local leagues given the option to allow 6–7-year-olds to play. In Tee Ball, players hit the ball off of a tee located atop home plate; live pitching is not allowed. The purpose of the division is to teach young children the basic fundamentals of hitting and fielding. The Minor League Baseball division is generally for children ages 7–11, with local leagues given the option to allow 6-year-old children to try out. Local leagues are permitted to further divide the Minor League division based on player age and/or experience, and often consist of coach-pitch (i.e., the batter's coach lightly pitching the ball) or machine-pitch at lower levels, with defensive players pitching at higher levels. "The 9–10 Year Old Baseball Division for boys and girls was established as a tournament program in 1994. It gives children of this age the opportunity to experience tournament competition, up to state level. Players on these teams can be chosen from among Major Division and/or Minor Division teams. The diamond used is a 60-foot diamond and the pitching distance is 46 feet."  "The Little League Baseball Division (sometimes known as the Major Division) is for boys and girls ages 9–12. A local league may choose to limit its Major Division to 10-, 11-, and 12-year-olds, or 11–12-year-olds. The diamond used is a 60-foot diamond and the pitching distance is 46 feet. The local league has an option to choose a Tournament Team (or "All Stars") of 11–12-year-olds from within this division, and the team may enter the International Tournament. The culmination of the International Tournament is the Little League Baseball World Series, featuring teams from around the globe. All expenses for the teams advancing to the World Series (travel, meals, and housing) are paid by Little League Baseball." In 2012, Little League announced plans to add a new division of play for the 2013 season, the Little League Intermediate Division.  This Division is played on a field with a  pitching distance and  base paths.  It is open to players ages 11–13, but may be limited to ages 11–12 or 12–13 by a local league.  Players in this division will be able to lead off and steal. Rules will follow rules similar to those of the Junior, Senior, and Big League Divisions of play. Little League holds a World Series in this level of play, officially called the Intermediate Little League World Series, in Livermore, California.Little League Announces Intermediate (50/70) Division  "The Junior League Baseball Division is a program for boys and girls ages 13–14, using a conventional  diamond with a pitching distance of .

Little League introduced the Challenger Division in 1989 to provide opportunities for children with physical and intellectual challenges to participate in the Little League program.  The Challenger Division utilizes a "buddy system" in which Little Leaguers assist Challenger participants in the areas of batting, running and fielding.  Challenger Division games are typically non-competitive in nature.   Introduced in 1989, the Little League Challenger Division is for participants ages 4–18.  Games are played on a 46/60 field and are non-competitive. Approved at the 2014 Little League International Congress the Senior League Challenger Division launched in 2015.  This division is for participants ages 15 and above (no maximum age).  Games are played on a 60/90 field and are non-competitive.  Leagues may request permission to play games on a smaller field as well. As of 2014, nearly 1,000 Little Leagues in 10 countries around the world offered the Challenger Program providing an opportunity for more than 30,000 individuals with physical or intellectual challenges to participate in the Little League program.

The playing rules for the baseball divisions essentially follow the "Official Baseball Rules" (as defined by and used by Major League Baseball and published at Official Baseball Rules at MLB.com), especially with respect to the upper divisions (Junior, Senior, and Big League).  Some major exceptions are outlined in the following sections, and these apply to Little League (Minor and Major, ages 7–12) except as otherwise noted. Unlike Major League Baseball and most other sports such as football, soccer, and basketball, the official rules of Little League Baseball are available to the general public only by online subscription ($20)  or as a printed edition ($7 plus $3 for "shipping and handling" within the US via UPS  ). In Canada, rulebook orders requested through LittleLeague.ca are routed to the US website at the same prices, except that "shipping and handling" to Canada via UPS is US$15.51, for a total of US$22.51 for a single printed copy.  Rulebooks are not available in sporting goods or other stores and must be ordered directly from Little League Baseball, Incorporated or one of its "Regional Centers".  One paper copy is provided to each team that has sent in an "Application for Charter and Insurance", although previously two copies were provided. Little League has been criticized for requiring payment to view its rules. However, the organization counters by claiming it has been exposed to lawsuits in the past in cases involving organizations not officially affiliated with Little League but which nonetheless use its rules. A regulation game is six innings.  If the game is called prior to the completion of six innings, it is considered an official game if four innings have been completed (three and a half, if the home team leads); otherwise, if at least one inning has been completed, it is a suspended game. In Intermediate Little League, as well as the Junior, Senior, and Big League levels (ages 13–18), a game is seven innings and is official if five innings have been completed. In all divisions except Senior and Big League, every player on the team roster must have at least one plate appearance and play six consecutive outs on defense in each game.  The penalty for a manager violating the rule is a two-game suspension.  This rule is waived if the game is completed prior to the usual duration of the game (six innings in Little League and below, seven innings in Intermediate Little League and Junior League).  This rule is modified during tournament play.  During tournament play, teams that have 13 or more players dressed at the field for a game are mandated to have one (1) "At Bat" during the game per player with no defensive requirement.  Teams that have 12 or fewer players dressed at the field for a tournament game require each player to receive one (1) "At Bat" plus six consecutive outs played in the field on defense. The size of the field is dependent on the division of play.Little League Rule Summary Tee Ball The distance between the bases is generally 50 feet. Minor League and Little League The distance between the bases is 60 feet and the distance from the pitcher's mound to home plate is 46 feet.  Outfield fences must be at least 165 feet from home plate, but are usually 200 feet or more (the fields at the Williamsport complex have fences 225 feet away).  The bases and pitching rubber are also slightly smaller than in standard baseball. Also, unlike fields at almost all levels of competitive baseball for teenagers and adults, the distance between home plate and the outfield fence is constant throughout fair territory. Intermediate Little League The distance between the bases is 70 feet and the distance from the pitcher's mound to home plate is 50 feet.  The recommended distance between home plate and the outfield fence ranges from 200 to 275 feet; unlike regular Little League, the distances can vary within fair territory.  As in regular Little League, the bases and pitching rubber are also slightly smaller than in standard baseball. Junior League, Senior League, and Big League The distance between the bases is 90 feet, the same as for regulation Major League Baseball fields. The distance between the pitcher's mound to home plate is 60.5 feet, also identical to that of MLB. The minimum outfield distance in the upper divisions is 300 feet (compare with MLB's official but not strictly enforced minimum of 325 feet at the foul lines), while the maximum for Big League is 425 feet.  (Base paths of 80 feet are optional for Junior League regular season play.)  Bats (all levels) may be made from wood or other materials (such as aluminum) and must be approved for use in Little League Baseball.  For the Majors Division and below, the maximum bat length is thirty-three (33) inches and barrel diameter may not exceed 2&nbsp;inches.  Beginning in 2009 all Little League bats must be labeled with a Bat Performance Factor (BPF) of 1.15 or lower. Bats for the Junior League level may have a maximum length of thirty-four (34) inches and a maximum barrel diameter of 2&nbsp;inches.  Bats for the Big and Senior League levels may have a maximum length of thirty-six (36) inches and a maximum barrel diameter of 2&nbsp;inches.  Non-wood Big and Senior League bats must meet the Batted Ball Coefficient of Restitution (BBCOR) testing standards that are currently used in the NCAA and NFHS (high school).The BESR (Ball Exit Speed Ratio) Intermediate Little League bats must meet Junior League specifications. When the pitcher is ready to pitch, a baserunner may not leave the bag until the pitch reaches the batter in Minor League and standard Little League. In the upper levels, including Intermediate Little League, the runner can leave the bag at any time while the ball is in play. If a fielder is waiting at the base with the ball, an advancing runner must attempt to avoid contact.  A runner may not slide head-first except when retreating to a previously held base. In the upper levels, runners must still make an attempt to avoid contact if possible, and may not maliciously initiate contact with a fielder. The upper limit of the strike zone extends to the batter's armpits.THE STRIKE ZONE: Location, Location, Location, Little League© Online In Tee-Ball, Minor League, and Little League (if 'uncaught third strike' rule is waived by the local league), the batter is out after the third strike regardless of whether the pitched ball is held by the catcher.  In Little League (both standard and Intermediate), Junior, Senior, and Big League, a batter may attempt to advance to first base on a dropped third strike if first base is unoccupied with less than two outs or if first base is unoccupied or occupied with two outs. If the batter is hit by a pitch, the batter gets walked automatically. Players who have been substituted for may return to the game under certain conditions, though a player who is removed as pitcher may not return to pitch. Pitchers in all divisions are limited to a specific pitch count per game and a mandatory rest period between outings.  These vary with age and the rest period also depends on the number of pitches thrown.Pitch Count Resource Page, Little League© Online Also, prior to 2008 a pitcher could intentionally walk a batter by simply announcing his intent to do so and not have to actually throw any pitches; however, beginning in 2008 the pitcher must now actually pitch the required four balls (which are counted against the pitch count).If the pitcher hits too many batters with the ball, or intentionally hit him, he is ejected from the pitching spot. Local leagues have a certain amount of flexibility.  For example, a league may opt to use the "continuous batting order" rule (4.04), under which each player on the team's roster bats, even when not in the defensive lineup.  Leagues may also waive the "ten-run rule" (4.10(e)) which ends the game if one team is ahead by ten or more runs after four innings.Rules of Little League, Seattle Community Network (scn.org)Little League Rules and Interpretations of Note, Western Maine Board of Baseball Umpires (wmbumpires.com) Division Location First Held Age of players Series Little League Baseball South Williamsport, Pennsylvania 1947 9–12 years old Little League World Series Little League Intermediate Division Livermore, California 2013 11–13 years old Intermediate Little League World Series Junior League Baseball Taylor, Michigan 1981 13–14 years old Junior League World Series Senior League Baseball Bangor, Maine 1961 14–16 years old Senior League World Series Big League Baseball Easley, South Carolina 1968 16–18 years old Big League World Series Division Location First Held Age of players Series Little League Softball Portland, Oregon 1974 9–12 years old[ ] Little League World Series (softball) Junior League Softball Kirkland, Washington 1999 12–14 years old Junior League World Series (softball) Senior League Softball Sussex County, Delaware 1976 13–16 years old Senior League World Series (softball) Big League Softball Kalamazoo, Michigan 1982 14–18 years old Big League World Series (softball) US regions: The East Region splits into the New England and Mid-Atlantic Regions.
