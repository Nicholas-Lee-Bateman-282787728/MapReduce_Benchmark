Later, while studying at Occidental College in Los Angeles, Affleck directed student films including one written by and starring his longtime friend Jay Lacopo. As an actor, he had a series of "knock-around parts, one to the next". He played Patrick Duffy's son in the television movie Daddy (1991), made an uncredited appearance as a basketball player in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie (1992) and had a supporting role as an anti-Semite in School Ties (1992).Vary, Adam B..

He played a football coach in the television series Against the Grain (1993) and a steroid-abusing high school football player in 'Body to Die For: The Aaron Henry Story' (1994). Affleck's most notable role during this period was as a high school bully in Richard Linklater's cult classic Dazed and Confused (1993). Linklater sought a likeable actor for the supporting role and, while Affleck was "big and imposing," he was "so smart and full of life ... I just liked him."Vary, Adam B..

Affleck spent a summer in Austin, Texas, while filming the movie and later said the most valuable lesson was how Linklater "empowered actors to improvise." Affleck's first starring film role was as an aimless art student in the college drama Glory Daze (1995), with Stephen Holden of the New York Times remarking that his "affably mopey performance finds just the right balance between obnoxious and sad sack." He then played a bully in the comedy Mallrats (1995) and began to worry that he would be relegated to "throwing people into their lockers for the rest of my career." However, he became friends with writer-director Kevin Smith during filming, and Smith wrote the lead role in his romantic comedy Chasing Amy (1997) for Affleck. Chasing Amy was a landmark moment for the actor.Vary, Adam B.. (January 14, 2007) The Voyage of the Mimi, Ben Affleck | Chasing Ben Affleck | Photo 2 of 15. EW.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-05. Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the "wonderful ease" with which Affleck played the role, combining "suave good looks with cool comic timing." Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote of a "wholesome and quick-witted" performance. Also in 1997, he starred as a recently returned Korean War veteran in the coming-of-age drama Going All the Way. Todd McCarthy of Variety found him "excellent" while Janet Maslin of The New York Times noted that his "flair for comic self-doubt made a strong impression." The success of 1997's Good Will Hunting, which Affleck co-wrote and starred in, marked a significant turning point in his career. The screenplay originated in 1992 when Damon wrote a 40-page script for a playwriting class at Harvard University. He asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him for the class and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script in earnest. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set in their hometown of Cambridge and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994, when Affleck was 22 years old. During the development process, they received notes from Rob Reiner, William Goldman and Terrence Malick (a friend of Affleck's godfather.) Following a lengthy dispute with Castle Rock regarding a suitable director, Affleck and Damon persuaded Miramax to purchase the screenplay. The two friends moved back to Boston for a year before the film finally went into production, directed by Gus Van Sant and co-starring Damon, Affleck and Robin Williams. Upon release, Janet Maslin of the New York Times praised the "smart and touching screenplay" while Emanuel Levy of Variety found it "funny, nonchalant, moving and angry." The film was a commercial success. Affleck and Damon won both the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Affleck has said that period in his life was "dreamlike": "It was like one of those scenes in an old movie when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black on to the screen. You know, '$100 Million Box Office! Awards!'" 1998's Armageddon established Affleck as a viable leading man for Hollywood studio blockbusters.Vary, Adam B..

After his screentest, director Michael Bay dismissed Affleck as "a geek" but was convinced by producer Jerry Bruckheimer that he would be a star. Affleck was required to lose weight, become tanned and get his teeth capped before filming began. He starred opposite Bruce Willis as a blue-collar driller tasked by NASA with stopping an asteroid colliding with Earth. Daphne Merkin of The New Yorker remarked: "Affleck demonstrates a sexy Paul Newmanish charm and is clearly bound for stardom." Later in 1998, Affleck had a supporting role as an arrogant English actor in the period romantic comedy Shakespeare in Love, starring his then-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow. Lael Loewenstein of Variety remarked that Affleck "does some of his very best work, suggesting that comedy may be his true calling," while Janet Maslin of the New York Times found him "very funny." Shakespeare in Love won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, while the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. Affleck then appeared as a small-town sherriff in the supernatural horror film Phantoms. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wondered how actors like Affleck and Peter O'Toole were "bamboozled into lending their talents to a junky little horror film": "Affleck's thudding performance suggests he is reading his dialogue for the first time, directly from cue cards." Affleck and Damon had an onscreen reunion in Kevin Smith's religious satire Dogma (1999). Janet Maslin of the New York Times remarked that the pair, playing fallen angels, "bring great, understandable enthusiasm to Mr. Smith's smart talk and wild imaginings." Affleck also starred opposite Sandra Bullock in the romantic comedy Forces of Nature, playing a groom-to-be whose attempts to get to his wedding are complicated by his free-spirited travelling companion. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly remarked that Affleck "radiates a sweetness that can't be faked ... He has the fast-break charm you want in a screwball hero." Joe Leydon of Variety praised "his winning ability to play against his good looks in a self-effacing comic turn." Affleck then appeared opposite Courtney Love in the little-seen ensemble comedy 200 Cigarettes. Affleck's next role was as a hardened criminal opposite Charlize Theron in the action thriller Reindeer Games (2000). After expressing an interest in a directorial career, Affleck shadowed John Frankenheimer throughout the pre-production process. Frankenheimer, directing his final feature film, described Affleck as having "a very winning, likable quality about him. I've been doing this for a long time and he's really one of the nicest." Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times enjoyed the unexpected casting choice: "Affleck often suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of Reindeer Games. Affleck then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crima drama Boiler Room (2000). A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck's performance was "traced over" Alec Baldwin's performance in Glengarry Glen Ross. However, Emanuel Levy of Variety praised his "bravura turn" while Peter Rainer of New York Magazine said he "does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next." In his final film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama Bounce (2000).Vary, Adam B.. (January 14, 2007) The Voyage of the Mimi, Ben Affleck | Chasing Ben Affleck | Photo 2 of 15. EW.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-05. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised "the understated intensity and exquisite detail of his performance ... His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined "people person" who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive." Also in 2000, he provided the voice of Joseph in the animated Joseph: King of Dreams. Along with Damon and producers Chris Moore and Sean Bailey, Affleck founded the production company LivePlanet in 2000, seeking to integrate the internet into mainstream television and film production. The four created the documentary series Project Greenlight, as well as the failed mystery-hybrid series Push, Nevada, among other projects. Project Greenlight was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002, 2004, and 2005. In 2001, Affleck starred in Michael Bay's war film Pearl Harbor. The film opened to a negative reception, but was a box-office success. A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck and Kate Beckinsale "do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." However, Todd McCarthy of Variety felt "the blandly handsome Affleck couldn’t convince that he’d ever so much as been turned down for a date, much less lost the love of his life to his best friend." Also in 2001, Affleck appeared in Kevin Smith's comedy Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, parodying Good Will Hunting with Damon and Van Sant. 2001 also saw the release of the comedy Daddy and Them, filmed three years previously, in which Affleck and Jamie Lee Curtis briefly appeared as married lawyers. In 2002, Affleck starred opposite Samuel L. Jackson in the thriller Changing Lanes.Vary, Adam B.. (January 14, 2007) The Voyage of the Mimi, Ben Affleck | Chasing Ben Affleck | Photo 2 of 15. EW.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-05. He later said the film was an "amazing experience," and that he learned from director Roger Michell. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian enjoyed the "strongly acted two-hander ... Affleck particularly shows how convincing he can be as the besuited corporate asshole." Robert Koehler of Variety described it as "his most thoroughly wrought performance since “Chasing Amy” ... the journey into a moral fog compels him to play more inwardly and thoughtfully than he ever has before." Also in 2002, he was cast as Jack Ryan, a role previously played by Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford, in the fourth film in the techno-thriller series The Sum of All Fears. Stephen Holden of The New York Times believed he was miscast: "Although Mr. Affleck can be appealing when playing earnest young men groping toward maturity, he simply lacks the gravitas for the role." Also in 2002, he appeared in The Third Wheel and was named Sexiest Man Alive by People Magazine. In 2003, Affleck was the subject of much media attention due to his relationship with Jennifer Lopez, with the actor himself remarking that it filled him with a sense of "dread ... People are going to grow weary of this." By the end of the year, Affleck had become, in the words of GQ, the "world's most over-exposed actor." His newfound tabloid notoriety coincided with a series of poorly received films. The first of these films was Daredevil (2003), in which Affleck starred as the blind superhero. Affleck was a longtime comic book fan; collecting comic books was his "whole universe" as a childCosmopolitan Magazine, April 1999  http://melinam.tripod.com/bcosmo.html and, in 1999, he wrote a foreword for Kevin Smith's Guardian Devil about his love for Daredevil. The film grossed over $179&nbsp;million worldwide but received a mixed response from critics. Elvis Mitchell of the New York Times felt Affleck was "lost" in the role: "A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role ... [Only his scenes with Jon Favreau have] a playful side that allows Mr. Affleck to show his generosity as an actor." In 2009, Affleck ruled out starring in another superhero film and, in 2014, he described Daredevil as the "only movie I actually regret." Affleck next appeared in Gigli (2003), co-starring Lopez.Vary, Adam B.. (January 14, 2007) The Voyage of the Mimi, Ben Affleck | Chasing Ben Affleck | Photo 2 of 15. EW.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-05. Gigli received almost uniformly unfavorable reviews, with Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times remarking: "A passable actor but a lousy star -- the bigger the movie, the worse he comes across -- Affleck doesn't have the chops or the charm to maneuver around (or past) bad material." Affleck has repeatedly defended director Marty Brest since the film's release, describing Brest as "one of the really great directors" and Midnight Run as his favourite film. He thanked Brest in his 2013 Oscar acceptance speech for Argo's Best Picture win. In his final movie role of 2003, Affleck starred in the thriller Paycheck (2003). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian remarked upon Affleck's "self-deprecating charm. Is there no one who can find this man a script?" Similarly, Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times commented: "Ben Affleck has had such a rough year (or so I've read) that it almost seems unfair to pick on either his newest film or latest nontabloid performance." Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly felt the film offers further proof that Affleck "comes most alive playing men whose handsomeness covers reserves of nastiness." Affleck's poor critical notices continued in 2004. He starred in the romantic comedy Jersey Girl, directed by longtime collaborator Smith. Stephen Holden of the New York Times described Affleck as an actor "whose talent has curdled as his tabloid notoriety has spread." However, Joe Leydon of Variety found his onscreen role as a father "affecting" while Mike Clark of USA Today remarked that the father-daughter scenes "bring out the best in Affleck." Later that year, he starred in the holiday comedy Surviving Christmas. Stephen Holden of the New York Times remarked that the movie "found a clever way to use Ben Affleck's disagreeable qualities. The actor's shark-like grin, cocky petulance and bullying frat-boy swagger befit his character." Allison Benedikt of the Los Angeles Times described Affleck as a "great talk show guest, bad actor" and categorised Surviving Christmas as a film "in which it just doesn't matter, in which he can simply be Ben." At this point, the quality of scripts offered to Affleck "was just getting worse and worse" and he decided to take a career break: "I was a little bit exhausted of myself and my life, so I wanted to try to control it or manage it."Silverman, Stephen M.. (November 29, 2006) Ben Affleck: 'I Would Love' More Kids - Ben Affleck. People.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-05. The Los Angeles Times published a piece on the downfall of Affleck's career in late 2004: "While the critics see Affleck as a big pinata and the tabloids see him as a reader magnet, few industry professionals seem to be gloating over Affleck's travails." Various producers and agents were interviewed, with Harvey Weinstein commenting: "He's one of the sweetest people I've ever met in this industry ... a great guy with an incredible personality and talent. I think the sky's the limit when he wants to focus. And he will." Affleck began to stage a comeback in 2006. While both Man About Town and Smokin' Aces were little-seen, Affleck won acclaim for his performance as George Reeves in the noir biopic Hollywoodland.  Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised "an award-caliber performance ... This is feeling, nuanced work from an actor some of us had prematurely written off." Geoffrey Macnab of The Guardian wrote: "He plays the part beautifully, capturing the character's curious mix of charm, vulnerability and fatalism." Manohla Dargis of The New York Times found Affleck "more than up to the task" of portraying Reeves as a tragic figure but was dismayed that he had "given this exasperating film far more than it gives in return." He was awarded the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. Also in 2006, he made a cameo in Kevin Smith's Clerks II. While Affleck remains a fan of Smith's work, they have communicated mainly via email since 2005.  In 2007, Affleck made his feature film directorial debut with Gone Baby Gone, a crime drama set in a working-class Boston neighbourhood, starring his brother Casey.Stein, Joel.

Jim Ridley of the Village Voice remarked: "Affleck has created something of a blue-moon rarity: an American movie of genuine moral complexity." Claudia Puig of USA Today described it as "an auspicious debut as a filmmaker" while Manohla Dargis of the New York Times praised the film's "sensitivity to real struggle ... Mr. Affleck doesn’t live in these derelict realms, but, for the most part, he earns the right to visit." Similarly, Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter praised the "thoughtful, deeply poignant, splendidly executed" film. In 2009, Affleck returned to acting, starring in three features. In He's Just Not That Into You, an ensemble romantic comedy, he acted opposite both Jennifer Aniston and Bradley Cooper. The film generated mostly mixed reviews, but was a box-office success, earning $165&nbsp;million worldwide. In State of Play, Affleck played Congressman Stephen Collins. The film is a political thriller which explores the relationship between politicians and the media. In the comedy film Extract, Affleck played an offbeat bartender. His performance in the film was well received. Claudia Puig of USA Today stated that Affleck "ought to do more quirky character roles rather than leading-man parts in action films." Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described his performance as "a goofball delight" while Manhola Dargis of The New York Times declared it as "a real performance." In 2010, Affleck starred in The Company Men as a mid-level sales executive who is made redundant during the financial crisis. His performance received positive reviews. David Denby of The New Yorker declared that Affleck "gives his best performance yet." Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said: "This is one of those roles tailor-made for Affleck's fast-break charm, his ability to play a winner cruising at too high an altitude." Richard Corliss of Time found he "nails Bobby's plunge from hubris to humiliation." In 2010, Affleck directed his second feature, The Town, an adaptation of Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves. Following the modest success of Gone Baby Gone, Warner Brothers Pictures had offered Affleck his choice of the studio's scripts. Along with directing and co-writing the film, Affleck was part of a cast that included Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, Chris Cooper and Blake Lively. A.O. Scott of the New York Times praised Affleck's "skill and self-confidence as a director." Claudia Puig of USA Today remarked: "Affleck has a keen eye for cinematic stories ... He may be en route to master-filmmaker status." Roger Ebert noted: "Affleck has the stuff of a real director. Everything is here. It's an effective thriller, he works closely with actors, he has a feel for pacing." Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times praised his "genuine gift for directing."  In 2012, Affleck directed his third feature film, Argo. The film, in which Affleck also starred, tells the story of a CIA operation to save six diplomats during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis by faking a production for a large-scale science fiction film. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said the film offered "further proof that we were wrong about Ben Affleck." Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly commented: "Affleck transforms its stranger-than-fiction hook into mainstream thriller poetry ... Having proved, with The Town, that he's a crackerjack director, Affleck now ups his game, applying a wizardly finesse to one of the darkest chapters of recent American history." Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times was impressed by Affleck's "instinct for storytelling." Peter Travers of Rolling Stone remarked: "Affleck takes the next step in what looks like a major directing career ... He directs the hell out of it, nailing the quickening pace, the wayward humor, the nerve-frying suspense." Argo won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Affleck was the first director ever who failed to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Director, yet went on to win both the Golden Globe and the Directors Guild of America awards for Best Director. He also won the Critic's Choice and BAFTA awards for Best Director. Affleck starred opposite Olga Kurylenko and Rachel McAdams in To the Wonder (2013), a romantic drama written and directed by Terrence Malick. The New Yorker 's Richard Brody described Affleck as "a solid and muscular performer" who "conveys a sense of thoughtful and willful individuality without weighing himself down with the emphatic acting-out of character traits." Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised "a performance of dignity and sensitivity" while New York Magazine's David Edelstein wondered why Malick chose to put "the camera behind Affleck’s broad back so that he becomes Everyhunk." Also in 2013, he starred in gambling thriller Runner Runner. The film received poor reviews but Affleck's performance as a poker boss was perceived as a highlight. Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post declared that his "nasty, natty crime lord is the one vivid character to pop out from an otherwise humdrum exercise." Andrew Barker of Variety: "Affleck threatens to make this whole film worthwhile ... Runner Runner’s appeal increases dramatically whenever Affleck enters the frame." Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times remarked that it was "one killer of a character, and Affleck plays him like a Bach concerto — every note perfectly played."  Affleck starred as a husband accused of murder in David Fincher's crime thriller Gone Girl (2014). Fincher cast him partly because he understood what it felt like to be misrepresented by tabloid media: "What many people don’t know is that he’s crazy smart, but since he doesn’t want that to get awkward, he downplays it. I think he learned how to skate on charm." Affleck pushed back production on his own directorial project to accept the role, and has said working with Fincher was "instructive and inspirational." David Edelstein of New York Magazine felt that Fincher's controlled style of directing had a "remarkable" effect on Affleck's acting: "I never thought I’d write these words, but he carries the movie. He’s terrific." Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised a "beautiful balancing act of a performance" while Justin Chang of Variety found Affleck "perfectly cast as Nick Dunne": "It's a tricky turn, requiring a measure of careful underplaying and emotional aloofness, and he nails it completely." In September 2015, the fourth season of HBO's Project Greenlight with Affleck and Damon began airing, a decade after the third season aired. (Their production company Pearl Street Films is named after the street that ran between their childhood homes in Cambridge.) He will play Batman in the March 2016 superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. While the casting of Affleck as Batman was at first met with backlash from some fans, there was later, in the words of the Washington Post, "grudging acknowledgement that Affleck could in fact be convincingly Batman-y." In October 2016, Affleck will star in Gavin O'Connor's The Accountant as a mild-mannered accountant who also works as a lethal assassin. In November 2015, Affleck began filming his fourth directorial project, Live by Night, an adaptation of the Dennis Lehane novel. Affleck wrote the adapted screenplay for the "big, sweeping gangster-epic morality story." The film, scheduled for release in 2017,Ben Affleck's 'Live By Night' Bumped To 2016. Huffingtonpost.com.

Affleck is also expected to direct and star in a standalone Batman film, and is co-writing the script with Geoff Johns. Affleck, who once worked on an adaptation of The Stand and was in contention to direct both Man of Steel and Star Wars: The Force Awakens, accepted the role of Batman in Snyder's film partly because he needed "a refresher course" in large-scale filmmaking. Affleck began to explore the possibility of becoming more actively involved in philanthropy in 2007 and was drawn to New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof's coverage of human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He made numerous trips to the region to educate himself through meetings with "academics, philanthropists, people at NGOs, people who work on the ground, survivors."  During two 2008 trips, Affleck reported on the humanitarian crisis for ABC News Nightline and directed a short film, Gimme Shelter, for the UN Refugee Agency. He spoke at the Combating Global Poverty event during the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In 2009, he wrote an essay for TimeChi, Paul.

Affleck also served as the executive producer of the HBO documentary film Reporter (2009), which focused on Kristof's work in the Congo. After five visits to eastern Congo between 2007 and early 2010, Affleck developed "a clearer sense of what I wanted to do ... A lot of NGOs were doing fabulous work there [but] there was no US-based group working with strictly community-based organizations in eastern Congo ... It seemed to me that there was a tremendous power in the ability to change one’s life if you’re part of the community, if you have skin in that game."  In 2010, Affleck and Whitney Williams co-founded the Eastern Congo Initiative. Investors include Howard Graham Buffett, Google, Laurene Powell Jobs and Cindy McCain. ECI supports "Africans finding solutions to African problems" by acting as a grant maker for Congolese-led, community-based organizations. ECI, with two employees in the US and 12 in the Congo, makes grants and offers capacity-building support to over 20 charities involved with supporting survivors of rape and sexual violence, reintegrating child soldiers into their communities, promoting economic opportunity, increasing access to health care and education, and promoting community-level peace and reconciliation. One ECI grantee, Green House, offers training and resources to Congolese farmers. In 2010, ECI partnered Green House-supported cacao farmers with Seattle-based company Theo Chocolate. As of 2014, Theo is the biggest sourcer of cocoa beans in the Congo and donates a percentage of its profits to ECI. In 2013, ECI collaborated with TOMS shoes to provide footwear for Congolese school children. In late 2014, ECI began supporting more than 4,000 coffee farmers to increase the quality and quantity of its production; its coffee beans are now exported by Starbucks. ECI has hosted high-profile fundraising events in the US, in collaboration with the Clinton Foundation and Matt Damon's Water.org.  ECI also aims to increase focus on the issues impacting eastern Congo among policymakers and the media in the US and Europe. In an effort to achieve this goal, ECI has released a number of publications including a white paper and a USAID-supported landscape analysis. Affleck has made nine media-documented trips to Central Africa since 2007 and has discussed ECI's work in many television interviews. In 2010, he wrote a column for The Washington Post, contributed an essay to The Enough Moment and appeared as a panelist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  In 2011, Affleck and Cindy McCain, an ECI board member, testified before the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights. Also in 2011, Affleck was a speaker at the Global Philanthropy Forum. In 2012, he spoke alongside Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at Washington's Child Survival: Call to Action Forum and alongside Senator John McCain at the Sedona Forum. He wrote op-eds for The Washington Post and Politico. During the Kony 2012 campaign, Affleck wrote an essay for The Huffington Post. While welcoming increased awareness of the issue of child soldiers, he warned that Western 'saviours' are "ineffectual at best and deadly at worst" and stressed the importance of funding "remarkable local organisations." Later in 2012, Affleck testified before the House Armed Services Committee and met with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In 2013, Affleck introduced  the Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste at a TED conference and began developing an Africa-set action film which Deadline has described as "an examination of the moral ambiguities of how philanthropy and foreign assistance veers into modern-day neocolonialism." Also that year, President of Rwanda Paul Kagame was photographed arriving at Affleck's Los Angeles home; Affleck had testified before Congress in 2012 about the Rwandese government's support of rebel groups in eastern Congo. In early 2014, he and US Special Envoy Russ Feingold testified before the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee and met with Secretary of State John Kerry. Affleck also spoke at the Hillary Rodham Clinton Awards, where Denis Mukwege was honored. Affleck has been a supporter of the A-T Children's Project since 1998. While filming Forces of Nature, Affleck struck up a conversation with an onlooker, ten-year-old Joe Kindregan, who has the rare disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). Affleck and Kindregan developed a friendship, communicating regularly via e-mail and phone. Kindregan and his family have visited Affleck on many movie sets and attended many premieres. Affleck is actively involved in fundraising for A-T and, in 2001, Affleck and Kindregan testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education, asking senators to support stem-cell research and to double the budget of the National Institutes of Health. In 2007, Affleck was the keynote speaker at Kindregan's high school graduation ceremony in Fairfax, Virginia. Kindregan appeared as an extra in Affleck's Argo (2012). In 2013, in celebration of "Joe Kindregan's 25th birthday as well as our 15 years of friendship with Joe and his family," Affleck and his wife Jennifer Garner matched donations made to the A-T Children's Project. Also in 2013, he appeared in CinemAbility, a film documentary which explores Hollywood's portrayals of people with disabilities.  Affleck visited troops stationed in the Persian Gulf during a USO-sponsored tour in 2003 and is now involved with two charities which support the US Armed Forces: Paralyzed Veterans of America and Operation Gratitude.

The conflict began when Harris mentioned "Liberals have really failed on the topic of theocracy. They'll criticize white theocracy. They'll criticize Christians...But when you want to talk about the treatment of women, and homosexuals, and freethinkers and public intellectuals in the Muslim world, I would argue that liberals have failed us." Harris later went on to explain how criticism of the doctrine of Islam gets conflated with bigotry against Muslim people. Affleck responded to Harris and Maher's position on Islam by saying, "It's gross, it's racist, it's disgusting. It's like saying, 'Oh, you shifty Jew!" Harris responded that, "No, we have to be able to criticize bad ideas, and Islam, at this moment, is the motherlode of bad ideas". Maher concluded, "One reason [moderate Muslims] don't get exposure is because they are afraid to speak out because it's the only religion that acts like the mafia that will fucking kill you if you say the wrong thing, draw the wrong picture, or write the wrong book", and reiterated that his position was based on facts; studies, polls and surveys taken in the Muslim world.
