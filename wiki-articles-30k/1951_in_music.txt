During the Nazi occupation of the Baltic state [Latvia] only small portions of the work could be performed. Eglitis later escaped to Sweden, but of Garuta nothing was ever heard. A new musical score was written by Bruno Skulte while he was in a German displaced persons camp." 2 Broadcast date of radio recording, NWDR Cologne.
