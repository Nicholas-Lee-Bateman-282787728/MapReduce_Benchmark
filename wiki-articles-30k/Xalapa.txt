    Xalapa (often spelled Jalapa, , )  (; ; officially Xalapa-Enríquez ), is the capital city of the Mexican state of Veracruz and the name of the surrounding municipality. In the year 2005 census the city reported a population of 387,879 and the municipality of which it serves as municipal seat reported a population of 413,136.Link to tables of population data from Census of 2005 INEGI: Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática. The municipality has an area of 118.45&nbsp;km². Xalapa lies near the geographic center of the state and is the second-largest city in the state after the city of Veracruz to the southeast. The name Xalapa comes from the Nahuatl roots xālli  "sand" and āpan  "water place", which approximately means "spring in the sand." It is classically pronounced  in Nahuatl, though the final  is often omitted; the  sound (like English sh) was written x in the 16th century. This does not occur in modern Spanish, and its counterpart is the  or  sound, normally written j. The spelling Xalapa (like the word México) reflects the archaic pronunciation. The full name of the city is Xalapa-Enríquez, named in honor of 19th-century Governor Juan de la Luz Enríquez. The city's nickname, La ciudad de las flores ("The City of Flowers"), was bestowed by Alexander von Humboldt, who visited the town on 10 February 1804. The reference is also related to the city's earlier colonial history. In folklore, the Spaniards believed that Xalapa was the birthplace and home of the Florecita, which literally means "little flower". Residents of Xalapa are called Xalapeños or Jalapeños, which is the name given to the popular long peppers cultivated in this area. The Totonacs were the first people to establish themselves around the Macuiltepetl, fifth mountain in Nahuatl language (Macuilli: five, fifth; Tepetl: hill, mountain). This mountain, an extinct volcano, received its name after the Aztecs used it as the fifth reference mountain to get to the gulf of Mexico's shores.  Today it is preserved within a park. During the 14th century, four cultures of indigenous peoples settled in the territory today known as Xalapa. Each of them built a small village: Xalitic (in the sand) was founded by the Totonacas; Techacapan (river of waste) was founded by the Chichimecas; in the northeast Tecuanapan (river of the beasts) was founded by the Toltecas, and Tlalnecapan was founded by the Teochichimecas. Eventually around 1313, the four villages grew and joined, forming one big village which was given the name Xallapan. Moctezuma Ilhuicamina, the fifth Aztec emperor, invaded the territory during the second half of the 15th century.  All the land was ruled as part of the Aztec Empire before the arrival and conquest of the Spanish conquistadores. In 1519 Hernán Cortés passed through Xalapa en route to Tenochtitlan.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, ISBN 0140441239  In 1555 Spanish Franciscans completed construction of a convent, the second-most important event in that time in Nueva España.  When the Spanish arrived, Xalapa was barely populated. The population rose after the conquest and colonial settlement. When the Spanish improved the Mexico-Orizaba-Veracruz route, Xalapa declined in importance as a  transport hub, with its population stagnating during the 17th century. From 1720 Xalapa became increasingly important, due to trade with numerous retailers of the New Spain arriving to sell products and to buy products cultivated and made in the peninsula. At this time numerous resident Spanish families in the near towns settled in Xalapa, so that by 1760 the population had increased to over 1,000 inhabitants, including mestizo and Spanish. The growth of Xalapa in population, culture, commerce and importance, increased dramatically in the 18th century. Responding to residents' requests, Carlos IV of Spain elevated the status of Xalapa to a town on 18 December 1791. In 1772, the construction of Xalapa Cathedral began. On 18 May 1784, José María Alfaro lifted the first air balloon in the Americas, in Xalapa. Due to the abundance of flowers growing in the region, Alexander von Humboldt, who visited the town on 10 February 1804, christened the town as the "City of the Flowers". Since the beginning of the 19th century, Xalapa was the scene of some important historical events, and it supported the movement for independence from Spain. Ideas greatly flowed in the town, and Xalapa was represented by many who put forward these ideas to those in Mexico City in government meetings. On 20 May 1821, shortly before completing Mexican Independence on 27 September of the same year, Xalapa was attacked by the forces of Don Antonio López de Santa Anna. Together with Don Joaquin Log, he forced Spanish captain Juan Horbregoso to surrender the town. Independence was gained months later; the first emperor Agustín de Iturbide was not warmly received in Xalapa due to past differences. On 9 May 1824, by decree of the President of the Republic Don Guadalupe Victoria, the First Legislature of the State of Veracruz was established in Xalapa. That same year, Xalapa was declared the state capital. In the 1820s Xalapa and the surrounding area was subject to a revolt when Vicente Guerrero replaced General Anastasio Bustamante. Veracruz was attacked by Isidro Barradas, who was attempting to reconquer parts of Mexico, and over 3,000 were deployed to defend the cities of Veracruz, Córdoba and Orizaba for military purposes. Anastacio Bustamante, betraying the confidence given to him, revolted against the legitimate government with a new plan of Xalapa, signed on 4 December 1829. The revolt was subdued. On 29 November 1830 by decree, Xalapa was elevated to the class of city. On 1843, Don Antonio María de Rivera founded the Normal School of Xalapa to train teachers. Today it operates as a preparatory school for students going to college. During the United States invasion of the Mexican–American War, in 1847 General Don Antonio López de Santa Anna attempted to defeat the opposing forces at a site near Xalapa in the Battle of Cerro Gordo. He led an army of more than 12,000 soldiers. Mexican troops suffered many casualties, around 1,000 were killed and 3,000 wounded on 18 April 1847. The US invaders occupied the city the following day. Among them was Lt. Ulysses S. Grant, later commanding General of the Union armies in the American Civil War.  Grant's letters call Jalapa “decidedly the most beautiful place I ever saw in my life;” its climate “the best in the world.”(Letter to Julia Dent April 24, 1847)   Xalapeños such as Ambrosio Alcalde and Antonio García fought bravely to defend the city of Veracruz, but were taken prisoner by the enemy. They were released and paroled, but after rejoining the fighting against the US, they were recaptured near Teocelo. They were taken to Xalapa and sentenced to death, executed on 24 November 1847. Today these two men are remembered as martyrs. An obelisk monument commemorates their sacrifice, standing between San Jose Church and Alcalde Market, which was named after Ambrosio Alcalde. The US forces after marching on to capture Mexico City departed after the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo. In November 1862 Xalapa was attacked during the French invasion; the foreigners temporarily took control of the state capital. On 27 November 1867 the corpse of the emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, who had been executed in Querétaro, arrived at Xalapa. It was held in the neighborhood of San Jose and attended to by the priest José María y Daza, before being transferred to Veracruz the following day. The emperor's remains were shipped back to Austria to be buried. In 1885 General Juan de la Luz Enríquez increased the power of Xalapa by moving some legislative authority from Orizaba to Xalapa, in accordance with the decree issued in June 1884 by the provisional Governor Jose Manuel Jauregui. General Enríquez together with the Swiss teacher Enrique C. Rébsamen, in 1886 founded the Normal School in Xalapa, the first school of this type in the country. Enríquez died in 1892, but the construction of Normal School and founding of other schools led to Xalapa becoming known for its centers of learning as the “Athens of Veracruz”. During the regime of Enríquez, the old convent of San Francisco was demolished, and the area developed as the Parque Juárez. In June 1890 railroad construction brought the first locomotive for the Xalapa-Coatepec-Teocelo railroad to the city. The interoceanic railroad was completed in Veracruz in 1901. The public lighting system was introduced in 1904.See William K. Boone In 1906 a clock was installed in the centre of the city on a building on Enríquez Street, which now houses the National Lottery agency. On 18 May 1911, Francisco I. Madero visited Xalapa. On 21 June of the same year a minor conflict occurred between federal forces and revolutionaries. On 3 January 1920, a strong earthquake rattled the city, destroying several buildings. Years later in December 1923, Xalapa fell into the power of the huertístas, commanded by Guadalupe Sánchez. In 1940 the water building and agricultural house were constructed, which today is occupied by the Agrarian League of Communities and Union Farmers of the State. On 11 September 1944 the Universidad de Veracruzana was established, and Dr. Manuel Suárez became the first director. On 4 September 1978 by means of decree number 325, the Local Legislature approved that the official name of the city Xalapa Enríquez should be written with a “X” rather than a "J", to emphasize its derivation from Nahuatl.
