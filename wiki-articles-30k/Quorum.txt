    A quorum is the minimum number of members of a deliberative assembly (a body that uses parliamentary procedure, such as a legislature) necessary to conduct the business of that group. According to Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, the "requirement for a quorum is protection against totally unrepresentative action in the name of the body by an unduly small number of persons." The term quorum is from a Middle English wording of the commission formerly issued to justices of the peace, derived from Latin quorum, "of whom", genitive plural of qui, "who"."Quorum," Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, 11th Edition. As a result, quora as plural of quorum is not a valid Latin formation. Each assembly determines the number of members that constitutes a quorum in its governing documents (such as in its constitution, charter, bylaws or standing orders). The quorum may also be set by law. Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised states that the quorum set in an organization's bylaws "should approximate the largest number that can be depended on to attend any meeting except in very bad weather or other extremely unfavorable conditions." In the absence of such a provision, a quorum in an assembly whose membership can be determined is a majority of the entire membership. In the meetings of a convention, unless provided otherwise, a quorum is a majority of registered delegates, even if some have departed. In a mass meeting or in an organization in which the membership cannot be accurately determined, the quorum consists of those who attend the meeting. In committees and [[Board of directors|boards]], a quorum is a majority of the members of the board or committee unless provided otherwise. The board or committee cannot set its own quorum unless given such power.<ref>{{Harvnb|Robert|2011|p = 347}}</ref> In a [[Committee of the Whole|committee of the whole]] or its variants, a quorum is the same as the assembly unless otherwise provided.   In online groups, a quorum has to be determined in a different manner since no one is actually "present".  The rules establishing such groups would have to prescribe this determination.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 99}}</ref> An example is that a quorum in such groups could be established as "present" if enough members state that they are "present" at the designated meeting time.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.aipparl.org/pdf/AIPemeet5.PDF|title = Electronic Meetings: Rules for Electronic (e-mail) Meetings or The E-liberative Assembly|date = July 2001|access-date = 2016-01-23|website = aipparl.org|publisher = American Institute of Parliamentarians|last = Stackpole|first = John D.}}</ref>  ==Determination of a quorum== The [[Chairman|chair]] of the group has the responsibility to determine if a quorum is present.<ref name=":1">{{Harvnb|Robert|2011|p = 349}}</ref> In addition, any member can raise a [[point of order]] about an apparent absence of a quorum.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#3|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 3)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-13|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}</ref> Because it is difficult to determine exactly when a quorum was lost, points of order relating to the absence of a quorum are "generally not permitted to affect prior action; but upon clear and convincing proof, such a point of order can be given effect retrospectively by a ruling of the presiding officer, subject to [[Appeal (motion)|appeal]]."<ref name=":1" />  == Limited actions in the absence of a quorum == When a quorum is not met, the assembly can only take limited procedural actions.

Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]] of [[West Virginia]], then the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], moved a call of the house after the minority [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] walked out in an attempt to deny the Senate a quorum after Senate aides began bringing [[Camp bed|cots]] into the Senate [[cloakroom]]s in preparation for an all-night session over [[campaign finance reform]] for congressional elections. Byrd's motion was approved 45-3 and [[arrest warrant]]s were signed for all 46 Republicans. [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate|Senate Sergeant-at-Arms]] [[Henry K. Giugni]] and his staff searched the Capitol's corridor and [[Congressional office buildings|Senate office buildings]] for absent Senators, and after checking several empty offices, spotted Senator [[Steve Symms]] of [[Idaho]], who fled down a hallway and escaped arrest. After a cleaning woman gave a tip that Senator [[Robert Packwood]] of [[Oregon]] was in his office, Giugni opened the door with a [[skeleton key]]. Packwood attempted to shove the door closed, but Giugni and two assistants pushed it open. Packwood was "carried feet-first into the Senate chamber by three plainclothes officers" and sustained bruised [[knuckles]].<ref name="latimes1988">Lauter, David.

Taking place just days after [[United States Senate elections, 1942|midterm elections]] had resulted in the loss of nine seats. Democratic Majority Leader [[Alben W. Barkley]] obtained an order on a Saturday session on November 14, 1942 directing Sergeant at Arms Chesley W. Jurney to round up the five Southern absentees to obtain a quorum. Jurney sent his Deputy Sergeant at Arms, J. Mark Trice, to the apartment of Democratic Senator [[Kenneth McKellar]] of [[Tennessee]] at the [[Mayflower Hotel]]. Then 73 years old and the third-most [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior Senator]], McKellar was later described by Republican Senator [[Bill Frist]] in his book on Tennessee senators as an "extraordinarily shrewd man of husky dimensions with a long memory and a short fuse." Trice called from the lobby, but McKellar refused to answer his phone, so the deputy sergeant at arms walked up to the apartment and convinced the senator's [[maid]] to let him in:<ref name="senate1942">"[http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Getting_even.htm November 14, 1942: Arrests Compel Senate Quorum]."

This generally only happens where the quorum is a super-majority, as quorums of a majority or less of the membership mean that the support of a majority of members is always sufficient for the quorum (as well as for passage). Rules to discourage quorum-busting have been adopted by legislative bodies, such as the call of the house, outlined above.  Quorum-busting has been used for centuries. For instance, during his time in the state legislature, [[Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln#Illinois State Bank|Abraham Lincoln]] leapt out of a first story window (the doors of the [[Old State Capitol State Historic Site (Illinois)|Capitol]] had been locked to prevent legislators from fleeing) in a failed attempt to prevent a quorum from being present.<ref>{{cite book|last=Donald|first=David Herbert|title=Lincoln|year=1995|publisher=Random House|page=77}}</ref>  A recent prominent example of quorum-busting occurred during the [[2003 Texas redistricting]], in which the majority [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in the [[Texas House of Representatives]] sought to carry out a controversial mid-decade congressional [[redistricting]] [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] which would have favored Republicans by displacing five Democratic U.S. Representatives from Texas (the [[Texas Five]]) from their districts. The House [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], certain of defeat if a quorum were present, took a plane to the neighboring state of [[Oklahoma]] to prevent a quorum from being present (and thus the passage of the bill). The group gained the nickname "the [[Killer Ds]]."  Similarly, the minority Democrats in the [[Texas Legislature]]'s [[upper chamber]], the [[Texas Senate]], fled to [[New Mexico]] to prevent a quorum of the Senate to prevent a redistricting bill from being considered during a [[special session]]. The [[Texas Eleven]] stayed in New Mexico for 46 days before [[John Whitmire]] returned to Texas, creating a quorum. Because there was now no point in staying in New Mexico, the remaining ten members of the Texas Eleven returned to Texas to vote in opposition to the bill.  During the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]], fourteen Democratic members of the [[Wisconsin Senate]] went to Illinois in order to bust the necessary 20-member quorum. Democrats in the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] did the same in order to block another union-related bill, causing the legislative clock on the bill to expire. Traveling out of their state placed these legislators beyond the jurisdiction of state troopers who could compel them to return to the chamber.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703842004576162911431447084.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |work=Wall Street Journal |title=Indiana GOP Drops Union Bill, but Democrats Stay Out of State |date=February 24, 2011 |first=Thomas M. |last=Burton}}</ref>  ==Disappearing quorum== The similar tactic of '''disappearing quorum''' (refusing to vote although physically present on the floor) was used by the minority to block votes in the United States House of Representatives until 1890. That year, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Thomas Brackett Reed]] ordered that members who were present but [[Abstention|abstaining]] would count in the quorum.<ref>{{Cite web|title = A Pre-Twentieth Century Look at the House Committee on Rules, The Reed Rules|url = http://archives.democrats.rules.house.gov/archives/pre20th_rules.htm|website = archives.democrats.rules.house.gov|access-date = 2016-01-27|publisher = The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Rules|date = December 1998|last = Oleszek|first = Walter J.}}</ref>  ==By country==  ===Australia=== Sections 22 and 39 of the [[Constitution of Australia]] set the quorum for sittings of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Australian Senate|Senate]] at one-third of the whole number of MPs and senators, respectively, but [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] is permitted to change the quorum for each House by ordinary legislation.  In the House of Representatives, the quorum was amended down to one-fifth by the House of Representatives (Quorum) Act 1989, which means the quorum of the current House of 150 MPs is 30 MPs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/pubs/gtp/chapter4.htm |title=Guide to Procedures |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date=2005-03-18 |accessdate=2010-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20081221185344/http://www.aph.gov.au:80/house/pubs/gtp/chapter4.htm |archivedate=December 21, 2008 }}</ref> In the senate, the quorum was amended down to one-quarter by the Senate (Quorum) Act 1991, so 19 senators is a quorum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/odgers/chap0802.htm |title=Chapter 8, Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Eleventh Edition |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080815185831/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/odgers/chap0802.htm |archivedate=August 15, 2008 }}</ref> The quorum includes the occupant of the [[President of the Australian Senate|Chair]] and is not reduced by the death or resignation of a member or senator.  If at the beginning of a sitting the quorum is not met, the bells are rung for five minutes and a count is then taken; if the quorum is still not met the sitting is adjourned until the next sitting day. During the sitting, any MP or senator may draw attention to the lack of quorum in which the bells are rung for four minutes, and if a quorum is still not met the sitting is adjourned.  Although quorum-busting is virtually unheard of in Australia, it is not unknown for parties to deliberately use quorum counts as a disruptive tactic and there have been some suggestions to enact rules to restrict this practice; however, this is very difficult due to the explicit mention of a quorum in the constitution. It is considered disorderly to call attention to quorum when one exists and members or senators who do so can be punished.  === Austria === In the [[National Council of Austria]] at least one third of the representatives must be present, so that they may decide on a simple law (participation quorum of 33.3%). At least half of the members must participate if a constitutional law should pass the parliament (participation quorum of 50% based on the total number of members). Over and above that, constitutional laws require the consent of at least two-thirds of the members present (quorum agreement of 66.6% based on the number of voting present).  ===Canada=== In Canada, the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] sets quorum for sittings of the [[House of Commons of Canada]] at 20 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]]. If a member calls for quorum to be counted and a first count shows there are fewer than 20 members, bells are rung to call in the members; if after 15 minutes there are still fewer than 20 members, the session is adjourned to the next sitting day; the members present sign a roll on the table of the house, and this list is included in the Journal of the House. There is no need for quorum when the attendance of the House is requested in the [[Senate of Canada]], for example when [[Royal Assent]] is being given to bills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/MarleauMontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?DocId=1001&Sec=Ch09&Seq=3&Lang=E |title=Marleau, Robert, and Camille Montpetit, eds.

Between 1997 and 2012 the quorum was 30, and since 2012 it has been 35. Prior to 1997 [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]], the quorum was set at 20.  The quorum for the [[Select committee (Westminster system)|panels, committees and subcommittees]] is, nevertheless, one-third or three members, whichever the greater, as according to the Rules of Procedure. The three standing committees, namely, the Finance Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and Committee on Members' Interests, is exceptional that the quorums are 9, 3 and 3 respectively.  Quorum-busting was used at least twice since 1997. In 2005, when some [[Pan-democracy camp|pro-democracy members]] of the council paid a silent tribute to late leader of the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Zhao Ziyang]], against the Rules of Procedure, the [[President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong|president of the council]] suspended the meeting. When the meeting was recalled, [[Pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing members]] refused to return to the chamber, forcing the meeting to be adjourned.  On 27 January 2010, when five pro-democracy members were intending to make their resignation speeches, pro-Beijing members of the council left the chamber as a sign of protest. One of the pro-Beijing members nevertheless stayed in the chamber to call for the quorum to be counted, effectively forcing the meeting to be adjourned. The resignation was intended as a [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|''de facto'' referendum]] across all five [[Geographical constituency|geographical constituencies]] of the territory, involving the entire electorate, which would not be officially recognised anyway. Most other factions, although against the move by these five Members, stayed in the chamber.  On 2 May 2012, when the LegCo was debating a law change to bar resigning legislators to participate in by-elections in 6 months, effectively discouraging any more "de facto" referenda, some of the five pro-democracy members who resigned constantly issued quorum calls, especially when they were making their resignation speeches intended for 2 years before. In the nine-hour meeting, 23 quorum calls were issued, taking up to 3 hours. When LegCo reconvened on 3 May, it was adjourned for lack of quorum amid a boycott by the pan-democrats. The pro-government members drew a timetable to ensure a quorum, but it failed to prevent another lack of quorum.  On 18 June 2015, when the LegCo was due to vote on a [[2014–15 Hong Kong electoral reform|resolution to amend the provisions for the election of the territory's Chief Executive]], pro-Beijing members left the chamber to force a quorum roll call to make sure that a sick member could be able to rush back to the chamber. However some of the members stayed behind, citing miscommunication, and the division proceeded with two members above the required quorum of 35. While the resolution was originally predicted to be narrowly defeated due to not able to get super-majority support votes, it turned out to be a landslide defeat.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-18/one-sick-lawmaker-makes-vote-on-hong-kong-democracy-a-landslide One Sick Lawmaker Makes Vote on Hong Kong Democracy a Landslide - Bloomberg Business]</ref>  Quorum-busting and attempts to thwart it are also a common feature during the annual motion debate related to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen massacre]] moved by pro-democracy Members. The quorum is called to be counted from time to time by the pan-democrats, in order to force the pro-Beijing camp to keep some members in the chamber.  === India === {{further|Constitution of India|Parliament of India}}  [[s:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 100 .7BVoting in Houses, power of Houses to act notwithstanding vacancies and quorum.7D|Article 100]] of the [[Constitution of India]] stipulates that at least 10% of total number of members of the House must be present to constitute the quorum to constitute a meeting of either House of [[Parliament of India|Parliament]].

The chamber of Dail Eireann is rarely full outside question time, with often just one government representative (often an ordinary member of parliament not a minister) present to answer opposition questions.  ===Turkey===  According to article 96 of the [[Turkish Constitution]], unless otherwise stipulated in the Constitution, the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] shall convene with at least, one-third of the total number of members (184 out of 550) and shall take decisions by an absolute majority of those present; however, the quorum for decisions can, under no circumstances, be less than a quarter plus one of the total number of members.  Before the [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2007|constitutional referendum of 2007]], there was a quorum of two-third required in the Turkish Parliament. The opposition parties used the quorum to deadlock the [[Turkish presidential election, 2007|presidential election of 2007]], making it impossible for the parliament to choose a president. As a result, the ruling AK party proposed a referendum to lower the quorum. Nearly seventy percent of the participants supported the constitutional changes.  ===United Kingdom=== In the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] has a quorum of 40 MPs, including the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]], out of 650 members of the House. There is no need for a quorum to be present at all times. Commons debates could theoretically continue even if just one MP and the Speaker were present. However, if a [[Division of the assembly|division]] is called and fewer than 40 MPs are present, then a decision on the business being considered is postponed and the House moves on to consider the next item of business. The quorum for votes on legislation in the [[House of Lords]] is 30, but just three of the 753 [[Peerage|peers]], including the [[Lord Speaker]], are required to be present for a debate to take place.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82488.stm Quorum]" (October 23, 2008). BBC.</ref>  Historically, the Quorum was a select group of the [[Justices of the Peace]] in each county in the [[Early Modern Britain]]. In theory, they were men experienced in law, but many of the Quorum were appointed because of their status. Some legislation required the involvement of a member of the Quorum, (e.g., granting a licence to a [[badger (person)|badger]]). In practice, they increasingly were not qualified, as the proportion in the Quorum rose faster than proportion who were called to the bar or practising lawyers. By 1532, an average 45% of Justices of the Peace nationally were of the Quorum. In [[Somerset]], the proportion rose from 52% in 1562 to 93% in 1636. By then, most of those not on the Quorum were new to the bench. Sometimes. Justices of the Peace were removed from the Quorum as a disciplinary measure less drastic than removal from the bench.<ref>Gleason, J.H. The Justice of the Peace in England 1558-1640, Oxford, 1969</ref>  ===United Nations=== The large deliberative bodies of the [[United Nations]] (the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], as well as their subsidiary organs) generally require the attendance of one-third of the membership (currently 65 states in the General Assembly and 18 in ECOSOC) to conduct most business, but a majority of members (currently 97 states in the General Assembly and 28 states in ECOSOC) in order to take any substantive decisions.<ref>{{cite web | url    = http://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/plenary.shtml | title  = UN General Assembly Rules of Procedure | author = [[United Nations General Assembly]] | date   =  | work   =  | publisher  = [[United Nations]]  | accessdate = 23 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url    = http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/pdf/rules.pdf | title  = UN Economic and Social Council Rules of Procedure | author = [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] | date   =  | work   =  | publisher  = [[United Nations]]  | accessdate = 23 April 2012 }}</ref> The rules of the [[United Nations Security Council]] make no provisions for quorum, but nine votes are in all cases required to pass any substantive measure, effectively meaning that a meeting with fewer than nine members in attendance is pointless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/scrules.htm |title=UN Security Council Provisional Rules of Procedure |author=[[United Nations Security Council]] |year=1983 |work= |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120502062010/http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/scrules.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2012 }}</ref>  ===United States=== [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section 5, Clause 1]] of the [[United States Constitution]] provides that "Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business..."
