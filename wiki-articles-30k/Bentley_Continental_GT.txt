   The Bentley Continental GT is a grand tourer produced by British automaker Bentley Motors since 2003. It was the first car released by Bentley under Volkswagen AG-management after their acquisition of the company in 1998, and the first ever Bentley to employ "mass production" manufacturing techniques. It shares a platform with the Volkswagen Phaeton. The Continental GT has transformed the company into a major global brand. In 1994 Rolls Royce Motors (who at that time owned the Bentley brand) previewed a convertible concept car at the Geneva Motor Show - the Concept Java. The car was designed to be a highly desirable Bentley, but smaller,  more affordable, yet still exclusive in order to maintain the integrity of the brand. It was to appeal to a new range of potential buyers and generate increase sales volume for Rolls Royce (at the time the current Bentley Continental R was an ultra-exclusive £180,000 in the UK, within reach of a very select market selling only 2-300 units a year). The Concept Java never made it into production in the form seen in 1994 (although 13 cars were made for the Sultan of Brunei). However the Bentley Continental GT realised the concept of the Java as a more affordable Bentley, manufactured in much larger volumes. Whilst external styling is  different, the dashboard design was clearly influenced by the Java. The vehicle was unveiled in 2003 Geneva Motor Show, followed by Le Mans,Bentley Continental GT to make dynamic debut at Le Mans 2003 Goodwood Festival of Speed,Bentley Le Mans winners and new Continental GT in action at Goodwood 2003 annual Bentley Drivers Club meeting at Silverstone,.Bentley Speed 8 and Continental GT at BDC Silverstone Very importantly, the car differed significantly from the previous Continental R & T models in terms of its concept: although much of the car is hand assembled, it is a mass-produced car made in significantly larger numbers. It is not a coachbuilt car. As a result the price at launch was significantly less than the Continental R (approximately half) and this immediately exposed the car to a much wider and new customer base as a more affordable car. The Continental GT is equipped with a 6.0&nbsp;litre twin-turbocharged W12 engine, which produces a DIN-rated motive power output of  at 6,100&nbsp;rpm, and torque of  at 1,600-6,100&nbsp;rpm.  Torsen-based permanent four-wheel drive is standard.  It will accelerate from  in 4.8&nbsp;seconds, and go on to reach a top speed of . Early models include a choice of 6 body colours (Diamond Black, Burnt Oak, Cypress, Neptune, Spruce, and Umbrian Red), 8 hide colours (Beluga, Burnt Oak, Laurel, Nautic, Portland, Saffron, Savannah, Saddle), 5 veneer types (Burr Oak, Burr Walnut, Dark Stained Walnut, Madrona, Piano Black), 4 carpet and seatbelt colours (Beluga, Burnt Oak, Laurel, Nautic).Latest Continental GT Specification Changes to Bentley Continental GT includes voice activation for in-car telephone in six languages, increased interior trim option with addition of Magnolia hide, carpets and seatbelts that can be matched to either the main or secondary hide colour.

The Flying Spur utilizes most of the technical underpinnings of the Bentley Continental GT, and was introduced to European and North American markets in the summer of 2005.  Together, the Bentley Continental GT and Flying Spur have boosted Bentley's annual production from around 1,000 units in 2003, to 9,200 units in 2006. The Flying Spur has a 6-litre, 12-cylinder engine, configured in a W formation. Unlike a conventional 12-cylinder engine with two banks of six (V-12), the Continental’s 6-litre engine is configured in two banks of VR six cylinders each (2x VR6). This shortens the W-12 engine's length considerably, compared to a two-bank configuration. The W-12 produces , accelerates from 0 to 60&nbsp;mph in 4.9 seconds, and propels the Flying Spur top speed of . One notable aspect of the Continental Flying Spur is its grille.  Made to look like traditional chromed brass mesh, it is a metal-covered plastic-core.  This was fitted as a safety feature; it is designed to break apart upon impact with a pedestrian. It is a limited (400 units worldwide) version of 2007 model year Continental GT Mulliner Driving Specification, commemorating Crewe factory's 60th anniversary.

The roof is produced by Karmann in Osnabrück, Germany. The GTC uses identical powertrain detail as the GT, and can accelerate from  in 5.1&nbsp;seconds.

In early 2007, a Bentley Continental GT Speed equipped with Nokian Hakkapeliitta Sport Utility 5 studded winter tyres and driven by four-time World Rally Champion Juha Kankkunen, broke the World Speed Record on Ice - on the frozen Baltic Sea near Oulu, Finland. It averaged  in both directions on the "flying kilometre", reaching a maximum speed of . The previous record was , achieved with a Bugatti EB110 Supersport. The record-breaking Bentley was largely standard except for a roll-cage, aerodynamic improvements, and low-temperature fuel and calibration. In February 2011, Bentley succeeded in breaking their own land-ice speed record previously set by the Continental GT.
