 Scouting in Connecticut has experienced many organizational changes since 1910. With only eight counties, Connecticut has had 40 Boy Scout Councils since the Scouting movement began in 1910. In 1922, 17 Boy Scout Councils existed in Connecticut, but currently only four exist. The Girl Scouts of the USA has had at least 53 Girl Scout Councils in Connecticut since their program began in 1912. Today there is one, Girl Scouts of Connecticut which assumed operation on October 1, 2007.Topic Galleries - Courant.com  Connecticut has had as many as forty Boy Scouts of America councils since 1910.  Currently five councils exist in Connecticut.  Four Councils (Connecticut Rivers, Connecticut Yankee, Greenwich and Housatonic) are located within the state of Connecticut. The fifth, Narragansett Council in Rhode Island, serves the youth in the community of Pawcatuck, Connecticut. All in all, these Councils serve more than 61,700 boys, young men and women in all facets of the scouting program. They are led by a volunteer group numbering well over 15,000 men and women. 627 young men were awarded their Eagle Badge in 2005. In 2005, Scouts gave the citizens of Connecticut well over 750,000 community service hours, ranging from Eagle Scout projects and Scouting for Food to participating in the National Good Turn for America initiative. The four Connecticut councils operate over  of camp grounds which served over 8,700 boys and girls in Scouting, as well as several more thousands of non-Scouts that use Scout camps throughout the year.Scouting History in Connecticut  Connecticut Rivers Council is the largest of the four Connecticut-based Councils. It serves the youth in 127 communities, covering six and a half of the eight counties in Connecticut and Fishers Island, New York.  Connecticut Yankee Council serves 37 communities which covers half of New Haven county and most of Fairfield counties.  Greenwich Council serves one Connecticut community, the town of Greenwich.  Housatonic Council serves 5 communities in the Naugatuck Valley region.  The Narragansett Council's insignia and shoulder patch list "RI MA CT" as the states in which it operates. The council serves all of Rhode Island and several entire counties in Massachusetts. However, the "CT" portion is limited to the village of Pawcatuck, along the Pawcatuck River that separates Connecticut from Rhode Island. Pawcatuck is in the town of Stonington, whose other units are part of the Connecticut Rivers Council. The Alfred W. Dater Council #078, headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, came about from a name change of Stamford Council in 1938. Alfred W. Dater had served as the first president of the Stamford Council until his death in February 1938. On December 2, 1938, in honor of his 22 years of service to Stamford Council, the council was renamed in his honor. The council grew through the 1940s and in 1947 John Sherman Hoyt donated  of land in Norwalk, Connecticut for use for short-term camping. After that the camp was named Five Mile River Camp. As Scouting celebrated its 40th anniversary in February 1950, the Council joined in by paying its last mortgage payment on Camp Toquam. The Council reported that it was serving 3,269 boys and adults and plans to build their own Scout headquarters in Glenbrook section of Stamford, Connecticut. The building was sponsored by the Union Memorial Church and financed by donations from the Lions Club and by selling a portion of the Five Mile River Camp. The purchase of the Williams Training Center in the late 1950s was made possible by selling the remaining portion of Five Mile River Camp. The Ponus Lodge #521 of the Order of the Arrow was established in 1956. The Council celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1967 with 2,620 registered scouts. In 1971, the Council reported 3,000 registered scouts. The following year, the Boy Scout Councils of Alfred W. Dater, Mauwehu and Pomperaug voted to consolidate their operations into a new Council. In 1972 the Council ceased operations and the new one, Fairfield County Council, began its history. Ponus Lodge #521 was the OA lodge for the Alfred W. Dater Council. Their name comes from the chief of the Rippowam Tribe.  Their lodge totem is a "false face" Iroquois mask in the image of "Hoba Mako" (rough spelling). Founded in 1956, the lodge ceased its operations when it merged with Chief Pomperaug #408 and Mauwehu #389 to form Tankiteke Lodge #313 in 1972. Bridgeport Council #065 was headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Founded in 1915, it changed its name to Pomperaug Council in 1936. Bristol Area Council #066 was headquartered in Bristol, Connecticut. It was founded in 1918 and operated until it merged with Keemosabee Council to form Nathan Hale Council in 1967. Woapalane Lodge #471 was the OA lodge for Bristol Council. Their name translates to "bald eagle" which is also their lodge totem. The lodge was founded in 1952 and ceased operations in 1967 when it merged with Keemosahbee #234 to form Wihungen #234. The camp was founded in 1928 by the Bristol Area Council. It was sold after the New Britain Area Council and the Bristol Area Councils were merged into what was then called Nathan Hale Council in 1972. The new Council changed the name of New Britain's Camp Keemosabee into Camp Nahaco. 1n 1980?, a program pavilion at Camp Nahaco was enclosed and insulated. This winter shelter was dedicated in the name of Camp Cochipianee. It shares the parade field with another winter shelter named after the former Camp Keemosabee. Central Connecticut Council #071 had its headquarters in Meriden, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Meriden Council in 1929. The Council encompassed the towns of Meriden, Wallingford, and Southington. It ceased to operate in 1978, when it was absorbed by Quinnipiac Council. It owned Camp Terramuggus.  The Council also owned Deer Lake Scout Reservation, which is operated now by Connecticut Yankee Council. Wangunks Lodge #274 was the OA lodge for the Central Connecticut Council. Their name translates to "bend in the river" in the Algonquian language. Their lodge totem is an American eagle. The lodge was absorbed into Arcoon Lodge #369 in 1978. Central Fairfield Council #075 was headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Norwalk Council in 1933. Charter Oak Council #070, was headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Hartford Council in 1933. In 1972, the Council ceased to exist when it merged with Mattatuck, Middlesex County, Nathan Hale and Tunxis to form Long Rivers Council. Wipunquoak Lodge #558 was the OA lodge for the Charter Oak Council. Their name translates to "white oak" (Lenape). Their lodge totem is the Charter Oak. The lodge was founded in 1964 and ceased operation when it merged with Kiethan #59, Mattatuck #217, Wihungen #234 and Tunxis #491 to form Eluwak #59 in 1973. The Lake of Isles Scout Reservation (LOISR) was developed by the Charter Oak Council and had its first summer camp season in 1960, the Jubilee Year of the Boy Scouts of America. The plan was to develop four camps on the more than  that surrounded Lake of Isles, located in North Stonington, Ledyard and Preston townships of rural southeastern Connecticut. For 1960, Camps Pequot and Apache had been the only ones built. A third camp, Camp Cherokee, opened in 1970. This camp was designated an "Explorer Base" (although the Boy Scouting program was the only program that really used the camp as the Exploring program underwent drastic changes by the early 70s) and featured patrol cooking with a central commissary. The fourth camp never got beyond the planning stage. The Charter Oak Council merged with four other Councils in 1972 to form Long Rivers Council. By the mid-1970s, with a declining Boy Scout-age demographic nationally and declining Boy Scout membership in general due to the expanding list of organizations for adolescent boys, Long Rivers Council was faced with shutting down a number of their camps to the summer camping experience. For instance, Camp Nahaco closed to regular summer camping after 1977 (although it would occasionally re-open for long-term camping with specialty themes such as "Enviro-Camp"). Camp Tadma was closed in 1977, but a couple of years later opened again as a long-term Webelos Camp. The plan for LOISR was to close Camp Pequot for two years and run Camp Apache for two years, then switch the status of the camps for the following two years. They expected this to reduce the impact of a summer camp season on the land by spreading out the wear and tear. So in 1975 and 1976, Camp Pequot was placed in "conservation status", and Camps Apache and Cherokee ran during those two summers. In 1977, Camp Apache was placed in conservation status and Camp Pequot was re-opened. However, for 1979, Long Rivers Council management changed its plan and decided to keep Camps Pequot and Cherokee open permanently.  For 1981, Camp Cherokee's patrol cooking operation was moved to Camp Pequot, as an option for troops who preferred this. Thus, while still a reservation of multiple camps, by the 22nd year of operation of LOISR, only Camp Pequot remained as a summer camp. The summer camp season also shortened as time went on. In the 1960s, both Pequot and Apache opened for eight weeks of summer camp use. By the mid-1970s, this was down to six weeks for Camp Apache. By the late seventies, Camp Pequot was only open for summer camping three weeks out of the summer. With the closure of Camp Cherokee after the 1980 season, Camp Pequot's season expanded back to five weeks. With the construction of the Mashantucket Pequot Casino in 1991â€“1992, the natural beauty and surroundings had been damaged enough to make Long Rivers Council consider selling the property to the Native American tribe and this was done in 1992. The Mashantucket nation has since converted the land into a golf course. Camp Apache had the largest capacity of the three camps, serving as many as 400 scouts a week at its height in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It had a large dining hall and a huge reservation chapel. It also was closest to the reservation entrance on the western shores of Lake of Isles. The Reservation Family Housing (on "Knob Hill") and the Reservation Health Lodge were also located in Camp Apache. In 1975 and 1976, Camp Apache ran for the last time during two summer seasons. In 1977, it was placed in conservation status and was never opened again as a Boy Scout Camp. Occasionally, it was rented by other groups and Scouts would continue to use Camp Apache for short-term Camporees and other district events. However, the reservation itself was not within the geographic boundary of Long Rivers Council, making other Council camps closer to the Council membership. Thus, Camp Apache was never used as much as it could have been. Camp Pequot was the southernmost camp on the reservation. It was mainly flat along the shoreline with a rapid rise of hills on the western side of the camp. It had a dining hall which served as many as 350 Scouts a week during the camp's heyday in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was only slightly smaller than Camp Apache. The camp had an outdoor basketball court, which was rather unusual for most camps. Originally, the camp had eight summer campsites. Down on the flat, it included Buccaneers, Aquanauts, Mohegan, Woodsmen and Rocky Trails. The "higher elevation" campsites included Stockade, Bailey Hill and Hickory Hill. Later, Blueberry Hill was developed. Even later, the staff's central campsite, near the dining hall, was converted to a campsite called Braves, with the staff lodging being dispersed so that they lived near their program areas. The Braves campsite was mainly used for boys who wanted to come to camp, but no adult leader from their troop could. The camp staff would "provide" the adult leadership and thus the campsite was for what was known as the "provisional" troop. In the mid-1970s, the plan for LOISR was to close Camp Pequot for two years and run Camp Apache for two years, then switch the status of the camps for the following two years. So in 1975 and 1976, Camp Pequot was placed in "conservation status" and Camps Apache and Cherokee ran during those two summers. In 1977, Camp Apache was placed in conservation status, and Camp Pequot was re-opened. However, for 1979, Long Rivers Council management changed its plan and decided to keep Camps Pequot and Cherokee open permanently. By 1981, Camp Cherokee's patrol cooking operation was moved to Camp Pequot, as an option for troops who preferred this. Thus, while still a reservation of multiple camps, only Camp Pequot remained as a summer camp. The summer camp season also shortened as time went on. In the 1960s, Pequot opened for eight weeks of summer camp use, which was reduced by the end of the 1970s to only three weeks. However, with the closure of Camp Cherokee after the 1980 season, Camp Pequot's season expanded back to five weeks. Camp Cherokee opened in 1970. This camp was designated an "Explorer Base" at first and featured patrol cooking with a central commissary. However, the designation as an Explorer Base quickly disappeared, as Exploring became more vocationally oriented in the early 1970s, especially in Connecticut with its Police Explorer Posts. Camp Cherokee was the only camp opened on the eastern shores of Lake of Isles, which had been formed by damming a small stream. The original channel ran through the Camp Cherokee waterfront, making the drop-off between the non-swimmers' area and the beginners' area huge. At Camp Cherokee, campsites were further subdivided into patrol sites. Each patrol site had a shepherders stove and wall tents on wooden platforms with bunks and mattresses provided. Scouts would have to make the trek to the commissary three times a day to pick up food for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and then cook it themselves. This was the logical camp in the Council to hold Youth Leader Training, whether it was called JLTC, TLD or TLTC, as it had the patrol cooking arrangements. There were six troop sites throughout Camp Cherokee's history: Sassafrass Hill, Timbertrails, Haven, Wilderness, Tunxis and Pyquag. Camp Cherokee had all the usual program features for Scouting: a nature area, a waterfront, a place to practice scoutcraft, a rifle range and an archery range. The lower part of the camp, along the Lake of Isles shoreline, included the campsite Tunxis, the nature area and the waterfront. It was a steep climb up to the rest of the camp, which included the trading post/camp office and commissary and the other five campsites. Some needed amenities were provided at the Reservation level, such as a health lodge and lodging for families of married staff. From 1970 until 1978, Camp Cherokee was open the same weeks as the other camps, which allowed some friendly competition between camps on opposite sides of the lake, reaching from softball games to a tug of war. Most popular was a battle between "war canoes", where two 12-plus person canoes, representing each camp, headed out on the lake, determined to swamp each other by splashing water into the opponents' canoe. Another favorite activity was to out-shout the other camp during campwide campfires on Sunday evening and Friday evening. In 1979 and 1980, with continuing declining attendance, Camp Cherokee was open for only three weeks, followed by Camp Pequot for the next three weeks. This allowed the same staff to be hired for both camps. By 1981, Camp Cherokee's patrol cooking operation was moved to Camp Pequot. Thus, despite being the most modern facility on the Reservation, Camp Cherokee was closed for good as a Boy Scout summer camp. The headquarters of Derby Council #069 was in Derby, Connecticut. The first Scout troop, Troop 1, was formed in Derby in 1911. Derby Council was formed in 1918 as a Second Class Council. The Council changed its name to Housatonic Council in 1923 when it became a First Class Council (see above). Eastern Connecticut Council #076, was headquartered in Norwich, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of North New London Council in 1929. The Council ceased operations when it merged with Pequot Council to create the Indian Trails Council in 1971. Uncas Lodge #297 was the OA lodge for the Eastern Connecticut Council. Their name comes from the son of Chigachgook. Their totem is a fox. The lodge ceased its operation with its merger with Samson Occum #338 to form Sassacus Lodge #10. This camp was operated by the Eastern Connecticut Council from 1943 to 1963. It was sold and the operation was moved to the much larger June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation in 1964. Headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, Fairfield County Council #068 was created in 1972 with the merger of three Councils:  Mauwehu, Pomperaug and Alfred W. Dater. The Council ceased operations when it later merged with Quinnipiac Council to form Connecticut Yankee Council in 1998. The camp was located in Sherman. It was owned by the Fairfield County Council and home of Tankiteke OA lodge.  Its original name was Camp Mauwehu and was the Mauwehu Council's summer camp. Located on the shores of Candlewood Lake, Camp Aquila was sold off by the council in 1984; once the center of Fairfield County Council's outdoor program, it is now home to a small number of residences. Tankiteke Lodge 313 was the OA lodge of Fairfield County Council. Their name translates to "those of slight stature." Their lodge totem is a hoop of the universe. The lodge was created 1973 with the merger of Mauwehu Lodge #389, Chief Pomperaug Lodge #408 and Ponus Lodge #521. In July 1972 the acting Area Chief, Jim Wardwell, brought the four lodges whose councils were to be merged in order to discuss how to merger the vibrant lodges into one (Achewon Netopalis Lodge #427 withdrew when its council decided not to be part of the merger). After several months of discussion, the three lodges held a tri-lodge dinner in December 1972. The membership voted on a new name, new lodge totem, new lodge constitution, new lodge by-laws and its first set of lodge officers. The new lodge was chartered in January 1973. There were originally five chapters, corresponding to the six council districts: Owenoke (Stamford district), Pequot (Nutmeg District), Saganaw (Sachem and Oronoque districts), Sasqua (Sasqua district) and Scatacook (Scatacook district). In 1980, Sasqua and Owenoke chapters were merged to form Powahay chapter. A dance team was formed in the Owenoke chapter and performed for local Scouting units, local lodges and appeared on local television report. The group won several competitions at annual section conclaves. The lodge was also very active in section leadership, having been home to the first NE-1E Conclave Chief in 1974, and to the 1985 NE-1E Section Chief, Steve Burns of Danbury, who was elected after Steve Mimnaugh of Eluwak 59 was elected the 1985 National Chief. In one era in particular the lodge was home to several Section Chiefs in sequence, beginning in 1988 with Dave Turechek of Trumbull, then George Oldroyd of Bridgeport, Sean Oldroyd, also of Bridgeport (who was elected two years in succession), and then Pat Sullivan of Trumbull who served multiple terms. (The Oldroyd brothers were thought to have been the first brothers to serve back-to-back terms as Section Chief in the Order's history, and it is noteworthy that the Pinnavia brothers of Shu-Shu-Gah Lodge 24, who also served as Section Chiefs several years later, belonged to the same section, NE-3A.) Sean Oldroyd was elected Northeast Region Chief in 1991. To commemorate this milestone, Tankiteke Lodge produced a special two-per-life lodge flap bearing the legend "HOME OF THE NORTHEAST REGION CHIEF". In 1994, Oldroyd became the lodge's first recipient of the Distinguished Service Award. Oldroyd was presented the DSA by Tom Reddin, his former Region Chairman. Pat Sullivan also received the DSA in 1996. The lodge merged with Arcoon Lodge 369 to form Owaneco Lodge 313 in 1999. Hartford Council #070 was headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut. It was founded in 1915 and changed its name to Charter Oak Council in 1933. Indian Trails Council #073, headquartered in Norwich, Connecticut, was formed with the merger of the Pequot Council and the Eastern Connecticut Council in October 1971. The Council owned several camps during its existence: Camp Wakenah (sold in 2004), Cochegan Rock (sold in 2006 to the Mohegan Tribe), Camp Quinebaug (sold in 1965) as well as June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation. The Council's Order of the Arrow Lodge was the Sassacus Lodge #10. The districts were Quinebaug, Natchaug, Mohegan and Pequot. On January 1, 1995, the Indian Trails Council (Norwich) merged with the Long Rivers Council (Hartford) to form the Connecticut Rivers Council #66 (East Hartford). In its history, three Scout Executives served Indian Trails Council. These were J. Lawrence Deveau (1971â€“1975), Anthony Booth (1976â€“1984) and Lawrence V. Pegg (1985â€“1995). Sassacus Lodge #10 was the OA lodge of the Indian Trails Council. Their name is derived from Sassacus who was a Pequot Chieftain. Their totem is a war club. The lodge was created by the merger of Uncas #297 and Samson Occum #388 in 1971. The lodge received its first charter under its new name on January 1, 1972, and ceased operation in 1995 when it merged with Eluwak #59 to form Tschitani #10. In the fall of 1995, a joint lodge conclave with Eluwak #59 was held at June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation in Ashford. This was the last event that Sassacus Lodge #10 held. On September 17, 1995, the membership of both lodges voted for a new lodge name, totem, by-laws and slate of officers. Keemosahbee Council #073, was headquartered in New Britain, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of New Britain Council in 1953. In 1967, the Council merged with the Bristol Council to form the Nathan Hale Council. Keemosahbee Lodge #234 was the OA lodge for the New Britain Council (1943â€“1953) until the Council changed its name to Keemosahbee Council. The totem is a winged teal. The lodge was founded in 1943 and ceased operations when it merged with Woapalane #471 to form Wihungen #234. Camp Keemosahbee strattles the Eastford/Woodstock line on Crystal Lake. It was operated by the Keemosahbee Council in 1916, which served the New Britain area, until the Council merged to become the Nathan Hale Council in 1967. It operated under the Keemosahbee name until it was renamed Nahaco to reflect the new Council (Nathan Hale Council). The three combinations of the camp's name and Council are represented in the main dining hall as enlarged wooden versions of the camp patches. Other amenities, such as the camp's chapel and one of three winter shelters, reflect its original Keemosabee name. The camp distinguishes itself from others in Connecticut by using permanent Klondike-style shelters in lieu of the more common canvas platform tents. After a series of Council mergers, the camp came into the ownership of the Connecticut Rivers Council, which hosted a Junior Leader Training Camp and a water sports merit badge camp at the site until it was sold in 2003 to the towns of Eastford and Woodstock.  The towns have permanently preserved  of the camp's sparsely delevoped woodlands for hiking and camping, while maintaining the remaining land along Crystal Lake (including the camp center, sports field, dining hall and other camp buildings) for rental, picnicking and sports use. The Camp Nahaco Commission, which operates the camp on behalf of the two towns, also hosts a day camp program for area children. According to the town of Eastford website, the commission is dedicated to maintaining Camp "Nahaco and its facilities" and "preserving the natural beauty [that] Camp Nahaco affords". Also see Woodstock Conservation Commission for further information about the camp's preservation and Eastford Recreation Page for policy information on use of Nahaco's facilities. Long Rivers Council #066 was headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut. The Council was formed in 1972 with the merger of five councils (Charter Oak, Mattatuck, Middlesex County, Nathan Hale and Tunxis). The Council then merged with Indian Trails Council in 1995 to create the Connecticut Rivers Council. Eluwak Lodge #59 was the OA lodge of Long Rivers Council. Their name translates to "most powerful one" in Lenape. Their totem is five rivers merging. The lodge was created in 1973 from the merger of Kiehtan #59, Mattatuck #217, Wihungen #234, Tunxis #491 and Wipanquoak #558. The lodge ceased its operation in 1995 after merging with Sassacus #10 to form Tschitani #10. Manchester Township Council #068, headquartered in Manchester, Connecticut, was founded in 1917. The Council ceased operations in 1925. Mattatuck Council #080 was headquartered in Waterbury, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Waterbury Council in 1935, when it absorbed Naugatuck Council. In 1972, the Council ceased to exist when it merged with Charter Oak, Middlesex County, Nathan Hale and Tunxis to form Long Rivers Council. Mattatuck Lodge #217 was the OA lodge for Mattatuck Council. Their name, from an Algonquian language, is translated as "land of few trees". The lodge totem is an arrowhead with crossed arrows. The lodge was founded in 1942 and ceased operations in 1973 with the merger of Kiehtan #59, Wihungen #234, Tunxis #491 and Wipunquoak #558 to form Eluwak #59. Camp Mattatuck is located in Plymouth, Connecticut. Mattatuck Council purchased  in 1938 and the camp opened the following year. The original  included wooded areas, open fields and Lake Kenosha. The first campsites were built overlooking the lake on the west. Additional properties were purchased to comprise the  camp today. Camp Mattatuck offers a wide range of activities for the Scouts including mountain biking, rock climbing, sail boating, canoeing, kayaking, rifle and shotgun shooting, swimming and lifesaving. The camp is used to host a Cub Scout Day Camp and the resident Boy Scout camp and serves about 1,000 boy scouts and 500 cub scouts each summer. Six cabins on the camp grounds also allow for winter camping. The headquarters of Mauwehu Council #075 was in Ridgefield, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Mid Fairfield Council in 1952. In 1972 the Boy Scout Councils of Alfred W. Dater, Mauwehu and Pomperaug voted to consolidate their operations into a new Council and the Council ceased operations and the new one, Fairfield County Council, began its history.[6] Mauwehu Lodge #389 was the OA lodge for the Mauwehu Council. Their name comes from a chief of a local Native American tribe.  Their totem was the gray wolf. The lodge was founded in 1948 and ceased its operations when it merged with Chief Pomperaug #408 and Ponus #521 to form Tankiteke Lodge #313 in 1972. Camp Mauwehu was the summer camp for the council.TopoZone - Camp Mauwehu, USGS New Milford (CT) Topo Map The camp was built in Ridgefield on land donated by Jerry Tuccio on Pine Mountain Road.http://acorn-online.net/acornonline/S-Z.htm About  in New Canaan off of Valley Road, had a pond. Meriden Council #071, was headquartered in Meriden, Connecticut. Founded in 1915, it changed its name to Central Connecticut Council in 1929. Mid Fairfield Council #075 had its headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Central Fairfield Council in 1935. Middlesex County Council #674, headquartered in Middletown, Connecticut, was founded in 1924 and ceased its operation when the Council merged with four other Councils (Charter Oak, Mattatuck, Nathan Hale and Tunxis) to form Long Rivers Council in 1972. Three camps belonged to Middlesex County Council, which were White Mountain Camp, Camp Kiehtan (which was at various locations in the 1930s and 1940) and Camp Tadma (which was also known as the Mark Greer Scout Reservation; 1947â€“1972). Wahquimacut Lodge #59 was the OA lodge for Middlesex County Council. Their lodge totem was a pine tree. The lodge was founded in 1931, but disbanded for a number of years before re-chartering in 1957 as Kiehtan #59. Kiehtan Lodge #59 was the OA lodge for Middlesex County Council. Their name translates to "spirit of the southwest" in Natick. Their totem is of a Native American feeding a beaver. The lodge was founded in 1931 as Wahquimacut, but disbanded for a number of years before re-chartering in 1957 as Kiehtan. In 1972, the lodge merged with Mattatuck #217, Wihungen #234, Tunxis #491 and Wipanquoak #558 to form Eluwak #59. After World War II, the Council looked to build a permanent camp for its troops.  Land surrounding Tadma pond was for sale, and was purchased. The camp was developed enough to have a summer season in 1947. With five camp sites, a small dining hall, waterfront, health lodge, chapel, shower house and rifle range, it had all the amenities of a typical Scout camp of the time.  Mark Greer was a major benefactor of the Middlesex County Council, and the planned reservation was named in his honor. After the major merger of five councils to form the Long Rivers Council, the plans for additional camps on the undeveloped east side were scrapped.  Camp Tadma's last season as a Scout camp was 1976.  It re-opened as a Webelos long-term camp (one of the first in the country) in 1978.  It continues as a Webelos camp and as a Cub Day Camp with the move of Camp Wakenah to the Mark Greer Scout Reservation property in 2004. The summer camp closed after the 2012 season and was sold in 2015 to a local church. Nathan Hale Council #072 was headquartered in New Britain, Connecticut. The Council came about from a merger of Bristol Council and Keemosahbee Council in 1967. The Council merged with four other councils (Charter Oak, Mattatuck, Middlesex County and Tunxis) to form Long Rivers Council in 1972. Wihungen Lodge #234 was the OA lodge for the Nathan Hale Council. Their name means "to sacrifice." The lodge totem is a Grand Union flag. The lodge was created from the merger of Keemosahbee #234 and Woapalane #471 in 1968. The lodge ceased its operation in 1973 with its merger of Kiehtan #59, Mattatuck #217, Tunxis #491 and Wipunquoak #558 to from Eluwak #59. The camp was founded in 1916 as Camp Keemosabee by the New Britain Area Council. Located on Weeks Road on the banks of Crystal Pond, in both Eastford and Woodstock, Connecticut, the  camp was the Scout camp for four different Councils over its long history: originally New Britain Area Council, then Nathan Hale Council, Long Rivers Council and finally Connecticut Rivers Council. A feature most remembered of the camp is its lagoon, separated from the rest of Crystal Pond by the Causeway (bridge) and the points of the Scout Law painted on the steps at the beach that lead to the swimming area. The merge of two former councils (the New Britain Area Council and the Bristol Area Council) into the Nathan Hale Council in 1968 come up with the amalgomy of Camp NAthan HAle COuncil&nbsp;â€” NA-HA-CO : NAHACO. The entrance gate truss pattern spells out NAHACO. By 1972, the Nathan Hale Council became Nathan Hale District, but the camp still enjoyed keeping the name Nahaco in the newly formed Long Rivers Council. A program pavilion was soon converted to a winter shelter that bears the name of Keemosabee. In 1981, another program pavilion that shares the parade field with the Keemosabe Shelter, was converted to a winter shelter and named in honor of Camp Cochipianee, which had been sold by the new Long Rivers Council. In the 1990s, the Highland District's fundraising put a lot of time and money into Nahaco, with improvements of updating the Dining Hall kitchen with all new stainless steel. It was then when the third and final program activity pavilion was converted into a winter shelter, then named the Highland Shelter. The deteriorated camp office was razed at that time as well. Nahaco saw its last year as a full summer camp facility in 1977. Although several Specialty Camp weeks have been run at the camp since 1977, it never regained its full-time summer camp use. It always was a favorite place for winter camping up until the mid-2000s. A referendum vote was held by the towns of Woodstock and Eastford about the purchase of Camp Nahaco from Connecticut Rivers Council. The referendum, held on October 16, 2002, approved the plan and on March 3, 2003, the camp became town property. The two towns shared the $560,000.00 purchase price. Today,  are now permanently protected from development and the Boy Scouts still have use of the property. Please see Camp Keemosabee (a previous name) for additional information. Naugatuck Council #072 was headquartered in Naugatuck, Connecticut. Founded in 1917, the Council ceased operations when it was merged with Waterbury Council to form the Mattatuck Council in 1935. New Britain Council #073, headquartered in New Britain, Connecticut, was founded in 1916 and changed its name to Keemosahbee Council in 1953. It owned Camp Heinzman. The headquarters of New Haven Council #074 is in New Haven. With the Scouting movement starting in 1910, the New Haven Register reported on August 21, 1910, that the Lion and the Arrow Patrols were forming. New Haven Mayor Frank Rice, City Librarian Willis Stetson and Judge Albert McClellan Matthewson strongly supported the Scouting movement and in 1912 founded the New Haven Council of the Boy Scouts of America. In 1913, the council was reorganized as a Second Class Council. Two years later, in 1915, the Council was incorporated as a First Class Council and hired Gilbert N. Jerome as the first Scout Executive. In 1929 the Council changed its name to Southern New Haven County Council. New London Council #077 was headquartered in New London, Connecticut. Founded in 1918, the name was changed to South New London County in 1923. In 1929, the name was changed back to New London Council and remained until a name change in 1935 to Pequot Council. North New London Council #076 was headquartered in Norwich, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Norwich Council in 1922 and changed its name again to Eastern Connecticut Council in 1929. Northern Litchfield Council #079 was headquartered in Torrington, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Torrington Council in 1929.

Camp Cochegan, also known as Cochegan Rock and Becker Memorial Scout Reservation, was a  camp that was donated to the Pequot Council in 1963 by the family of Nathan and Ida Becker. The reservation has also been operated by the Indian Trails Council and most recently by the Connecticut Rivers Council. Cochegan Rock is believed to be the largest freestanding boulder in New England,  long,  high and  wide. It weighs 10,000 tons. The property has been transferred to the Mohegan tribe in exchange for a $1,000,000 contribution to the Councilâ€™s Capital Campaign. Tribal officials consider the rock an important piece of their heritage. 350 years ago, chief Uncas, who founded the Mohegan tribe and made peace with the colonists, may have held tribal councils there. Samson Occum Lodge #388 was the OA lodge for the Pequot Council. Their name comes from Samson Occom, a Mohegan Indian and an ordained Presbyterian minister. Their totem is a profile of a Mohegan Native American with a single feather. Camp Wakenah is the Boy Scouts of America's second oldest camp (however, the source of this claim is questioned). It was founded in around 1917 on Gardner Lake in Salem, Connecticut. The property was sold in the 1930s to buy the second Camp Wakenah at a different location on Gardner Lake which consisted of . In 1971, the Pequot Council (New London) merged with the Eastern Connecticut Council (Norwich) into the Indian Trails Council which had its office in New London. 1972 was the last resident camp season for Camp Wakenah. Despite the loss of the resident program, Wakenah was still used by troops for weekend camping and district events. The location was also used for a four-week cub scout day camp program. Connecticut Rivers Council sold the property in 2004. Some in the area resented the sale for private use after the Council had originally planned to sell the property to the town of Salem for $500,000.00. A bidding war resulted in the final $1,000,000.00 selling price. The day camp program was moved to Camp Wakenah's new site in the Mark Greer Scout Reservation in Bozrah. The new site was located west of Camp Tadma on the common property, separated by the parking lot. Its parade field was near the top of the pine covered hill to the right of the property's main entrance. The parade field sat in a clearing that was originally made as a campsite. It was expanded to make room for a BB and Archery range for the day camp. Camp Wakenah "III" also made use of a newly constructed modular home that served as its administrative building and the existing Tadma Fort. In 2009, Camp Wakenah expanded to encompass several other aspects of Camp Tadma, such as use of the newly constructed parade field, the dining hall for lunch, and the new Sherwood Forest areaâ€”in what had been the day camp parade field.  In 2010, Camp Tadma and Camp Wakenah operate simultaneously, and use the same facilities, although programs are developed to maintain age-appropriateness. Pomperaug Council #065, was headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Bridgeport Council in 1936. In 1972 the Boy Scout Councils of Alfred W. Dater, Mauwehu and Pomperaug voted to consolidate their operations into a new Council and the Council ceased operations and the new one, Fairfield County Council, began its history.[6] The Council owned Camp Scoutland.

Quinnipiac Council #074, was headquartered in New Haven until 1961, when it moved to Hamden, CT. The Council came about from a name change of Southern New Haven County Council in 1935. The name Quinnipiac comes from the Native American tribe which occupied the area. Originally formed in 1912 as the New Haven Council of the Boy Scouts of America, its headquarters was located in New Haven. After years of growth and expanding outside the boundaries of New Haven, the Council name was changed to Southern New Haven County Council in 1929. In 1935, the Council name was changed again to Quinnipiac Council. The Council absorbed the Central Connecticut Council in 1978. In 1997, the Council voted to merge with Fairfield County Council. After 85 years in existence, the Council ceased its operation on January 1, 1998, and became part of the Connecticut Yankee Council. The Council is most notable for its operation, which was a model for the rest of country. In 1943, Elbert K. Fretwell, Chief Scout Executive of the BSA, described Quinnipiac Council as an example to councils all over America for the high quality of the Scouting program being provided. Camp Sequassen was rated a double-A camp. In 1962, the Council hosted the first of many successful International Camporees. On July 4, 1962, Scouts from 14 countries assembled at Camp Sequassen. During its existence, the Quinnipiac Council owned the follow camps: Camp Sequassen, New Hartford, Connecticut, Deer Lake Scout Reservation, Killingworth, Connecticut, Old Settlers Scout Reservation, Milford, Connecticut, and Wah Wah Tayysee Scout Reservation, Hamden, Connecticut. This council was served by Arcoon Lodge #369 of the Order of the Arrow. Chi Sigma Lodge #369 was the original OA lodge for Quinnipiac Council. Chi Sigma started in the Quinnipiac Council in 1934 as a Scout Camp Honor Society. There was never a totem developed for the lodge. When the Boy Scouts of America began encouraging local councils to switch from their honor societies to the Order of the Arrow, the membership voted to organize Chi Sigma Lodge in 1947.  The lodge was assigned the number 369 on November 19, 1947. On Monday evening, December 29, a formal installation of the lodge was held at the Council offices. The name Chi Sigma was retained rather than a Native American name in honor of Sam Bogan, founder of the earlier organization. However, in 1951, the lodge changed its name to Arcoon.  Arcoon Lodge #369 was the OA lodge for Quinnipiac Council. The lodge was formerly known as Chi Sigma, when it changed its name in 1953. The name Arcoon means to "raccoon" in Algonquin. Their totem was a raccoon with a feather.Quirk, Edward J. (1976) Arcoon Lodge History: Silver Anniversary 1951â€“1976 Eager to learn more about what the Order of the Arrow was and how it could better serve the Scouts of the Council, lodge leadership attended an area meeting at Camp Collier in New Hampshire in 1951. Brothers from area lodges were exchanging patches with their lodge totems on them. A committee was formed in 1951 to look for an appropriate symbol for the new lodge. Many animals of the north eastern woods were considered for a totem. A selection committee finally came up with the suggestion that the raccoon be used. All agreed as the pesky raccoon was a friend to all campers at Camp Sequassen, being a frequent visitor to camp sites and food boxes.  Having chosen an appropriate animal as a totem for the lodge, the committee turned to finding a new name, which was supposed to be symbolic of the Native American background of the Order of the Arrow. After careful research the word "Arcoon" was recommended. The committee voted to accept both new name for the lodge and the raccoon as its totem. A contest was set up for a patch design that would best represent the new totem. With the lodge having a new name and totem, application was made to the National Order of the Arrow Secretary for a name change. Final approval was received in late 1951. Chi Sigma Lodge was officially renamed Arcoon Lodge #369. In 1977, Quinnipiac Council absorbed the operations of Central Connecticut Council. Their lodge, Wangunks Lodge #274 was also absorbed in the operations of Arcoon Lodge #369 and became a chapter. Arcoon Lodge received numerous awards and recognition for its dance team during its history. The lodge received National Standard Lodge status numerous times, as well as garnering the E. Urner Goodman Camping Award in 1978. Many Lodge Offices went on to serve on Section Committees and Section Offices. In 1998, Quinnipiac Council and Fairfield County Council voted to merge the two Councils to create the Connecticut Yankee Council.  Arcoon Lodge #369 was merged with Tankiteke Lodge #313 to form Owaneco Lodge #313 of the Connecticut Yankee Council in 1999. In 1955, Mrs. Garland sold  of land in Milford, Connecticut to the Quinnipiac Council. The camp was used for short-term camping and Cub Scout day camp. The Boy Scouts sold the property in the 1980s to be developed for business.  The sale was mainly due to the local Council needing cash to maintain other camps that were in disrepair. South New London County Council #077 was headquartered in New London, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change to New London Council in 1923. In 1929, the Council name was changed back to New London Council.

An article in the Stamford Advocate from 1941 (Tercentenary Edition) stated that on March 22, 1912, the city's first Boy Scout Troop was being formed at the St. John's Episcopal Church. It was called Troop 5. By 1918, unofficial Wolf Cub packs appeared in Stamford. As with most early Boy Scout Councils, they usually formed after local organizations started organizing Scout troops. Local citizens met on March 23, 1917, to discuss Scouting in both Stamford, Connecticut and Darien, Connecticut. In June, their application to the Boy Scouts of America was accepted and the Stamford Council was born. The Council opened its first camp on property in Long Ridge during the summer of 1920. In 1922, the council camp, now named Camp Toquam, was located in Hunting Ridge on Holly's Pond and moved two years later to property in Ridgefield, Connecticut. The Council became incorporated on March 6, 1924. During 1926 and 1927, plans were developed to buy property for a larger camp ground. Camp Toquam opened its 1928 season on the shores of Dog Pond in Goshen, Connecticut. In 1937, Alfred W. Dater died. Dater was council president from the first day and was instrumental in the organization of Boy Scouts in Stamford, Connecticut.

Camp Candlewood is located on the shores of Lake Candlewood in New Fairfield, Connecticut. The  property was purchased in 1959 by the Girl Scout Council of Southwestern Connecticut. The newly formed Council was eager to obtain a camp area that provided a waterfront. Lake Candlewood was created in 1932 by the Connecticut Light and Power Company as a power reservoir. The Council brought in the Girl Scout National Camp Consultants and it was decided to develop both a Day Camp and a Resident Camp at the site. Because the Council had lost its day camp program at Camp Fairlee to an industrial development in Danbury, Connecticut, it was decided to develop the site for a new day camp program. A road to the beach was bulldozed and the Candleberry Shelter was built prior to the opening of Day Camp in 1960. In 1961, the Development Committee started on the Resident Camp. The first building was the Shelter (Yar-Sloop) and in 1962 Seniors camped in Round-up tents at what is now known as "Quite a Hill!" 1963 saw the infirmary building.
