   Sarah Michelle Prinze (née Gellar; born April 14, 1977) is an American actress, producer and entrepreneur. After being spotted by an agent at the age of four in New York City, she made her acting debut in the made-for-TV movie An Invasion of Privacy (1983). Gellar went on to appear in episodes of Spenser: For Hire and Crossbow and have small roles in films such as Funny Farm (1988) and High Stakes (1989). Her first leading part was in the 1992 miniseries Swans Crossing, for which she was nominated for two Young Artist Awards. Gellar's television breakthrough came in 1993, when she originated the role of Kendall Hart on the ABC daytime soap opera All My Children, winning the 1995 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series. Gellar received worldwide recognition for her portrayal of Buffy Summers on the WB TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003), which earned her six Teen Choice Awards, the Saturn Award for Best Genre Television Actress and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. The character was widely popular during the airing of the show and became recognized as one of the 100 greatest female characters in U.S. television. Gellar also gained recognition for horror films like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream 2. She eventually played Kathryn Merteuil in Cruel Intentions (1999) and appeared as Daphne Blake in Scooby-Doo (2002), her biggest live-action commercial success. In 2004, Gellar starred in two box office hits, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed and The Grudge, and subsequently appeared in the sequel,  The Grudge 2 (2006). She then focused on smaller-scale films, such as Southland Tales (2007), The Air I Breathe (2008) and Veronika Decides to Die (2009). She starred in the television drama series Ringer, which ran for one season from 2011 to 2012 and in the CBS sitcom The Crazy Ones with Robin Williams from 2013 to 2014. In 2015, she joined the cast of the animated series Star Wars Rebels for season two, playing a character known as the Seventh Sister. In October 2015, Gellar co-founded Foodstirs,https://foodstirs.com/about/our-story a foodcrafting brand and e-commerce startup selling baking kits for kids.http://greatideas.people.com/2015/09/08/sarah-michelle-gellar-food-brand-foodstirs/http://www.inc.com/lindsay-blakely/sarah-michelle-gellar-startup-foodstirs.html Gellar was born in New York City, New York. She is the only child of Rosellen (Greenfield), a nursery school teacher, and Arthur Gellar, a garment worker. Both of her parents were Jewish, though Gellar's family had a Christmas tree during her childhood holidays. In 1984, when she was seven, her parents divorced and she was raised by her mother on the city's Upper East Side. While Gellar grew up with her mother, she lost contact with her father, from whom she remained estranged until his death in 2001; she once described him as "non-existent", and has remarked: "My father, you can just say, is not in the picture. I'm not being deliberately evasive about him, it's just that there's so little to say. He is not a person who exists in my life. Just because you donate sperm does not make you a father. I don't have a father. I would never give him the credit to acknowledge him as my father." Besides being a working child at the time, Gellar was a competitive figure skater, finishing in third place at the New York State regional competition. She also placed fourth at a Tae Kwon Do competition at Madison Square Garden (she was a black belt). Gellar was given a partial scholarship to study at the Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School, as her mother was not able to pay full tuition, for which she was constantly bullied. She said in an interview with The Independent: "I was different and that's the one thing you can't be at school, because you're ostracised. I didn't have the money these kids had". Gellar was not present in class for most of the time at the school as she had to work in several acting projects simultaneously, recalling that she "had more absences in the first month than you're supposed to have for an entire year. I was telling them that I had back problems and had to go to the doctor the whole time". Gellar then briefly attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, but dropped out due to acting obligations; the teachers threatened to fail her because of her constant absence from classes as she was busy going to auditions, despite earning good grades. Gellar graduated from the Professional Children's School, in 1994 as a straight-A student with a 4.0 grade average.http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001264/bio As Gellar spent significant time working on All My Children while "trying to graduate", the majority of her senior year was completed through guided study. At four, she was spotted by an agent in a restaurant in Upper Manhattan. Two weeks later, she auditioned for a part in An Invasion of Privacy, a television film starring Valerie Harper, Carol Kane, and Jeff Daniels. At the audition, Gellar read both her own lines and those of Harper, impressing the directors enough to cast her in the role. She subsequently appeared in a controversial television commercial for Burger King, in which her character criticized McDonald's and claimed to eat only at Burger King. The ad led to a lawsuit by McDonald's, naming Gellar and banning her from eating at the food chain; she recalled in a 2004 interview: "I wasn’t allowed to eat there. It was tough because, when you’re a little kid, McDonald’s is where all your friends have their birthday parties, so I missed out on a lot of apple pies." At the age of nine, she appeared alongside Mathew Broderick and Eric Stoltz in the Broadway production The Widow Claire.  While growing up, Gellar also worked as a model for Wilhemina and acted in over 100 television commercials. Gellar played guest-roles in TV series such as Spenser: For Hire and Crossbow,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0760485/ and played supporting characters in the films Funny Farm (1988) and High Stakes (1989). She appeared in the young-teen girl talk show Girl Talk. In 1991, she was cast as a young Jacqueline Bouvier in the TV movie A Woman Named Jackie. Gellar's first major acting work came in the following year, when she landed the starring role in the 1992 syndicated teen serial Swans Crossing, for which she received two Young Artist Award nominations, one for Best Young Actress in a New Television Series and the other for Best Young Actress in an Off-Primetime Series.http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000716/1993 She subsequently made her debut in the soap opera All My Children in 1993, playing Kendall Hart, the long-lost daughter of character Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). As she got the role, Gellar was complimented as having the acting talent and the "forceful personality" needed to go up against Lucci's experience; Kendall was supposed to be like a younger version of Erica. In 1995, at the age of eighteen, she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for the role. The same year, Gellar left All My Children to pursue other acting opportunities. Gellar landed the lead in the 1997 TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, playing a teenager burdened with the responsibility of fighting a number of occult foes, mostly vampires. She was screen tested eleven times, originally auditioning for the role of Cordelia Chase which went to Charisma Carpenter.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/trivia After its premiere, the show along with Gellar's portrayal received critical and popular acclaim. It had seven seasons and 144 episodes, and during its broadcast, the series brought Gellar six Teen Choice Awards, the Saturn Award for Best Genre Television Actress and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Drama.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/awards Gellar sang during the Buffy the Vampire Slayer musical episode "Once More, with Feeling", which spawned an original cast album, released in 2002.Randy Lewis (September 23, 2002). "In The Know; Musical 'Buffy' Finally Lands in Stores", Los Angeles Times. p. F6.Hill, Melinda [ Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Once More with Feeling [Musical Episode Soundtrack]], Allmusic.com. Retrieved on June 29, 2010. During the initial success of Buffy, she made her first major film role in I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), co-starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. She was cast as Helen Shiver, an aspiring beauty actress. The movie received generally mixed reviews, with praise going mostly towards the leads; while Washington Post pointed out Gellar as "likable", UK's The Guardian commented that the main characters were "brilliantly and authentically played by the four actors who were key members of the late 90s brat-pack". The film was successful at the box office, grossing US$125,586,134 around the globe, and earned Gellar a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actress – Horror and a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance. That same year, Gellar got a role in the teen horror Scream 2, in which she portrayed Cici Cooper, a Sorority sister and film fan. She signed on to Scream 2 without having read the script, on the basis of the success of the first film.Wes Craven (September 26, 2000). Behind the 'Scream' documentary from Ultimate Scream Collection (DVD). United States: Dimension Home Video The sequel gained critical acclaim and earned US$172,363,301 worldwide. With her recent work at the time, she cemented her "It girl" status with her first appearance on the 'Most Beautiful' list by People magazine. In 1998, she appeared in one episode of Saturday Night Live and went on to host the show two more times until 2002. She also provided the voice of the Gwendy Doll in Small Soldiers (1998), a commercial success with mixed feedback. She also had a cameo appearance in the romantic comedy She's All That (1999), which was followed by her starring role in Simply Irresistible, a box office bomb widely panned by critics. However, Gellar next saw her profile raised significantly for her role of Kathryn Merteuil, in Cruel Intentions (1999), a modern-day retelling of Les Liaisons dangereuses. The film initially started as an indie project, but when it was released, it became a commercial and mainstream success, grossing US$75 million worldwide on a US$10 million budget. It also earned several awards and nominations,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139134/awards?ref_=tt_awd including the "Best Kiss" award at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards for Gellar and co-star Selma Blair. Her part as a brunette cocaine addict with an appetite for manipulating and using people received mostly positive reviews; critic Roger Ebert felt that Gellar and co-star Ryan Phillippe "develop a convincing emotional charge" and that Gellar is "effective as a bright girl who knows exactly how to use her act as a tramp". Rob Blackwelder for SPLICEDwire called her performance "dazzling" and wrote that the actress "plunges headlong into the lascivious malevolence that makes Kathryn so delightfully wicked. (Plus she looks great in a corset.)". In an interview with Chicago Tribune, director Roger Kumble, describing Gellar's work in the movie, said: "She unquestionably is the most professional actor I ever worked with". Around that time, she guest-starred in three episodes of Angel and appeared as Debbie in the HBO series Sex and the City episode "Escape from New York".http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0512834/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_31http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0512863/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_31http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0512893/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_31http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0698632/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_29 Gellar subsequently was cast in a leading role as a mobster's daughter in James Toback's independent drama Harvard Man, which premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival before receiving a limited theatrical release the following year.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242508/releaseinfo It  rated average with reviewers, but feedback towards the actress was more positive as some critics felt her character in the movie shared the same nature of her role of Kathryn Merteuil in Cruel Intentions; Variety remarked that Gellar was "fun to watch in the adorable, devious bitch mode she test-drove" in her portrayal of Kathryn, and similarly, DVD Talk wrote that Gellar's "self-serving Mafia Maiden echoes her bitchy turn" in the 1999 film. Her sexual performance in Harvard Man, along with Cruel Intentions, helped her shed her good girl image. Gellar appeared as Daphne Blake in Scooby-Doo, which was released on June 14, 2002, in the U.S.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267913/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt Reviews for the film were moslty negative but it was a major commercial success with a total gross of US$275,650,703, becoming the 15th most successful film worldwide of 2002 (and the highest grossing movie of Gellar's career to date). Gellar won the Teen Choice Award in the category of Choice Movie Actress – Comedy for her part in the picture. Alongside Jack Black, she hosted the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, which attracted 7.1 million viewers on its June 6 broadcast, achieving the show's highest rating ever at the time. During her growing film career, Gellar continued work on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but she left the show after the seventh season. When asked why, she explained, "This isn't about leaving for a career in movies, or in theater – it's more of a personal decision. I need a rest."[ ]   Shortly after the show's end, Gellar stated that she had no interest in appearing in a Buffy feature film, but that she will consider it if the script is good enough. She did not appear in the final season of Angel, causing the intended episode ("You're Welcome") to be rewritten for the character of Cordelia Chase. Gellar has said that she was willing to appear in the episode, but scheduling conflicts and family problems prevented it. Another actress, Giselle Loren, voiced Buffy for an animated series based on the show, which never aired, and the various Buffy video games. In her feature in Esquire magazine Gellar expressed her pride for her work on Buffy, "I truly believe that it is one of the greatest shows of all time and it will go down in history as that. And I don't feel that that is a cocky statement. We changed the way that people looked at television." After the end of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gellar provided her voice for the character Gina Vendetti in The Simpsons episode "The Wandering Juvie" that aired in March 2004. Her next film was the sequel Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, where she reprised the role of Daphne. As the original, the movie also received negative reviews. Critical reception towards Gellar's portrayal was more positive; while Scott Brown for Entertainment Weekly wrote that he rejected Gellar's "Buffyfied Daphne", the review in Slant remarked that she and co-star Prinze "are engaging in their willingness to send up their own teen-idol status". On a similar note, IGN stated that both Gellar and Prinze "exhibit marked improvements over their work in the original". Scooby Doo 2 was a commercial success, grossing US$181,466,833 around the globe.  In October 2004, she appeared in the horror film The Grudge, which was also a major box office hit, ranking number one in its opening weekend with earnings of over US$39 million. It eventually grossed more than US$110 million in the United States and US$187 million worldwide. Critics gave the film mainly mixed reviews, with Gellar's role garnering an equally average reception; View London wrote that she is "fine in the lead" and Hollywood.com concluded that her role "demonstrates she has the soul to carry a flick of this magnitude solo". However, James Berardinelli felt that Gellar played an "unfortunately wooden performance" and commented that the actress, who "has shown a lot more energy in other outings, exhibits only two expressions here: petulance and bewilderment". She then received a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Frightened Performance as well as a nomination for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress – Thriller for the part of Karen. In 2005, she had a voice-over role in an episode of the animated television series Robot Chicken. Since then, Gellar has voiced several other characters, in a total of 14 episodes of the show, as of 2014.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437745/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast Her project, Richard Kelly's comedy-thriller Southland Tales opened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2006 and was eventually released in November 2007 in selected theaters. Gellar had met with Kelly and was drawn to the original ideas for the movie, accepting the role before she even read the script. The film received divided reviews, but Gellar was acclaimed by a number of critics; J. Hoberman wrote for Village Voice that the director "contrives two memorable comic performances" by Gellar and Dwayne Johnson and Elizabeth Weitzman of New York Daily News also admiring both actors' work in the picture, asserted that they "have charisma to spare". eFilmcritic.com singled out Gellar for her interpretation, stating that she "nails the character's New Age-inspired brand of self-absorption so successfully that I wish that Kelly would devise a spin-off story centered entirely on her character". Gellar appeared in The Grudge 2, which came out in October 2006. She had a small part reprising her role from the first film. Although not being as successful as the first installment, the sequel premiered at number one at the box office charts, garnering US$20.8 million in its opening weekend. It became a moderate profit with a total gross of US$70 million from a budget of US$20 million. Gellar next starred in the thriller The Return, that was released the following month and in which she played a businesswoman haunted by memories of her childhood and the mysterious death of a young woman. The film earned mostly negative reviews and was a commercial failure, grossing US$11 million from a production budget of US$15 million. Keith Phipps  of The A.V. Club expressed that Gellar "neither adds to nor detracts from the quality of the project around her", while the New York Times' Jeannette Catsoulis called her participation in the movie a "career stagnation".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/11/movies/11retu.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Jeannette | last=Catsoulis | title=The Return -
