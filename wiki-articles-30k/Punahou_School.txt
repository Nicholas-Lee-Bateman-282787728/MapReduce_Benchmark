 Punahou School (formerly Oahu College) is a private, co-educational, college preparatory school located in Honolulu CDP, City and County of Honolulu in the U.S. State of Hawaii.  With about 3,760 students attending the school, in kindergarten through the twelfth grade, it is the largest independent school in the United States.http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/pre-k-pressure/ Founded in 1841, the school has a rich history, a wide variety of programs, and its most famous alumnus, Barack Obama, who graduated in 1979. Along with academics and athletics, Punahou offers visual and performing arts programs. In 2006, Punahou School was ranked as the "greenest" school in America.http://iws.punahou.edu/department/LukeCenter/sustainability/2006/08/punahou_named_1_green_school_i_1.html  The student body is diverse, with student selection based on both academic and non-academic considerations. In 2008 and 2009, Punahou's sports program was ranked best in the country by Sports Illustrated. In 1795, the land known as Ka Punahou was taken in battle by King Kamehameha I. Along with Ka Punahou, he gave a total of  of land (from the slope of Round Top down to the current Central Union Church, which included a -tract of Kewalo Basin) to chief Kameeiamoku as a reward for his loyalty. After Kameeiamoku died, the land was passed down to his son, Ulumāheihei Hoapili, who lived there for twenty more years. When Hoapili left to become the governor of Maui, he gave the land to his daughter, Kuini Liliha. Ka Punahou was given by Liliha and her husband, Oahu's Governor Boki, to Reverend Hiram Bingham, one of the first Protestant missionaries in Hawaii. Powerful leader Queen Kaahumanu was a strong supporter of the mission, and built a house for herself near the Binghams. A portion of the stone wall she had built to protect the compound from roaming cattle has been preserved. Founded in 1841, Punahou School was originally a school for the children of missionaries serving throughout the Pacific region.  It was the first school with classes only in the English language west of the Rocky Mountains. The first class was held on July 11, 1842, and consisted of only fifteen students. Punahou has educated members of the Hawaiian Royal family in its history, but it is not to be confused with the Royal School. Daniel Dole (1808–1878) was Punahou's first principal. It was known as Oahu College from 1853 to 1934. During World War II, much of the Punahou campus was commandeered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Castle Hall (the girls' dormitory when Punahou had boarding students) was used as a command center, buildings were connected with tunnels, athletic fields were used as parking lots, the library was cleared to become sleeping quarters and an officer's mess. The cereus hedge on the campus lava rock wall was topped with barbed wire. Punahou students volunteered in hospitals and raised enough in war bonds to purchase two bombers and a fighter (among other airplanes) which were named after alumni who had fallen in service."Punahou Goes Home", Hubert V. Coryell, in Hawaii Chronicles III:  World War Two in Hawaii, Bob Dye, U H Press, 2000. In the 1970s, Punahou's upper field and gymnasium were used for the Superstars nationally televised athletic competitions. The campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu on August 7, 1972.  Many traditional events take place on campus. On the first Friday and Saturday of each February, the junior class hosts the Punahou Carnival.  Proceeds from this Carnival contribute to the Financial Aid program. The event is an entertainment highlight each year in Honolulu. Holoku Pageant is an annual celebration of the Hawaiian culture and arts. Students perform Hawaiian dances in traditional costumes, from lovely hula to intimidating ha'a. Sustainability Fair began in 2007 and includes on-campus conservation challenges, as well as off-campus coastline preservation. On Rice Field, classes set up canopies to showcase sustainable undertakings and projects, often including local produce sales and informational handouts. To celebrate the school's homecoming, students, faculty, and teachers surround, then ignite a 20-foot letter "P" at dusk. This event is preceded by a Spirit Week, where students dress and parade creatively. Seniors can look forward to their Variety Show, written and performed by the graduating class. This play involves most of the class, over 300 students. Seniors also have Prom at the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel, Skip Day at the Kikila Estate and Pounders Beach, senior lunch, Baccalaureate ceremonies at Central Union Church, Commencement with men in blue blazers and women in formal white Hawaiian dresses.  Graduates who started Punahou in Kindergarten are members of the Thirteen Plus Club. The school hosts an Alumni Luau on campus during June that the newly graduated class can enjoy with other alumni classes.  The annual luau also functions as a major fundraising event for the school. Throughout most of the school's history, elementary school children have been allowed to attend in bare feet. Aloha shirts were once restricted to Fridays, but dress codes were relaxed considerably during the late Seventies. All schools in Honolulu (public or private) have an urban residential location. Nearby buildings include apartment buildings, private houses, a retirement home, a Catholic school (Maryknoll School), several small churches, and two hospitals. Punahou shares the entrance to Manoa Valley with the University of Hawaii main campus and a few other schools such as Mid-Pacific Institute. Punahou students are a few minutes away from the trail to Manoa Falls, the beaches at Ala Moana and Waikiki, downtown Honolulu, Lyon Arboretum, and the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. The school's location provides many opportunities for off-campus learning:  field trip destinations for middle school students have regularly included the Bishop Museum, Waikiki Aquarium, Waikiki Shell, Waikiki Natatorium War Memorial, Kawaiahaʻo Church, Sea Life Park, USS Arizona Memorial, Valley of the Temples Memorial Park, Fort Ruger at Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay, Honolulu Museum of Art, Honolulu Zoo, Iolani Palace, Hawaii State Capitol, and the famous beaches on Oahu's North Shore.  Clubs and classes often organize trips to neighboring islands, especially to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Kohala Coast on the big island of Hawaii. Tuition is $22,050 for the 2015&ndash;2016 school year, not including student activity fees.  Punahou has long been regarded as an expensive school among locals, but comparable Harvard Westlake School and Sidwell Friends School charge well over $30,000 in tuition, with day tuition at Deerfield Academy  above $35,000, Choate Rosemary Hall at $40,000, and Groton School above $40,000.http://www.groton.org/about/essentialshttp://deerfield.edu/apply/financial-aid/http://www.choate.edu/admission/financial_tuitioninfo.aspxhttp://www.sidwell.edu/admissions/tuition-and-fees/index.aspxhttp://www.hw.com/admission/AffordingHW.aspx Tuition does not cover the entire cost of educating a student, and this "deficit" is met by the school's endowment.  Punahou reported its endowment at $239M in 2014. The raw value of the land is considerable for a private school:  land values in lower Manoa Valley routinely exceed $1M/.3 acre,trulia.com making Punahou's 76 acres worth as much as its endowment.  Although these figures are high among mainland U.S. private schools, Honolulu also has Iolani School with a comparable endowment (twice the endowment per pupil), and Kamehameha Schools has a $5B to $9B endowment (30 times the endowment per pupil) with a larger physical plant. (Maui has Seabury Hall which has twice the endowment per pupil) Summer school academic classes, training in music and dance, and sports camps are offered at all grade levels (K-12).  Courses include Recycling through Art ($500, grades 3-5), Chess Tactics ($250, grades 3-12), Language of Hawaii ($200, grades 7-8), Self-Defense ($175, grades 9-12), and JROTC Leadership Camp ($75, grades 9-12).

The school repeatedly stresses in its publications that it emphasizes character over academics and athletics. About 5000 faculty, students, and staff work in 44 buildings on 76 acres.  Before plans were made for a new middle school complex, America Online founder and alumnus Steve Case ('76) donated ten million dollars. This led to construction of a new middle school for grades six through eight. The Case Middle School was actually named after the donor's parents. The project earned the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certification  and a Project of the Year award in Hawaiian Electric Company's Energy Efficiency Awards. Sensors shut off air conditioners if windows are opened to let in the breeze; the buildings are designed to take full use of the tradewinds, with the help of the Venturi effect. There are also sensors in place that turn the lights on or off depending on whether motion is detected, and dim the lights on sunny days or brighten them on overcast or cloudy ones. Air conditioning for the buildings is provided by three ice-making plants, one for each grade level's section. The units freeze and accumulate ice at night when electricity is cheaper, and allow the ice to melt during the day to cool the air. Case Middle School consists of nine buildings with a total cost of roughly $50 million USD, made possible solely through donations. In late 2010 a new five-building indoor/outdoor section of campus opened for Punahou's youngest students.http://www.punahou.edu/page.cfm?p=1824  It was constructed and operated with sustainable living as a principal goal, and the curriculum has a focus on sustainability.  With solar energy, efficient landscaping, rain catchment and eco-friendly materials, the complex received a platinum rating from the U.S. Green Building Council. Teachers are encouraged to personalize their classroom spaces, and each of the 12 rooms has its own outdoor area that is one-third the size of the interior space to which it is attached. The total cost was $26 million.  Individual buildings are named the Mountain House, Forest House, and City House, and historic Wilcox Hall retains its traditional name.  Board of Trustee member and ebay founder Pierre Omidyar ('84*) donated six million dollars to the project. The Punahou athletics program is the most successful in the state.

The song is sung to the tune of Maryland, My Maryland also known as "O Tannenbaum". The spelling is from the original words to "Oahu A" written in 1902 by a student. Ready? Hit it! Strawberry Shortcake, Huckleberry Pie V&nbsp;— I&nbsp;— C&nbsp;— T&nbsp;— O&nbsp;— R&nbsp;— Y Are We In It? Well I Guess! Punahou, Punahou, Yes, Yes, Yes! This cheer is typically shouted by the marching band and cheerleaders at Punahou, at events such as football games and other sports activities and gatherings following the alma mater. Punahou doesn't have an official mascot. The symbol that perhaps most closely qualifies as a school mascot is the hala tree, whose image is used in the school's seal. Fans often refer to athletic teams as the "Sons of Oahu", or "Buff & Blue" (It was in 1890 that the colors buff and blue officially became Punahou's school colors depicting the hues of the sand and the sea. Back in 1890, long before the development of high-rises and hotels in Waikiki, all that was visible in the distance from the top of Punahou's campus was the buff-colored sand and blue-colored sea of Waikiki Beach which is probably why the colors buff and blue were chosen.)

He received honorary degrees from eleven major universities, but when he died in 1914 the Honolulu Mail announced simply: 'The great scholar was educated at Punahou.'  None of the rest really mattered."  (Michener, Hawaii) "Gramps grabbed me by the arm.  'Hell, Bar,' he whispered, 'this isn't a school.  This is heaven.'" (Obama, Dreams from My Father) "... I wanted a station wagon like the family in The Brady Bunch.  I wanted to go steady with someone like Marcia or Jan, girls who dressed mod and spoke cool. My new school was full of girls like Marcia and Jan.  I'd just started seventh grade at Punahou ... ."

It will make you better men and women if you will let it. Get all of it you can. Your special gaieties, parties, and things are of no account whatever compared with the ministry of mountain and sea. Listen to them, approach and live with them all you can. Hear and heed the great silent teachers about you."https://books.google.com/books/about/A_leader_of_freemen.html?id=5tUDAAAAYAAJ - Letter from General S. C. Armstrong, 1888 "With you rides humanity's best hope.  For who of your generation anywhere has had a better start?  Who at this stage, anywhere in the world, is better qualified? Your generation will win its gold medals, its Pulitzers, its Nobels.  Why not you?  Your generation will produce its important and enduring work.  Why not yours?  From your generation will come those who relieve suffering, stand up to injustice, beat back ignorance, write the great books, sing the great arias, forge a lasting peace.  Why not you?" - Baccalaureate Address by Punahou English teacher David McCullough, Jr., 1999 "Dream big dreams is my best advice. People usually sell themselves short ... When ambitions are all geared towards material goods and money, I think it displays a poverty of ambition ... The world is big ... and everybody here could be doing so much in whatever field is interesting to you. If you're into medicine, your dream should be how to cure AIDS or cancer; if you're interested in the law, you should aim for the Supreme Court; if you're into music, you should want to have hit #1 on the Billboard charts or write a symphony. The world offers so many opportunities, and I think all of you have so much potential and so much talent; it's just a matter of digging deep. Once you have dreamed those big dreams, you'll have to work hard to achieve them. There's nothing wrong with hard work."http://iws.punahou.edu/punablogs/pfa/archives/currents/Currents_Jan05.pdf - Chapel Address by Senator-Elect Barack Obama, Jr., 2004 List of Punahou School alumni "Punahou School: a private school with a public purpose", Hawaii Business, September 1, 2003.  http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2021/is_200309/ai_n9142055 A.
