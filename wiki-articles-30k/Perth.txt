     Perth  is the capital and largest city of the Australian state of Western Australia. It is the fourth-most populous city in Australia, with an estimated population of 2.02&nbsp;million () living in Greater Perth. Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia, with the majority of the metropolitan area of Perth located on the Swan Coastal Plain, a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp, a low coastal escarpment. The first areas settled were on the Swan River, with the city's central business district and port (Fremantle) both located on its shores. Perth is formally divided into a number of local government areas, which themselves consist of a large number of suburbs, extending from Two Rocks in the north to Rockingham in the south, and east inland to The Lakes. Perth was originally founded by Captain James Stirling in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony. It gained city status (currently vested in the smaller City of Perth) in 1856, and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929. The city is named after Perth, Scotland, due to the influence of Sir George Murray, then British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. The city's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century, largely as a result of emigration from the eastern colonies of Australia. During Australia's involvement in World War II, Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre, and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay. An influx of immigrants after the war, predominantly from Britain, Greece, Italy and Yugoslavia, led to rapid population growth. This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for a number of large mining operations located around the state. As part of Perth's role as the capital of Western Australia, the state's Parliament and Supreme Court are located within the city, as is Government House, the residence of the Governor of Western Australia. Perth became known worldwide as the "City of Light" when city residents lit their house lights and streetlights as American astronaut John Glenn passed overhead while orbiting the earth on Friendship&nbsp;7 in 1962.(1970) Perth&nbsp;– a city of light Perth, W.A. Brian Williams Productions for the Government of WA, 1970 (Video recording) The social and recreational life of Perth. Begins with a 'mock-up' of the lights of Perth as seen by astronaut John Glenn in February 1962 The city repeated the act as Glenn passed overhead on the Space Shuttle in 1998. Perth came 8th in the Economist Intelligence Unit's August 2015 list of the world's most liveable cities, and was classified by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2010 as a world city.Perth ranked as a "Beta–" class world city:  Before European colonisation, the area had been inhabited by the Whadjuk Noongar people for over 40,000 years, as evidenced by archaeological findings on the Upper Swan River. These Noongar people occupied the southwest corner of Western Australia and lived as hunter-gatherers. The wetlands on the Swan Coastal Plain were particularly important to them, both spiritually, featuring in local mythology, and as a source of food. Rottnest, Carnac and Garden Islands were also important to the Noongar people.  The area where Perth now stands is also known as Boorloo by the Noongar people. Boorloo formed part of Mooro, the tribal lands of Yellagonga's group, one of several based around the Swan River and known collectively as the Whadjuk. The Whadjuk were part of a larger group of fourteen tribes that formed the south-west socio-linguistic block known as the Noongar (meaning "the people" in their language), also sometimes called the Bibbulmun. On 19 September 2006, the Federal Court of Australia brought down a judgment recognising Noongar native title over the Perth metropolitan area, in the case of Bennell v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1243. The judgment was overturned on appeal. The first documented sighting of the region was made by the Dutch Captain Willem de Vlamingh and his crew on 10 January 1697. Subsequent sightings between this date and 1829 were made by other Europeans, but as in the case of the sighting and observations made by Vlamingh, the area was considered to be inhospitable and unsuitable for the agriculture that would be needed to sustain a settlement.Appleyard, R. T. and Manford, Toby (1979). The Beginning: European Discovery and Early Settlement of Swan River Western Australia, University of Western Australia Press. ISBN 0-85564-146-0   Although the British Army had established a base at King George Sound (later Albany) on the south coast of Western Australia in 1826 in response to rumours that the area would be annexed by France, Perth was the first full-scale settlement by Europeans in the western third of the continent. The British colony would be officially designated Western Australia in 1832, but was known informally for many years as the Swan River Colony after the area's major watercourse. On 4 June 1829, newly arriving British colonists had their first view of the mainland, and Western Australia's founding has since been recognised by a public holiday on the first Monday in June each year. Captain James Stirling, aboard Parmelia, said that Perth was "as beautiful as anything of this kind I had ever witnessed". On 12 August that year, Helen Dance, wife of the captain of the second ship, Sulphur, cut down a tree to mark the founding of the town. It is clear that Stirling had already selected the name Perth for the capital well before the town was proclaimed, as his proclamation of the colony, read in Fremantle on 18 June 1829, ended "given under my hand and Seal at Perth this 18th Day of June 1829. James Stirling Lieutenant Governor". The only contemporary information on the source of the name comes from Fremantle's diary entry for 12 August, which records that they "named the town Perth according to the wishes of Sir George Murray". Murray was born in Perth, Scotland, and was in 1829 Secretary of State for the Colonies and Member for Perthshire in the British House of Commons. The town was named after the Scottish Perth, in Murray's honour. Beginning in 1831, hostile encounters between the British settlers and the Noongar people&nbsp;– both large-scale land users with conflicting land value systems&nbsp;– increased considerably as the colony grew. The hostile encounters between the two groups of people resulted in a number of events, including the execution of the Whadjuk elder Midgegooroo, the death of his son Yagan in 1833, and the Pinjarra massacre in 1834. The racial relations between the Noongar people and the Europeans were strained due to these happenings. Because of the large amount of building in and around Boorloo, the local Whadjuk Noongar people were slowly dispossessed of their country. They were forced to camp around prescribed areas, including the swamps and lakes north of the settlement area including Third Swamp, known to them as Boodjamooling. Boodjamooling continued to be a main camp-site for the remaining Noongar people in the Perth region, and was also used by travellers, itinerants, and homeless people. By the gold-rush days of the 1890s they were joined by miners who were en route to the goldfields. In 1850, Western Australia was opened to convicts at the request of farming and business people looking for cheap labour. Queen Victoria announced the city status of Perth in 1856.  After a referendum in 1900, Western Australia joined the Federation of Australia in 1901. It was the last of the Australian colonies to agree to join the Federation, and did so only after the other colonies had offered several concessions, including the construction of a transcontinental railway line from Port Augusta in South Australia to Kalgoorlie to link Perth with the eastern states. In 1933, Western Australia voted in a referendum to leave the Australian Federation, with a majority of two to one in favour of secession. However, an election held shortly before the referendum had voted out the incumbent "pro-independence" government, replacing it with a government that did not support the independence movement. Respecting the result of the referendum, the new government nonetheless petitioned the Agent General of the United Kingdom for independence, where the request was simply ignored.  Perth's growth and relative prosperity, especially since the mid-1960s,  has resulted from its role as the main service centre for the state's resource industries, which extract gold, iron ore, nickel, alumina, diamonds, mineral sands, coal, oil, and natural gas. Whilst most mineral and petroleum production takes place elsewhere in the state, the non-base services provide most of the employment and income to the people of Perth.  The central business district of Perth is bounded by the Swan River to the south and east, with Kings Park on the western end, while the railway reserve formed a northern border. A state and federally funded project named Perth City Link sunk a section of the railway line, to link Northbridge and the CBD for the first time in 100 years. The Perth Arena is a building in the city link area that has received a number of architecture awards. St Georges Terrace is the prominent street of the area with 1.3&nbsp;million&nbsp;m2 of office space in the CBD. Hay Street and Murray Street have most of the retail and entertainment facilities. The tallest building in the city is Central Park, which is the seventh tallest building in Australia. The CBD has recently been the centre of a mining-induced boom, with several commercial and residential projects being built, including Brookfield Place, a  office building for Anglo-Australian mining company BHP Billiton. Perth is set on the Swan River, named for the native black swans by Willem de Vlamingh, captain of a Dutch expedition and namer of WA's Rottnest Island who discovered the birds while exploring the area in 1697. Traditionally, this water body had been known by Aboriginal inhabitants as Derbarl Yerrigan. The city centre and most of the suburbs are located on the sandy and relatively flat Swan Coastal Plain, which lies between the Darling Scarp and the Indian Ocean. The soils of this area are quite infertile. The metropolitan area extends along the coast to Two Rocks in the north and Singleton to the south, a total distance of approximately . From the coast in the west to Mundaring in the east is a total distance of approximately . The Perth metropolitan area covers . Much of Perth was originally built on a series of freshwater wetlands running from Herdsman Lake in the west through to Claisebrook Cove in the east. To the east, the city is bordered by a low escarpment called the Darling Scarp. Perth is on generally flat, rolling land&nbsp;– largely due to the high amount of sandy soils and deep bedrock. The Perth metropolitan area has two major river systems: the first is made up of the Swan and Canning Rivers; the second is that of the Serpentine and Murray Rivers, which discharge into the Peel Inlet at Mandurah. Perth receives moderate though highly seasonal rainfall, making it the fourth wettest Australian capital city after Darwin, Sydney and Brisbane. Summers are generally very hot and dry, lasting from December to late March, with February generally being the hottest month of the year. Winters are relatively mild and wet, making Perth a classic example of a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). Perth is a particularly sunny city for this type of climate; it has an average of 8.8 hours of sunshine per day, which equates to around 3200 hours of annual sunshine, and 138.7 clear days annually, making it the sunniest capital city in Australia. Summer is not completely devoid of rain and humidity, with sporadic rainfall in the form of short-lived thunderstorms, weak cold fronts and on occasions decaying tropical cyclones from Western Australia's north-west, which can bring significant rainfall. Winters are also known to be clear and sunny. The highest temperature recorded in Perth was  on 23 February 1991, although Perth Airport recorded  on the same day. On most summer afternoons a sea breeze, known locally as the "Fremantle Doctor", blows from the southwest, providing relief from the hot north-easterly winds. Temperatures often fall below  a few hours after the arrival of the wind change. In the summer, the 3&nbsp;pm dewpoint averages at around . Winters are wet but mild, with most of Perth's annual rainfall being between May and September. The lowest temperature recorded in Perth was  on 17 June 2006. The lowest temperature within the Perth metropolitan area was  on the same day at Jandakot Airport. However, temperatures at or below zero are very rare occurrences and it seldom gets cold enough for frost to form. The rainfall pattern has changed in Perth and southwest Western Australia since the mid-1970s. A significant reduction in winter rainfall has been observed with a greater number of extreme rainfall events in the summer months, such as the slow-moving storms on 8 February 1992 that brought  of rain, the highest recorded in Perth, and a severe thunderstorm on 22 March 2010, which brought  of rain and caused significant damage in the metropolitan area. {{Weather box |location = Perth, Western Australia |metric first = Yes |single line = Yes |Jan record high C = 45.8 |Feb record high C = 46.2 |Mar record high C = 42.4 |Apr record high C = 37.6 |May record high C = 34.3 |Jun record high C = 28.1 |Jul record high C = 26.3 |Aug record high C = 27.8 |Sep record high C = 34.2 |Oct record high C = 37.3 |Nov record high C = 40.3 |Dec record high C = 44.2 |year record high C = 46.2 |Jan high C = 31.2 |Feb high C = 31.7 |Mar high C = 29.6 |Apr high C = 25.9 |May high C = 22.3 |Jun high C = 19.4 |Jul high C = 18.4 |Aug high C = 19.1 |Sep high C = 20.4 |Oct high C = 23.4 |Nov high C = 26.6 |Dec high C = 29.1 |year high C = 24.8 |Jan mean C = 25.0 |Feb mean C = 25.1 |Mar mean C = 23.1 |Apr mean C = 19.9 |May mean C = 16.4 |Jun mean C = 14.0 |Jul mean C = 13.1 |Aug mean C = 13.7 |Sep mean C = 15.0 |Oct mean C = 17.5 |Nov mean C = 20.5 |Dec mean C = 22.8 |year mean C = 18.8 |Jan low C = 18.1 |Feb low C = 18.4 |Mar low C = 16.6 |Apr low C = 13.8 |May low C = 10.5 |Jun low C = 8.6 |Jul low C = 7.7 |Aug low C = 8.3 |Sep low C = 9.6 |Oct low C = 11.5 |Nov low C = 14.3 |Dec low C = 16.4 |year low C = 12.8 |Jan record low C = 8.9 |Feb record low C = 8.7 |Mar record low C = 6.3 |Apr record low C = 4.1 |May record low C = 1.3 |Jun record low C = −0.7 |Jul record low C = 0.0 |Aug record low C = 1.3 |Sep record low C = 1.0 |Oct record low C = 2.2 |Nov record low C = 5.0 |Dec record low C = 7.9 |year record low C = −0.7 |Jan rain mm = 15.4 |Feb rain mm = 8.8 |Mar rain mm = 20.5 |Apr rain mm = 36.5 |May rain mm = 90.2 |Jun rain mm = 126.7 |Jul rain mm = 144.7 |Aug rain mm = 122.4 |Sep rain mm = 88.0 |Oct rain mm = 38.6 |Nov rain mm = 23.7 |Dec rain mm = 9.9 |year rain mm = 730.5 |Jan precipitation days = 2.4 |Feb precipitation days = 2.1 |Mar precipitation days = 4.1 |Apr precipitation days = 6.7 |May precipitation days = 11.1 |Jun precipitation days = 15.2 |Jul precipitation days = 16.9 |Aug precipitation days = 15.7 |Sep precipitation days = 15.3 |Oct precipitation days = 8.7 |Nov precipitation days = 6.3 |Dec precipitation days = 3.9 |year precipitation days = 108.4 |humidity colour = green |Jan humidity = 39 |Feb humidity = 38 |Mar humidity = 39 |Apr humidity = 46 |May humidity = 50 |Jun humidity = 56 |Jul humidity = 57 |Aug humidity = 54 |Sep humidity = 53 |Oct humidity = 46 |Nov humidity = 44 |Dec humidity = 41 |year humidity = 47 |Jan sun = 360.6 |Feb sun = 314.9 |Mar sun = 295.5 |Apr sun = 246.0 |May sun = 211.7 |Jun sun = 180.6 |Jul sun = 188.4 |Aug sun = 219.8 |Sep sun = 232.4 |Oct sun = 299.8 |Nov sun = 320.4 |Dec sun = 359.4 |year sun = 3229.5 |Jand sun= 11.5 |Febd sun= 11.0 |Mard sun= 9.6 |Aprd sun= 8.3 |Mayd sun= 6.9 |Jund sun= 5.9 |Juld sun= 6.1 |Augd sun= 7.2 |Sepd sun= 7.7 |Octd sun= 9.6 |Novd sun= 10.6 |Decd sun= 11.5 |yeard sun= 8.8 |source 1 = Bureau of MeteorologyTemperatures: 1993–2015;

The ethnic make-up of Perth changed in the second part of the 20th century, when significant numbers of continental European immigrants arrived in the city. Prior to this, Perth's population had been almost completely [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] in ethnic origin. As [[Fremantle]] was the first landfall in Australia for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, Perth started to experience a diverse influx of people, including [[Italian Australians|Italians]], [[Greek people|Greeks]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Croatian people|Croats]]. The Italian influence in the Perth and Fremantle area has been substantial, evident in places like the "Cappuccino strip" in Fremantle featuring many Italian eateries and shops. In Fremantle the traditional Italian [[blessing of the fleet]] festival is held every year at the start of the fishing season.

Perth's economy has been changing in favour of the service industries since the 1950s.

It was simply cheaper to import all the needed manufactured goods from either the [[Eastern states of Australia|eastern states]] or overseas.  Industrial employment influenced the economic geography of Perth. After WWII, Perth experienced suburban expansion aided by high levels of car ownership. Workforce decentralisation and transport improvements made it possible for the establishment of small-scale manufacturing in the suburbs. Many firms took advantage of relatively cheap land to build spacious, single-storey plants in suburban locations with plentiful parking, easy access and minimal traffic congestion. "The former close ties of manufacturing with near-central and/or rail-side locations were loosened."<ref name="GreaterPerth"/>  Industrial estates such as Kwinana, Welshpool and Kewdale were post-war additions contributing to the growth of manufacturing south of the river. The establishment of the Kwinana industrial area was supported by standardisation of the east-west rail gauge linking Perth with eastern Australia. Since the 1950s the area has been dominated by heavy industry, including an oil refinery, steel-rolling mill with a blast furnace, alumina refinery, power station and a nickel refinery. Another development, also linked with rail standardisation, was in 1968 when the [[Kewdale Freight Terminal]] was developed adjacent to the Welshpool industrial area, replacing the former Perth railway yards.<ref name="GreaterPerth"/>  With significant population growth post-WWII,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/productsbyCatalogue/632CDC28637CF57ECA256F1F0080EBCC?OpenDocument |title=Australian Historical Population Statistics 2008|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=5 August 2008|accessdate=1 January 2009}}</ref> employment growth occurred not in manufacturing but in retail and wholesale trade, business services, health, education, community and personal services and in public administration.

[[File:AFI @ Soundwave Perth 2010 (4397522055).jpg|thumb|right|Soundwave Perth in 2010]] A number of annual events are held in Perth. The [[Perth International Arts Festival]] is a large cultural festival that has been held annually since 1953, and has since been joined by the Winter Arts festival, Perth Fringe Festival, and Perth Writers Festival. Perth also hosts annual music festivals including Future Music, Stereosonic and [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]]. The [[Perth International Comedy Festival]] features a variety of local and international comedic talent, with performances held at the Astor Theatre and nearby venues in Mount Lawley, and regular night food markets throughout the summer months across Perth and its surrounding suburbs. [[Sculpture by the Sea]] showcases a range of local and international sculptors' creations along [[Cottesloe, Western Australia|Cottesloe Beach]].  There is also a wide variety of [[List of public art in Western Australia|public art and sculptures]] on display across the city, throughout the year. [[File:Perth Night Noodle Markets.jpg|thumb|The Noodle Night Markets in March at the Perth Cultural Centre]]  Perth has featured in a variety of artistic works in various mediums. An early novel, ''[[Moondyne]]'', set in the [[Swan River Colony]], was written by a former Fenian convict, [[John Boyle O'Reilly]], and a ''A Faithful Picture'', edited by [[Peter Cowan (writer)|Peter Cowan]], gives a good idea of the early days of the colony. Songs that refer to the city include "I Love Perth" (1996) by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], and "Perth" (2011) by [[Bon Iver]], while a number of films feature Perth: ''[[Last Train to Freo]]'', ''[[Two Fists, One Heart]]'', ''[[Thunderstruck (2004 film)|Thunderstruck]]'', ''[[Bran Nue Dae (film)|Bran Nue Dae]]'', ''[[Japanese Story]]'' and ''[[Nickel Queen]]''. The industrial metal band [[Fear Factory]] recorded the video for their single "[[Cyberwaste]]" in South Fremantle.  Because of Perth's relative isolation from other Australian cities, overseas artists often exclude it from their Australian tour schedules. This isolation, however, has developed a strong local music scene, and the development of local music groups such as [[John Butler Trio]], [[The Triffids]], [[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]], [[Eskimo Joe]], [[Pond (Australian band)|Pond]], [[Tame Impala]], [[Karnivool]], [[Gyroscope]], [[Jebediah]], [[Little Birdy]], [[The Panics]] and [[Birds of Tokyo]]. Celebrity musical performers from Perth have included the late [[AC/DC]] lead singer [[Bon Scott]], who has been remembered with a statue in Fremantle, and veteran performer and artist [[Rolf Harris]], given the nickname "The Boy From [[Bassendean, Western Australia|Bassendean]]".  The largest performance area within the State Theatre Centre, the Heath Ledger Theatre, is named in honour of Perth-born film actor [[Heath Ledger]].  ===Tourism and recreation=== {{Main|Tourism in Perth}} [[File:WTF Roel Loopers High Street from above, Fremantle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fremantle]] is known for its well-preserved architectural heritage.]] Tourism in Perth is an important part of the state's economy, with approximately 2.8&nbsp;million domestic visitors and 0.7&nbsp;million international visitors in the year ending March 2012.<ref name=QVS-march12>{{cite web|title=Quarterly Visitor Snapshot – Year Ending March 2012 |url=http://www.tourism.wa.gov.au/Publications%20Library/Research/Research%20and%20Reports/QVS%20YE%20March%202012v3.pdf |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=8 July 2012 |author=Tourism Western Australia |page=32 |format=PDF |date=June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130516161723/http://www.tourism.wa.gov.au/Publications%20Library/Research/Research%20and%20Reports/QVS%20YE%20March%202012v3.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2013 }}</ref> Tourist attractions are generally focused around the city centre, Fremantle, the coast, and the Swan River.
