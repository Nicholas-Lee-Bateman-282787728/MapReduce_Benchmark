 In recreational mathematics, a repunit is a number like 11, 111, or 1111 that contains only the digit 1 &mdash; a more specific type of repdigit. The term stands for repeated unit and was coined in 1966 by Albert H. Beiler in his book Recreations in the Theory of Numbers. A repunit prime is a repunit that is also a prime number. Primes that are repunits in base 2 are Mersenne primes. The base-b repunits are defined as (this b can be either positive or negative) R_n^{(b)}={b^n-1\over{b-1}}\qquad\mbox{for }|b|\ge2, n\ge1. Thus, the number Rn(b) consists of n copies of the digit 1 in base b representation. The first two repunits base b for n=1 and n=2 are R_1^{(b)}={b-1\over{b-1}}= 1 \qquad \text{and} \qquad R_2^{(b)}={b^2-1\over{b-1}}= b+1\qquad\text{for}\ |b|\ge2. In particular, the decimal (base-10) repunits that are often referred to as simply repunits are defined as R_n=R_n^{(10)}={10^n-1\over{10-1}}={10^n-1\over9}\qquad\mbox{for }n\ge1. Thus, the number Rn = Rn(10) consists of n copies of the digit 1 in base 10 representation. The sequence of repunits base 10 starts with 1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, 111111, ... . Similarly, the repunits base 2 are defined as R_n^{(2)}={2^n-1\over{2-1}}={2^n-1}\qquad\mbox{for }n\ge1. Thus, the number Rn(2) consists of n copies of the digit 1 in base 2 representation. In fact, the base-2 repunits are the well-known Mersenne numbers Mn&nbsp;=&nbsp;2n&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, they start with 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, 32767, 65535, ...  since 35 = 7 × 5 = 5 × 7.  This repunit factorization does not depend on the base b in which the repunit is expressed.

The definition of repunits was motivated by recreational mathematicians looking for prime factors of such numbers. It is easy to show that if n is divisible by a, then Rn(b) is divisible by Ra(b): R_n^{(b)}=\frac{1}{b-1}\prod_{d|n}\Phi_d(b) where \Phi_d(x) is the d^\mathrm{th} cyclotomic polynomial and d ranges over the divisors of n. For p prime, \Phi_p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}x^i, which has the expected form of a repunit when x is substituted with b. For example, 9 is divisible by 3, and thus R9 is divisible by R3&mdash;in fact, 111111111&nbsp;=&nbsp;111&nbsp;·&nbsp;1001001. The corresponding cyclotomic polynomials \Phi_3(x) and \Phi_9(x) are x^2+x+1 and x^6+x^3+1 respectively. Thus, for Rn to be prime n must necessarily be prime. But it is not sufficient for n to be prime; for example, R3&nbsp;=&nbsp;111&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;·&nbsp;37 is not prime. Except for this case of R3,  p can only divide Rn for prime n if p = 2kn + 1 for some k. Rn is prime for n&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,&nbsp;19,&nbsp;23, 317, 1031, ... (sequence A004023 in OEIS). R49081 and R86453 are probably prime.  On April 3, 2007 Harvey Dubner (who also found R49081) announced that R109297 is a probable prime.Harvey Dubner, New Repunit R(109297) He later announced there are no others from R86453 to R200000.Harvey Dubner, Repunit search limit On July 15, 2007 Maksym Voznyy announced R270343 to be probably prime,Maksym Voznyy, New PRP Repunit R(270343) along with his intent to search to 400000. As of November 2012, all further candidates up to R2500000 have been tested, but no new probable primes have been found so far. It has been conjectured that there are infinitely many repunit primesChris Caldwell, "The Prime Glossary: repunit" at The Prime Pages. and they seem to occur roughly as often as the prime number theorem would predict: the exponent of the Nth repunit prime is generally around a fixed multiple of the exponent of the (N-1)th. The prime repunits are a trivial subset of the permutable primes, i.e., primes that remain prime after any permutation of their digits. Base 2 repunit primes are called Mersenne primes. The first few base 3 repunit primes are 13, 1093, 797161, 3754733257489862401973357979128773, 6957596529882152968992225251835887181478451547013  corresponding to n of 3, 7, 13, 71, 103, 541, 1091, 1367, 1627, 4177, 9011, 9551, ... . The only base 4 repunit prime is 5 (11_4). 4^n-1=\left(2^n+1\right)\left(2^n-1\right), and 3 always divides 2^n+1 when n is odd and 2^n-1 when n is even. For n greater than 2, both 2^n+1 and 2^n-1 are greater than 3, so removing the factor of 3 still leaves two factors greater than 1, so the number cannot be prime. The first few base 5 repunit primes are 31, 19531, 12207031, 305175781, 177635683940025046467781066894531, 14693679385278593849609206715278070972733319459651094018859396328480215743184089660644531, 35032461608120426773093239582247903282006548546912894293926707097244777067146515037165954709053039550781, 815663058499815565838786763657068444462645532258620818469829556933715405574685778402862015856733535201783524826169013977050781  corresponding to n of 3, 7, 11, 13, 47, 127, 149, 181, 619, 929, 3407, ... .

The only base 8 repunit prime is 73 (111_8). 8^n-1=\left(4^n+2^n+1\right)\left(2^n-1\right), and 7 divides 4^n+2^n+1 when n is not divisible by 3 and 2^n-1 when n is a multiple of 3. There are no base 9 repunit primes. 9^n-1=\left(3^n+1\right)\left(3^n-1\right), and 2 always divides both 3^n+1 and 3^n-1.

For more information, see.Repunit primes in base −50 to 50Repunit primes in base 2 to 152Repunit primes in base −151 to −2Repunit primes in base −200 to −2 If b is a perfect power (can be written as mn, with m, n integers, n > 1) differs from 1, then there is at most one repunit in base b. If n is a prime power (can be written as pr, with p prime, r integer, p, r >0), then all repunit in base b are not prime aside from Rp and R2. Rp can be either prime or composite, the former examples, b = -216, -128, 4, 8, 16, 27, 36, 100, 128, 256, etc., the latter examples, b = -243, -125, -64, -32, -27, -8, 9, 25, 32, 49, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 196, 216, 225, 243, 289, etc., and R2 can be prime (when p differs from 2) only if b is negative, a power of -2, for example, b = -8, -32, -128, -8192, etc., in fact, the R2 can also be composite, for example, b = -512, -2048, -32768, etc. If n is not a prime power, then no base b repunit prime exists, for example, b = 64, 729 (with n = 6), b = 1024 (with n = 10), and b = -1 or 0 (with n any natural number). Another special situation is b = -4k4, with k positive integer, which has the aurifeuillean factorization, for example, b = -4 (with k = 1, then R2 and R3 are primes), and b = -64, -324, -1024, -2500, -5184, ... (with k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...), then no base b repunit prime exists. It is also conjectured that when b is neither a perfect power nor -4k4 with k positive integer, then there are infinity many base b repunit primes. A conjecture related to the generalized repunit primes:Deriving the Wagstaff Mersenne ConjectureGeneralized Repunit Conjecture (the conjecture predicts where is the next generalized Mersenne prime, if the conjecture is true, then there are infinitely many repunit primes for all bases b) For any integer b, which satisfies the conditions: has generalized repunit primes of the form R_p(b)=\frac{b^p-1}{b-1} for prime p, the prime numbers will be distributed near the best fit line Y=G \cdot log_{|b|}(log_{|b|}(R_{(b)}(n)))+C where limit n\rightarrow\infty, G=\frac{1}{e^\gamma}=0.561459483566... and there are about (log_e(N)+m \cdot log_e(2) \cdot log_e(log_e(N))+\frac{1}{\sqrt N}-\delta) \cdot \frac{e^\gamma}{log_e(|b|)} base b repunit primes less than N. We also have the following 3 properties: Although they were not then known by that name, repunits in base 10 were studied by many mathematicians during the nineteenth century in an effort to work out and predict the cyclic patterns of repeating decimals.Dickson, Leonard Eugene and Cresse, G.H.; History of the Theory of Numbers; pp. 164-167 ISBN 0-8218-1934-8 It was found very early on that for any prime p greater than 5, the period of the decimal expansion of 1/p is equal to the length of the smallest repunit number that is divisible by p. Tables of the period of reciprocal of primes up to 60,000 had been published by 1860 and permitted the factorization by such mathematicians as Reuschle of all repunits up to R16 and many larger ones. By 1880, even R17 to R36 had been factoredDickson and Cresse, pp. 164-167 and it is curious that, though Édouard Lucas showed no prime below three million had period nineteen, there was no attempt to test any repunit for primality until early in the twentieth century. The American mathematician Oscar Hoppe proved R19 to be prime in 1916Francis, Richard L.; "Mathematical Haystacks: Another Look at Repunit Numbers" in The College Mathematics Journal, Vol. 19, No. 3. (May, 1988), pp. 240-246. and Lehmer and Kraitchik independently found R23 to be prime in 1929. Further advances in the study of repunits did not occur until the 1960s, when computers allowed many new factors of repunits to be found and the gaps in earlier tables of prime periods corrected. R317 was found to be a probable prime circa 1966 and was proved prime eleven years later, when R1031 was shown to be the only further possible prime repunit with fewer than ten thousand digits. It was proven prime in 1986, but searches for further prime repunits in the following decade consistently failed. However, there was a major side-development in the field of generalized repunits, which produced a large number of new primes and probable primes. Since 1999, four further probably prime repunits have been found, but it is unlikely that any of them will be proven prime in the foreseeable future because of their huge size. The Cunningham project endeavours to document the integer factorizations of (among other numbers) the repunits to base 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12. The  Demlo numbers 1, 121, 12321, 1234321, ..., 12345678987654321, 1234567900987654321, 123456790120987654321, ...,  were defined by D. R. Kaprekar as the squares of the repunits, resolving the uncertainty how to continue beyond the highest digit (9), and named after Demlo railway station 30 miles from Bombay on the then G.I.P. Railway, where he thought of investigating them.

Any repunit in any base having a composite number of digits is necessarily composite.  Only repunits (in any base) having a prime number of digits might be prime. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  For example, : R35(b) =  = 11111 × 1000010000100001000010000100001 = 1111111 × 10000001000000100000010000001, Any positive multiple of the repunit Rn(b) contains at least n nonzero digits in base b. The only known numbers that are repunits with at least 3 digits in more than one base simultaneously are 31 (111 in base 5, 11111 in base 2) and 8191 (111 in base 90, 1111111111111 in base 2). The Goormaghtigh conjecture says there are only these two cases. Using the pigeon-hole principle it can be easily shown that for each n and b such that n  and b are relatively prime there exists a repunit in base b that is a multiple of n. To see this consider repunits R1(b),...,Rn(b). Assume none of the Rk(b) is divisible by n. Because there are n repunits but only n-1 non-zero residues modulo n there exist two repunits Ri(b) and Rj(b) with 1≤ii(b) and Rj(b) have the same residue modulo n. It follows that Rj(b) - Ri(b) has residue 0 modulo n, i.e. is divisible by n. Rj(b) - Ri(b) consists of j - i ones followed by i zeroes. Thus, Rj(b) - Ri(b) = Rj-i(b)  x bi . Since n divides the left-hand side it also divides the right-hand side and since n and b are relative prime n must divide Rj-i(b) contradicting the original assumption. The Feit–Thompson conjecture is that Rq(p) never divides Rp(q) for two distinct primes p and q. |b|>1. b is not a perfect power. (since when b is a perfect rth power, it can be shown that there is at most one n value such that \frac{b^n-1}{b-1} is prime, and this n value is r itself or a root of r) b is not in the form -4k^4. (if so, then the number has aurifeuillean factorization) e is the base of natural logarithm. \gamma is Euler–Mascheroni constant. log_{|b|} is the logarithm in base |b|. R_{(b)}(n) is the nth generalized repunit prime in base b (with prime p) C is a data fit constant which varies with b. \delta=1 if b>0, \delta=1.6 if b<0</math>. *<math>m is the largest natural number such that -b is a 2^{m-1}th power. The number of prime numbers of the form \frac{b^n-1}{b-1} (with prime p) less than or equal to n is about e^\gamma \cdot log_{|b|}(log_{|b|}(n)). The expected number of prime numbers of the form \frac{b^n-1}{b-1} with prime p between n and |b| \cdot n is about e^\gamma. The probability that number of the form \frac{b^n-1}{b-1} is prime (for prime p) is about \frac{e^\gamma}{p \cdot log_e(|b|)}.
