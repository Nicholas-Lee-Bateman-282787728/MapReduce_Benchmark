    Wahhabism (, ) or Wahhabi mission (;"Wahhabi". Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ,  ) is a religious movement or branch of Sunni Islam.although some Sunnis dispute whether Wahhabism is Sunni (source: http://www.sunnah.org, Wahhabism:  Understanding the Roots and Role Models of Islamic Extremism, by Zubair Qamar, condensed and edited by ASFA staff) It has been variously described as "ultraconservative",Our good name: a company's fight to defend its honor J. Phillip London, C.A.C.I., Inc&nbsp;– 2008, "wahhabism is considered in particular an ultra-conservative orientation". "austere",  "fundamentalist",  "puritanical"  (or "puritan")  and as an Islamic "reform movement"  to restore "pure monotheistic worship" (tawhid)  by scholars and advocates, and as an "extremist pseudo-Sunni movement" by opponents.Wahhabism:  Understanding the Roots and Role Models of Islamic Extremism, by Zubair Qamar, condensed and edited by ASFA staff, sunnah.org  Adherents often object to the term Wahhabi or Wahhabism as derogatory, and prefer to be called Salafi or muwahhid. Wahhabism is named after an eighteenth-century preacher and scholar, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703–1792).  He started a revivalist movement in the remote, sparsely populated region of Najd, advocating a purging of practices such as the popular "cult of saints", and shrine and tomb visitation, widespread among Muslims, but which he considered idolatry (shirk), impurities and innovations in Islam (Bid'ah).  Eventually he formed a pact with a local leader Muhammad bin Saud offering political obedience and promising that protection and propagation of the Wahhabi movement would mean "power and glory" and rule of "lands and men."  The movement is centred on the principle of Tawhid, or the "uniqueness" and "unity" of God. The movement also draws from the teachings of medieval theologian Ibn Taymiyyah and early jurist Ahmad ibn Hanbal. The alliance between followers of ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Muhammad bin Saud's successors (the House of Saud) proved to be a rather durable alliance. The house of bin Saud continued to maintain its politico-religious alliance with the Wahhabi sect through the waxing and waning of its own political fortunes over the next 150 years, through to its eventual proclamation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, and then afterwards, on into modern times. Today Mohammed bin Abd Al-Wahhab's teachings are state-sponsored and are the official form of Sunni Islam in 21st century Saudi Arabia. Estimates of the number of adherents to Wahhabism vary, with one source (Michael Izady) giving a figure of fewer than 5 million Wahhabis in the Persian Gulf region (compared to 28.5 million Sunnis and 89 million Shia).Other sources give far lower numbers of Shia though they do not estimate the number of Wahhabi (15% of KSA is Shia. sources: Saudi Arabia's Shia press for rights| bbc|by Anees al-Qudaihi | 24 March 2009; and Council on Foreign Relations| Author: Lionel Beehner| June 16, 2006; Vali Nasr, Shia Revival, (2006) p. 236) With the help of funding from petroleum exports (and other factorsAbou El Fadl, Khaled, The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists, Harper San Francisco, 2005, p.70-72.), the movement underwent "explosive growth" beginning in the 1970s and now has worldwide influence.

What made them pagans whose blood could be shed and wealth plundered was that "they sacrificed animals to other beings; they sought the help of other beings; they swore vows by other beings."
