   Michael Laudrup (born 15 June 1964) is a retired Danish footballer and former manager of Qatar Stars League club Lekhwiya. He is the older brother of fellow retired footballer Brian Laudrup. During his playing career, Laudrup won league titles with Ajax, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus. A world class playmaker, he was a member of Johan Cruyff's "Dream Team" at Barcelona, where he won nine trophies, including four successive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and the European Cup in 1992. Laudrup moved to arch rivals Real Madrid in 1994, with whom he won his fifth La Liga title in a row. Laudrup made his debut for the Denmark national football team on his 18th birthday in 1982, and scored 37 goals in 104 appearances. He starred in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, and from November 1994, he captained Denmark for a total of 28 matches,Michael Laudrup started his last 27 matches as captain, while he had taken over the armband in the 1 June 1994 1–2 loss to Norway, when then captain Lars Olsen was substituted. including the victorious 1995 Confederations Cup tournament. He played alongside his brother Brian in the Denmark team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and retired as an active player after the tournament. In 1999, he was voted the Best Foreign Player in Spanish Football over the preceding 25-year periodIFHOC, The Gala in Barcelona, 1 February 1999 and in April 2000 he was knighted, receiving the Order of the Dannebrog. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Denmark by the Danish Football Association; their most outstanding player of the past 50 years.UEFA.com, Golden Players take center stage, 29 November 2003. He was officially named the best Danish footballer of all time by the Danish Football Association (DBU) in November 2006.Michael Laudrup bedste spiller gennem tiderne, DBU.dk, 13 November 2006 He was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players at a FIFA awards ceremony in 2004. In April 2013, he was named by Marca in the "Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid's history". He is widely considered the greatest Scandinavian footballer ever, ahead of the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. After retiring as a player, Laudrup took up coaching, and became assistant manager of the Danish national team. He got his first manager job at former club Brøndby in 2002, whom he guided to the 2005 Danish Superliga championship. He chose not to extend his contract with Brøndby in May 2006. He took over as coach of Getafe, Madrid's third club, and had notable success there. He brought the club comparative success in the Copa del Rey and UEFA Cup, and the team's attacking style brought plaudits. On 15 June 2012, Laudrup was appointed the manager of Premier League club Swansea City, signing a two-year contract.Clutton, Graham (15 June 2012) Laudrup appointed Swansea City manager. Telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved on 2015-04-18. In his first season in south Wales, Laudrup won the League Cup, the first major trophy in Swansea's 100-year history. On 4 February 2014, he was sacked by Swansea after a "significant" slump in the Premier League, leaving them two points above the relegation zone. Born in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, Michael Laudrup started playing football in father Finn Laudrup's childhood club Vanløse. When Finn Laudrup became player/coach of Brøndby IF in 1973, the family moved to Brøndby and both Michael and his brother Brian Laudrup started playing for the club as well. Michael followed his father to the top-flight Danish 1st Division club Københavns Boldklub in 1976, while Brian remained at Brøndby. Laudrup made his senior debut in 1981, and made his debut for the Danish under-19 national team in February 1981. Laudrup, Michael at Peders Fodboldstatistik In all, he scored a combined total of 14 goals in 25 games at various youth levels. He went back to play for Brøndby in 1982, where his father had ended his career in 1981, contributing to the promotion of Brøndby to the 1st Division. At Brøndby, Laudrup scored two goals in the club's 1st Division debut game, as fellow promoted team Boldklubben 1909 were beaten 7–1. Laudrup scored 15 league goals in 1982, and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st Division. His accomplishments earned him the 1982 Danish Player of the Year award. He played part of the 1983 season for Brøndby, and scored 9 goals, before he was sold to defending Serie A champions Juventus from Italy in June 1983. It was the biggest transfer deal in Danish football at the time, worth around $1 million. He was due to sign for Liverpool the same year on a 3-year contract, but Liverpool at the last minute changed the contract to 4 years and Laudrup decided not to join.Kvist (2001), p. 36 Under restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team, of which the club had Polish midfielder Zbigniew Boniek and Michel Platini, Juventus initially lent him to newly promoted Rome club Lazio for a single season, something that Laudrup had not been informed about before signing for Juventus. With Lazio, He scored two goals in his Serie A debut in a 2–4 loss to Verona. In his first year at the club, Lazio narrowly avoided relegation, but as Juventus wanted to keep Boniek and Platini, Laudrup had to stay for another year. Lazio started the 1984–85 season badly, and they finished dead last and were relegated to Serie B, with Laudrup scoring just a single goal that season. Laudrup returned to the Juventus side in summer 1985 to replace Zbigniew Boniek, playing alongside Michel Platini. In his first year at the club, he won the 1985–86 Serie A championship, as well as the Intercontinental Cup trophy, and Laudrup was once again named 1985 Danish Player of the Year. The following season was no success for Laudrup, who suffered multiple injuries, much like the majority of Juventus players, including Platini. When Platini retired in 1987, Laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place, playing alongside newly bought Welsh forward Ian Rush. But the 23-year-old failed to live up to Platini's standards, and did not score any goals, despite playing all 30 games of the 1987–88 season. After an unsuccessful season with Juventus, Laudrup decided it was time to leave, looking for a new experience after six years in Italy. In 1989, he joined Barcelona of Spain on the premise that Netherlands legend Johan Cruyff, Laudrup's childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. Immediately, Laudrup enjoyed major success under Cruyff's leadership, citing the Dutchman's philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. He was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside Dutch defender Ronald Koeman and Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov, who were the pillars of Barça coach Johan Cruyff's "Dream Team", along with rising stars Pep Guardiola, Bakero, and Begiristain. The Dream Team played attractive football that was comparable only to the 1970s Ajax team, and won four consecutive La Liga championships from 1991 to 1994, as well as the 1991–92 European Cup, along with the 1992 UEFA Super Cup, 1989–90 Copa del Rey, and 1991 and 1992 Supercopa de España titles. Laudrup was twice elected the best player of the year in Spain during his Barcelona years. When Barça hired a fourth foreign star player, Brazilian striker Romário in 1993 it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when Laudrup wasn't selected for the 1994 European Cup final 0–4 loss to Milan (amid conflicts with Cruyff), his time at Barcelona was over. Laudrup's departure from Barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and Laudrup's teammates alike. Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, Laudrup commented: "I think we played some very good football, and I think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world, you can have the best team. Because everybody talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe the best team in the world, together with AC Milan in that period."Sky Sports Special – Football's Greatest: Michael Laudrup. In 1994, Laudrup completed a controversial move from Barça to Real Madrid after he fell out with Johan Cruyff. On this, Laudrup stated that he did not have a hidden agenda. It was the year before the 1994 World Cup, and, according to Laudrup, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that Barcelona would not win major trophies the following season. Despite widespread belief that Laudrup joined arch rivals Real Madrid in an attempt to "get back" at Cruyff, the decision was based on the fact that Madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like Barcelona were when he decided to join them. Laudrup commented, "People say I wanted to go to Real Madrid just to get revenge. I say revenge from what? I've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [at Barcelona]. I went to Madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the World Cup. I said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win." Laudrup went on to guide Real Madrid in a championship winning season that would end the Barça stranglehold, making Laudrup the only player ever to win the Spanish league five times in a row playing for two different clubs. After the initial success at Real, a lacklustre season would be in store for the club. Despite only playing two seasons at Real Madrid, Laudrup was voted the 12th best player in Real history in an internet survey by Spanish newspaper Marca when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002. Palle "Banks" Jørgensen, "Landsholdenes 2198 profiler", Danmark, 2004, ISBN 87-89564-04-9, p. 214 While playing with Barcelona he participated in the 5–0 victory over rivals Real Madrid in the 1993–94 season. The following season while playing for Real Madrid he aided in the revenge beating that Madrid gave Barça, the final score also being 5–0. In 1996, Laudrup left Madrid to play for Vissel Kobe in Japan, helping them to promotion from the second-tier Japan Football League to the J. League Division 1. He was registered as a player in Čelik Zenica in a controversial signing in which he didn't play any games for Čelik, but was signed as a player.Laudrup var registreret i bosnisk klub SNYD: Det hollandske skattevćsen fřler sig snydt i forbindelse med Michael Laudrups skifte til Ajax - fyens.dk - Sport. fyens.dk. 23 October 2004. After the details were resolved, he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at Dutch team Ajax in 1998. Following his retirement, Laudrup sometimes turned out to play for Lyngby's Old Boys team in his spare time.Trupperne til Oldboys Landspokalfinalen. lyngby-boldklub.dk. 13 October 2005 Laudrup was called up for the Danish national team during Brøndby's debut season in the top-flight. On his 18th birthday on 15 June 1982, he became the then-second-youngest Danish national team player ever, following Harald Nielsen. Despite playing for relegation battlers Lazio, Laudrup starred for the Danish national team at the Euro 1984, playing all four matches. He took part in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6–1 defeat of Uruguay. He was also a part of the disappointing Danish national team at the Euro 1988 tournament, though Laudrup experienced personal success, scoring one of Denmark's two goals. Following three games in the qualification campaign for Euro 1992, Laudrup decided to quit the national team in November 1990, alongside brother Brian Laudrup and Jan Mølby, following differences with coach Richard Møller Nielsen."Historien om Michael Laudrups farvel", Politiken, 26 November 1990, Section:Sport, p.2 the Danes failed to qualify originally but were given Yugoslavia's place as they were kicked out due to war in their country. Laudrup, however, rated their chances so low he stayed on holiday, a decision he must have regretted as Denmark beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals with legendary keeper Peter Schmeichel surprisingly saving a Marco van Basten penalty in the shoot-out. In the final against world champions and red hot favourites Germany, the Danes stunned the world with a 2–0 win thanks to goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort, making it arguably the biggest surprise in a European Championship final. He returned to Nielsen's Danish squad in August 1993, but saw Spain and the Republic of Ireland qualify for the 1994 World Cup ahead of Denmark. He scored a goal in the 2–0 victory against Argentina, as Denmark won the 1995 Intercontinental Cup. He also scored four goals in 10 games as Denmark qualified for the Euro 1996, though the tournament would leave no positives for him. His last games for Denmark came at the 1998 World Cup, when he captained the nation to the quarter-final. Laudrup made his 100th appearance for Denmark in the team's opening game of the tournament; a 1–0 defeat of Saudi Arabia in Lens. Denmark was defeated 2–3 by Brazil in the quarter-finals, and both Michael and Brian Laudrup announced their international retirement following the World Cup elimination. Both brothers ended their international careers on a high note as both Michael and Brian were named in FIFA's All-Star Team. A quick, intelligent and talented play-making midfielder, Laudrup was known as one of the most effective attacking midfielders, as well as one of the most skilful and elegant players of the game. Laudrup is considered by many as one of the best passers and as one of the most technically accomplished players ever. He was ranked among the best players in Europe, with the French three time European footballer of the year award winner Michel Platini describing him as one of the most talented players ever, only lamenting his lack of selfishness causing him to score too few goals.Frits Ahlstrøm, Laudrup is greatest Dane, UEFA, 29 March 2004 Despite being primarily a creative team player, he also possessed an accurate shot. In a 2006 interview, Laudrup's Real Madrid team-mate Raúl called him the best player he had ever played with."Kongesønnens bøn: Kom til Madrid", Ekstra Bladet, 16 April 2006 His Barcelona team-mate Romário has stated the same, opining that he was able to create and score goals almost at will, and ranked him the fifth best player in the history of the game (behind Pelé, Diego Maradona, himself and Zinedine Zidane). Laudrup was known for his good conduct on the pitch and he never received a red card in his career. Throughout his career, Laudrup was acclaimed for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep passes and dribbling ability. In regard to his vision, Jorge Valdano, the Argentinian coach of Laudrup in Real Madrid, said "he has eyes everywhere." His trademark move – looking one way and passing the other – fooled countless opponents during his career. The Laudrup dribble was perhaps the best-known part of his game, as he quickly moved the ball from one foot to the other away from the defender. His skills were combined with creativity. This led to the expression "Made in Laudrup," widely used in Spain about his creative style of play. Numerous teammates of Laudrup have said, "Just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball." In Barcelona, he played alongside Hristo Stoichkov, who scored many goals from Laudrup's passes, like Iván Zamorano (who called Laudrup el genio, the genius) during Laudrup's time at Real Madrid. Zamorano was going through a hard spell in Madrid, but when Laudrup arrived to assist his goals, Zamorano immediately became pichichi—top scorer of the Spanish league, La Liga. Throughout his career his number of assists was almost always the highest of his team. Despite his reputation as a technical and creative player, certain players, pundits and managers have questioned his work rate and consistency at times. After his playing career ended with Ajax, Laudrup became a coach at age 36 when he started serving as an assistant coach for the Danish national team coach Morten Olsen in 2000. The national team would play a 4–2–3–1 formation, depending on two fast wingers and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game. Together they led Denmark to the knock-out stage of the 2002 World Cup. After his success as Denmark assistant manager, Laudrup signed on as manager for Danish Superliga club Brøndby. As his assistant coach, Laudrup paired up with former Danish championship winning manager John Jensen, who had played alongside him in the Danish national team. At the start of his reign, Laudrup proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which Olsen and he had coached at the national team. Laudrup renovated the Brøndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave, in favour of several new offensive players, and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club's youth scheme. To ensure the defensive strength of the team, Laudrup signed proven national team player Morten Wieghorst. He began his reign as Brøndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career, the 2002 Danish Supercup. In his first season as head coach, he guided the team to win the Danish Cup, after Brøndby beat Midtjylland 3–0 in the final and runners-up in the Danish Superliga. Laudrup's success led him to being voted and awarded the Danish Manager of the Year. In the following season, he again finished the season runners-up to first place Copenhagen by just one point. However, he would not be denied in the 2004–05 season, where he finally led the team to the Danish Superliga title. In the same season, he also completed The Double after he won his second Danish Cup in four seasons. This saw him being given his second Danish Manager of the Year award. After finishing runners-up in the 2005–06 Danish Superliga, Laudrup announced that he, along with assistant Faxe Jensen, could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. The pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left Brøndby in June 2006.Laudrup leaving Brondby, Fox Sports, 22 May 2006 Laudrup was associated with several new jobs, including becoming manager of former club Real Madrid and that he would replace Lars Lagerbäck as head coach of the Swedish national team. In 2007, Brøndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium "The Michael Laudrup Lounge," with Laudrup's approval. Laudrup's success led him to being voted and awarded the Danish Manager of the Year. On 21 June 2007, he was linked to a move to Madrid-based La Liga club Getafe by sports newspaper Marca. This was confirmed on 9 July 2007. During his stay in Getafe, the club reached the final of the Copa del Rey, losing to Valencia, and the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup, losing in extra time to Bayern Munich. During his tenure as successor to Bernd Schuster, he brought in a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to the club, bringing back memories of Laudrup as a player. His team, which was not one of the established powers in Spanish football, enjoyed comparative success. However, he performed only one season as manager, tendering his resignation in May 2008. After Laudrup announced his departure from Getafe he was linked with jobs at Barcelona, Valencia, Benfica, Chelsea, Blackburn Rovers, Panathinaikos, CSKA Moscow and West Ham United. He almost got the job at Panathinaikos, but according to Danish media, he wanted an option to allow him to leave if he received an offer from a Spanish club. This request was not accepted by the Greeks, who chose to hire Henk ten Cate instead. On 12 September 2008, it was officially announced that Laudrup signed a one-and-a-half-year contract to manage Spartak Moscow, replacing Stanislav Cherchesov following his dismissal after a string of poor results.Spartak turn to Laudrup, The Guardian, 12 September 2008 However, Laudrup started on a bad note, winning just one of his first four league matches. He was subsequently sacked on 15 April 2009, just just seven months on the job,Michael Laudrup sacked by Spartak Moscow, The Telegraph, 16 April 2009 in the wake of Spartak's quarter-final 3–0 loss to Dynamo Moscow in the Russian Cup. The official statement from Spartak read, "From this point onwards, head coach Michael Laudrup has been relieved of his responsibilities because of unsatisfactory results."Spartak Moscow fires coach Michael Laudrup, CBC News, 16 April 2009 On 22 October 2009, Spanish media announced that Laudrup would be appointed as new manager of Spanish side Atlético Madrid, replacing the short and unsuccessful run of Abel Resino, following Atletico's 4–0 Champions League defeat at the hands of Chelsea. Laudrup and the club, however, were not able to agree on terms and the deal fell apart. The day after, on 23 October, Resino was sacked and Quique Sánchez Flores was appointed as coach as second choice instead of Laudrup. In July 2010, Laudrup was appointed manager of Mallorca on a contract lasting until the end of June 2012. In his first season in Mallorca, Laudrup kept a struggling Mallorca team from relegation, which was suffering from losing many first team players and who was ejected from the Europa League due to a bad financial situation. At the beginning of the 2011–12 season, on 27 September 2011, Laudrup resigned from his job following the firing of his assistant, Erik Larsen. Laudrup cited that great frustration with Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, the club's director of football, leading to a bad work climate as the main reason for his resignation. On 15 June 2012, Laudrup was appointed manager of Swansea City on a two-year contract, becoming the first Dane to manage in the Premier League. Laudrup made several new signings after arriving at Liberty Stadium, including Michu, Chico Flores, Pablo Hernández, Jonathan de Guzmán and Ki Sung-yueng. His first competitive match as Swansea manager came as an impressive 0–5 away win at Loftus Road against Queens Park Rangers. At Swansea, Alan Tate said that Laudrup was considered to be the best player in training, despite being 48 years old. He has been commended for his choice of signings, most notably with Michu, who scored 14 goals in 2012 for Swansea after Laudrup signed him for a bargain €2.5 million from Rayo Vallecano. On 23 January 2013, Laudrup led Swansea into their first ever major Cup final after defeating reigning European champions Chelsea 2–0 on aggregate over two legs in the League Cup semi-finals. On 7 February 2013, Laudrup appointed former Danish international midfielder Morten Wieghorst as his assistant after previously signing him as a player when he was managing Brøndby. Laudrup would later say that he "certainly" believes that Wieghorst "can be manager" of Swansea, as "he has experience from Scottish football and is familiar with English football." On 24 February, Laudrup said that he had no "ambition to become the manager" of a big club, because he could not "have done everything for 10 years" in management and then be fired "after nine months" for not winning any trophies. He also said that it gave him "much more pleasure to see how well" he could do where he did not "have to win all the time." On 24 February 2013, Laudrup won his first trophy with Swansea after his side beat Bradford City 5–0 to win the Football League Cup at Wembley. This was also Swansea's first major trophy in club history. After the match, he said, "I'm very proud of my team today. I think it was a great performance." He also hailed the win as the best in his managerial career, saying, "As a manager it's absolutely at the top, winning a trophy for the first time in 100 years." Following Swansea's 1–0 win over Newcastle United on 2 March 2013 and the club moving into eighth position in the top-half of the Premier League table and seemingly safe from relegation with 40 points and ten games left, Laudrup told that he wanted Swansea to finish eighth, saying that it would be "incredible" and that "coming eighth [will be] like winning the league" for the club. Because he felt "the first seven spots" were already taken by Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton. On 3 March, though Laudrup had said that his "intention" was "to stay" in south Wales for the next year, Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said that the club were in the "process of looking for the next manager" of the club in case Laudrup did choose to leave the club. On 8 March 2013, Laudrup signed a new contract with Swansea, keeping him at the club until 2015. Reports indicated that Laudrup agreed to a contract with a release clause in the region of £5 million, much like the release clause Brendan Rodgers agreed to when he signed a contract extension at the Liberty Stadium four months prior to joining Liverpool. On 10 May, however, Laudrup confirmed that his "intention" was to stay at Swansea "next season," saying that reports he wanted to leave Wales was "pure speculation." On 4 February 2014, Laudrup was sacked by Swansea following a poor run of form which left the club two points clear of relegation. At the time of the decision, the team had lost six out of their last eight league games.  On 30 June 2014, Laudrup became the new manager of Qatar Stars League champions Lekhwiya after signing a one-year deal. He guided the Lekhwiya to a club-record Qatar Stars League and a Crown Prince Cup double in his first season. The club also qualified for the quarter finals of the 2015 AFC Champions League during his reign. On 17 June 2015, Laudrup announced that he would not extend his contract, departing the club.  As assistant manager to Morten Olsen, Denmark employed a 4–2–3–1 system with pacey wingers playing the pivotal role in attack. Laudrup learnt from Olsen and used the same tactical style with Brøndby, with the team becoming more attacking and focused on a short passing style. He continued to employ a similar tactical style when he joined Getafe, ushering a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football, to help the club to the Copa del Rey final. However, at Spartak Moscow, he could not adapt his formation and tactics to the Russian game with the team unable to score enough goals per match. As Mallorca manager, Laudrup inspired a team that lost a number of key players from relegation by playing an offensive game. In 2012, Laudrup joined Swansea City as manager, replacing Brendan Rodgers. Under Rodgers, Swansea were known to play a 4–3–3 approach with a lot of focus on passing, where the full-backs pushed up when in possession and the outfield players played a high tempo pressing game. Under Laudrup, the team began employing a 4–2–3–1 formation, becoming more attacking while retaining the passing and pressing game. He also signed a number of new players, primarily from La Liga, trying to bring the attacking style from Spain to Wales, which saw more goals scored. Laudrup said, "You can get a lot of quality for a reasonable amount in Spain right now." Laudrup earned plaudits for maintaining their flowing, attacking brand of football and attractive, passing style of play throughout the season, which saw his side win the League Cup, after beating Bradford City a record 5–0 in the final. "You can't ask players to do things that Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are doing, but you can ask the easy things," he said. "Sometimes the easiest things in football, a simple pass five or eight yards, can be the most effective. That, everybody can learn." Michael Laudrup is part of a family with three generations of footballers. His uncle is former Brøndby and Aberdeen manager Ebbe Skovdahl. He is the son of former Danish national team player Finn Laudrup and Michael's oldest son Mads Laudrup has been the team captain of various Danish youth national teams since January 2005, and his youngest son Andreas Laudrup was selected a part of the under-16 national team in March 2006.Thomas Møller Johansen, "Laudrup d. V", B.T. article, 11 March 2006 Michael Laudrup has a younger brother, Brian Laudrup, who was also a footballer. Brian Laudrup is the record holder of Danish player of the year awards with four, »Naturlig anfører« vinder titlen som årets danske fodboldspiller. Politiken.dk (2012-01-01).

Brian Laudrup was in the Euro 92 Team of the Tournament and World Cup 98 Team of the Tournament. Brian was also known for his part in the Rangers squad which won nine consecutive titles in the 1990s. Brian was a part of the trophy-winning Danish national team at UEFA Euro 1992, but Michael did not play in that championship due to differences with the national team coach Richard Møller NielsenKvist (2001), p. 155 and because he thought that the barring of Yugoslavia for political, rather than football, reasons was not just. In 2004, both the Laudrup brothers were named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by Pelé as part of the celebration of FIFA's 100th anniversary. Laudrup is married to Siw Retz Laudrup. But with his ex-girlfriend Tina Thunø, he had his elder son, Mads. With his wife Siw Retz Laudrup, he has two children, Andreas and Rebecca. Alongside his professional football career, Laudrup began importing Spanish wine to Denmark starting in 1993.

Raúl: "The best I have ever played with." Iván Zamorano: "A genius! …The reason why I make so many goals is Laudrup.""Laudrup – Et fodbolddynasti",Christian Mohr Boisen, ISBN 978-87-11-31387-9 Andrés Iniesta: "Who is the best player in history? Laudrup." Lionel Messi: "I fully understand why he is considered one of the best players in Barcelona's history and even the world." Johan Cruyff: "One of the most difficult players I have worked with. When he gives 80–90% he is still by far the best, but I want 100%, and he rarely does that.""Laudrup – Et fodbolddynasti",Christian Mohr Boisen,ISBN 978-87-11-31387-9 (After Real Madrid with Laudrup had won 5–0 over Cruyff's Barcelona): "When Michael plays like a dream, a magic illusion, determined to show his new team his extreme abilities, no one in the world comes anywhere near his level.""Laudrup – Et fodbolddynasti", Christian Mohr Boisen, ISBN 978-87-11-31387-9 "Had Michael been born in a poor ghetto in Brazil or Argentina with the ball being his only way out of poverty he would today be recognised as the biggest genius of the game ever. He had all the abilities to reach it but lacked this ghetto-instinct, which could have driven him there."Ekstra Bladet 27. august 1998 Michel Platini: "One of the biggest talents ever. The best in the world on the training pitch, but never used his talent to its fullest during matches." "Michael had everything except for one thing: he wasn't selfish enough." Pep Guardiola: "The best player in the world, I can't believe he hasn't won the title as best player." Franz Beckenbauer: "Pelé was the best in the 60s, Cruyff in the 70s, Maradona in the 80s and Laudrup in the 90s." Roberto Galia: "I have played against Maradona, Platini and Baggio. But the player I saw do the most indescribable things was Michael Laudrup." Javier Clemente: "To me, Michael Laudrup is the most genius player the world has ever seen. He will always be my numero uno. Always." José Mari Bakero: "No one has given the club [Barcelona] as much inspiration as Michael. We all look up to him. It is a privilege to have your day enriched by a genius." Ronald Koeman: "Michael was possibly the most skillful and elegant player I ever played with. Few could dribble like he could. He could sense when a game was ready to be seized and transformed by a moment of individual brilliance." Hristo Stoichkov: "One of the best European players I’ve ever seen. An elegant, old-fashioned playmaker, he did things few other footballers could do." "From more than hundred goals that I scored I'm sure that over 50 were assisted by Michael. To play with him was extremely easy. We found each other by intuition on the field and found common football language. Look at Ivan Zamorano. Laudrup went there (Real) and Zamorano is a goalscorer. Sometimes I envy Ivan for the passes he receives. Passes on foot after you accelerated. Few people understand football like the Danish player. He can only be comprised with Maradona, Schuster or Roberto Baggio. They make things easy and find the right solutions. For them is simple, for the opponent – unthinkable. Phenomenal! His only problem is his character. He is emotional and terribly reserved. This affects him a lot, because he takes everything personally – no matter if someone tells him something or decision that he does not agree. His relations with Cruyff were delicate because he couldn't take the critics. I listen to him but I don't care that much. For Michael this was fatal. He couldn't take it anymore so he left without a word." "Laudrup was the greatest." Brian Laudrup: "My brother started as an attacker but became an elegant attacking midfielder, perhaps the most complete there has ever been. His vision, speed of thought and passing were on a different level; he always knew what was going to happen before anybody else did. If anyone had a 'football brain', it was him." Albert Ferrer: "Few people made me enjoy the game as much as Michael. Maybe he didn’t get the media recognition he deserved, but he was so classy and a real thinker. A master of the blind pass and impossible through-balls and I will never forget his 'spoon' pass in a game against Osasuna. He lifted the ball right over the defence and Romario touched it in first time." Fabio Capello (after Milan's 4–0 win against Barcelona in the 1994 CL final): "Laudrup was the guy I feared but Cruyff left him out, and that was his mistake."ABC(spanish newspaper), 20 May 1994 Luís Figo: "I think maybe Laudrup was the best player I ever played against." José Mourinho: "He was phenomenal in Barcelona. He was a fantastic player whom I would love to have on my team today." Mourinho: Laudrup er fænomenal | Sportscenter. Sporten.tv2.dk (2010-07-27). Retrieved on 2015-04-18. Alan Tate: "He is still the best player in training at [age] 48 years." Ian Rush: "He probably had the most individual skill I've seen. He was an incredible player." John Toshack: "To me he was the best player of his generation, and he is a lot like Cruyff both as a player and a manager."
