Cranford has long been considered a center of commerce.  The Cranford Business Park on the south side of town consists of a complex of office buildings housing a variety of major corporations and small businesses.  Along North Avenue are a variety of buildings housing doctors and other businesses.  Law offices predominate in small buildings around town.  Banks are also extremely common throughout the township, which hosts at least half a dozen. Downtown Cranford is the main retail business district for the township.  Consisting of a variety of small family-owned businesses on both sides of the railroad tracks, there has been a debate in the community over the direction of the downtown.

On the south side of town, the Centennial Avenue Business District is a small shopping district with a mix of neighborhood stores.  There is a push to redevelop this business district.  The focus of downtown Cranford has been to recruit more restaurants into the downtown and allow for a nightlife to flourish. On the south side of the community, the Cranford Crossing redevelopment project featured retail space, apartments, and a parking deck.  The Riverfront redevelopment project on South Avenue brought in more restaurants and housing into downtown Cranford.http://www.nj.com/cranford/index.ssf/2013/05/garden_communities_launches_ri.html In the 1980s the downtown was renovated to take on a Victorian feel.  This included the installation of new light fixtures and brick sidewalks, along with decorative planters and benches.  A Victorian street clock was installed in the center of town, allowing for the creation of a small pocket park in the center of the downtown.  The clock park has become a popular hangout for teenagers who are walking to and from school.
