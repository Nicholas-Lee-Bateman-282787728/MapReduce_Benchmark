   Livermore (formerly Livermores, Livermore Ranch, and Nottingham) is a city in Alameda County, California. With an estimated 2014 population of 86,870, Livermore is the most populous city in the Tri-Valley. Livermore is located on the eastern edge of California's San Francisco Bay Area. Livermore was founded by William Mendenhall and named after Robert Livermore, his friend and a local rancher who settled in the area in the 1840s. Livermore is the home of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, for which the chemical element livermorium is named (and thus, placing the city's name in the periodic table).[ ] Livermore is also the California site of Sandia National Laboratories, which is headquartered in Alburquerque, NM. Its south side is home to local vineyards.  The city has also redeveloped its downtown district. The city is considered part of the Tri-Valley area, including Amador, Livermore and San Ramon Valleys. The Livermore Valley is located about  east of and behind the first coastal range of mountains that surround the San Francisco Bay Area. The Livermore Valley has an east-west orientation with mountain passes on the west and east connecting the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley. The passes are used by railroads and highways to connect the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley. Livermore Valley is about  long (east to west),  wide (north to south), and surrounded by California coastal range mountains and foothills. Watercourses draining the city of Livermore include Arroyo Mocho, Arroyo del Valle, Arroyo Seco and Arroyo Las Positas.  The principal aquifer underlying the city is the Mocho Subbasin.  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , over 99% of it land.  Several local seismic areas of activity lie near the city including the Greenville Fault and the Tesla Fault. The soil is primarily gravel with excellent drainage. The gravel is used in several gravel extraction sites outside the city. The gravelly soil and Mediterranean climate increases the flavor concentration in the grapes planted in the soil.  Livermore has a Mediterranean climate,Average Livermore weather [ ] accessed 20 Apr 2013 although it is close to a semi-arid climate because of its relatively low annual precipitation. It features with warm to hot, dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters (Köppen climate classification Csa). Summer (June–October) daytime temperatures average in the   to  range, but sometimes reach  and can occasionally approach . Summer nights, however, are normally much cooler, with lows in the  to  range. The valley's passes direct the normal west to east flow of air through the valley. Usually there is a strong evening wind in the summer that brings cool air off the Pacific Ocean into the Livermore valley as it heads towards the much hotter Central Valley. This wind is strong enough with an average summer wind speed of about  and predictable enough to make the Livermore hills covered with wind turbines mounted in Altamont pass. The period from June to September is extremely dry and is characterized by clear skies, but in late summer, subtropical moisture occasionally surges into the Livermore Valley, bringing high humidity, monsoon clouds, and, much less commonly, thunderstorms. Nearly all of the  of annual Livermore rainfall comes in the September to May time period, but about 50% of the days are sunny during this period with no appreciable cloud cover. The peak rainy months are December to March. Most rainstorms are classified as 50% light rain, 32% moderate rain, 11% heavy rain and less than 6% thunder showers.Livermore rainfall probabilities [ ] accessed 20 Apr 2013 The coldest months are December and January, with a mean high of about  and a low of about  with some occasional frost possible on clear mornings. The temperature can drop to as low as  to  range on an exceptionally cold night. Snow is very rare, but light dustings do occur on the surrounding hills and occasionally in the valley. The record high temperature is , recorded on September 3, 1950, and the record low temperature is , recorded on January 5, 1961 and December 9, 1972.http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca8353       Before its incorporation in 1796 under the Franciscan Mission San Jose, located in what is now the southern part of Fremont, California, the Livermore area was home to some of the Ohlone (or Costanoan) native people. Each mission had two to three friars and a contingent of up to five soldiers to help keep order in the Mission and to help control the Indians. Like most Indians in California, the Indians in the vicinity of Mission San Jose were mostly coerced into joining the Mission San José (California) where they were taught Spanish, the Catholic religion, singing, construction, agricultural trades and herding—the Native Californian Indians originally had no agriculture and no domestic animals except dogs. Other Indian tribes were coerced into other adjacent Missions. The Mission Indians were restricted to the Mission grounds where they lived in sexually segregated "barracks" that they built themselves with Padre instruction. The population of all California Missions plunged steeply as new diseases ravaged the Mission Indian populations—they had almost no immunities to these "new to them" diseases and death rates over 50% were not uncommon.Mission Indian life [ ] accessed 15 Jul 2013 The Livermore-Amador Valley after 1800 to about 1837 was primarily used as grazing land for some of the Mission San Jose's growing herds of mission cattle, sheep and horses. The herds grew wild with no fences and were culled about once a year for cow hides and tallow—essentially the only money making products produced in California then. The dead animals were left to rot or feed the California grizzly bears which then roamed California. The secularization and closure of the California missions, as demanded by the government of Mexico, from 1834 to 1837 transferred the land and property the Missions claimed on the California coast (about  per mission) to about 600 extensive Ranchos of California. After the Missions were dissolved, most of the surviving Indians went to work on the new ranchos raising crops and herding animals where they were given room and board, a few clothes and usually no pay for the work they did—the same as they had had while working in the Missions. Some Indians joined or re-joined some of the few surviving tribes. The about  Rancho Las Positas grant, which includes most of Livermore, was made to rancher Robert Livermore and Jose Noriega in 1839.Map of Rancho Los Positas [ ] accessed 28 Mar 2013There is conflicting information as to the size of Livermore and Noreiga's grant. The 1884 California surveyors report lists 8,880 acres as being approved--this is probably what the Livermore family ended up with of their original grant when it was finally patented 1872. The rancho map (circa 1840?) seems to show a larger grant than 8,880 acres. [ ] accessed 28 Mar 2013 Most land grants were given with little or no cost to the recipients. Robert Livermore (1799-1858)Robert Livermore Picture [ ] accessed 28 Mar 2013 was a British citizen who had jumped from a British merchant sailing ship stopping in Monterey, California, in 1822. He became a naturalized Mexican citizen who had converted to Catholicism in 1823 as was required for citizenship and legal residence. After working for a number of years as a majordomo (ranch foreman), Robert Livermore married on 5 May 1838 the widow Maria Josefa de Jesus Higuera (1815–1879), daughter of Jose Loreto Higuera grantee of Rancho Los Tularcitos, at the Mission San José.  Robert Livermore. after he got his rancho in 1839, was as interested in viticulture and horticulture as he was in cattle and horses despite the fact that about the only source of income was the sale of cow hides and tallow. In the early 1840s he moved his family to the Livermore valley to his new rancho as the second non-Indian family to settle in the Livermore valley area and after building a home he was the first in the area in 1846 to direct the planting of vineyards and orchards of pears and olives. Typical of most early rancho dwellings the first building on his ranch was an adobe on Las Positas Creek near the western end of today's Las Positas Road. After the Americans took control of California in 1847 and gold was discovered in 1848 he started making money by selling California longhorn cattle to the thousands of hungry California gold rush miners who soon arrived. The non-Indian population exploded and cattle were suddenly worth much more than the $1.00-$3.00 their hides could bring. With his new wealth and with goods flooding into newly rich California, in 1849 Livermore bought a two-story "Around the Horn" disassembled house that had been shipped about  on a sailing ship around Cape Horn from the east coast.  It is believed to be the first wooden building in the Livermore tri-valley. During the California Gold Rush, Livermore's ranch became a popular "first day" stopping point for prospectors and businessmen leaving San Francisco or San Jose and headed for Sacramento, California, and the Mother Lode gold country. Most horse traffic went by way of Altamont Pass just east of Livermore. Robert Livermore was a very accommodating host and welcomed nearly all that stopped by with lodging and meals. Robert Livermore died in 1858 and was buried at Mission San Jose before the establishment of the town that bears his name. His ranch included much of the present-day city. The city of Livermore, named in honor of Robert Livermore, was established in 1869 by William Mendenhall,William Mendenhall [ ] accessed 28 Mar 2013 who had first met Robert Livermore while marching through the valley with John C. Fremont's California Battalion in 1846 as they were recruited to occupy the surrendering Californio towns captured by the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron. California became the 31st state in 1850 when California's non-Indian population jumped from about 8,000 in 1846 to about 120,000 in 1850 as shown in a corrected 1850 U.S. California Census.“Historical Statistics of the United States, 1789–1945”; The California U.S. Census of 1850 showed 92,597 residents. To this should be added residents from San Francisco, (the largest city in the state) Santa Clara, and Contra Costa counties whose censuses were burned up or lost and not included in the totals. Newspaper accounts in 1850 (Alta Californian) gives the population of San Francisco at 21,000; The special California state Census of 1852 finds 6,158 residents of Santa Clara county and 2,786 residents of Contra Costa County. The corrected California U.S. 1850 Census is over 120,000. See: U.S. Seventh Census 1850: California [ ] Accessed 14 April 2011 California had enough population and enough wealth in 1850 that they by-passed the territorial status of most other states and were allowed to more or less choose their own (large) boundaries. The Livermore Ranch post office, in Robert Livermore's home, operated from 1851 to 1853. The first significant settlement of Livermore was Laddsville, on what's now Junction Avenue, which grew up around the hotel established by Alphonso Ladd in 1864. The official U.S. post office in Livermore opened in 1869. The original Western Pacific Railroad Company in 1869 built its railroad connection from Oakland, California, to Sacramento, California, over the nearby Altamont Pass in the east and Niles Canyon on the west with a stop in Livermore on land donated by William M. Mendenhall. This made Livermore a "railroad"CPRR railroad history [ ] access 28 Mar 2013 town and greatly accelerated town growth. The population of Livermore in 1869, before the railroad arrived, is thought to have been about 75Baker, Joseph Eugene; Past and present of Alameda County, California, Volume 1;p.441;[ ] By 1870 the Western Pacific had been absorbed by the Central Pacific Railroad as part of the first transcontinental railroad. Central Pacific was later acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad and then the Union Pacific Railroad which owns the tracks through town today, although these are primarily the tracks of the "second" Western Pacific Railroad that was founded in 1903 and absorbed into the UP in 1983. Private grade schools were operating in Livermore from the 1860s on. The Livermore Collegiate Institute was founded in 1870 and the Union high school (later called Livermore High) in 1896 graduated its first class of students. Petroleum was discovered near Livermore and become a valuable asset. Extensive coal deposits were mined near Corral Hollow by the Livermore Coal Company. In September 1871 Laddsville mostly burned down and the people rebuilt their homes and businesses nearer the railroad in what is now downtown Livermore. Until 1875 the townspeople enjoyed bull fights in a small bullring on many Sundays and on other occasions a captured grizzly bear might be pitted against a longhorn bull. Apparently, roping a grizzly was thought then to be a great sport. As the town grew there were a fire company, churches, a bank and a library that were formed by 1876. Livermore was officially incorporated by the state as a city on April 15, 1876, its original city limits being the line a block north of 1st Street on the north & Livermore Avenue (then Lizzie Street) on the east.  The part of the west side north of 5th Street was bounded by Q Street & the part of it south of 5th Street by I Street.

Livermore after the 1880s is also notable for the Wente Vineyards, Concannon Vineyard, Cresta Blanca Winery and Livermore's many other wineries. Since it has a Mediterranean climate, gravely soil, warm days and cool nights it was a good location to grow wine grapes. By 1880 the extensive winter wheat and hay crop lands were being replaced by vineyards. Extensive chromite deposits were found and exploited for a time. In 1885 the Remillard Brick Company was producing an extensive line of bricks and employing over 100 men. A telephone line connected Livermore to Arroyo Valley by 1886 and electric lights were introduced by 1889.

In 1942, the U. S. government bought  of ranch land, bounded by Vasco and Greenville roads and East Avenue, and built the Livermore Naval Air Station. The primary mission of the base was to train Navy pilots. This facility operated until it was decommissioned in 1946 after the end of World War II. On 5 January 1951, the Bureau of Yards and Docks, U.S. Navy, formally transferred the former NAS Livermore in its entirety to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for use by the University of California's Radiation Laboratory. In 1952, the government established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), named after famous physicist Ernest O. Lawrence, as the site of a second laboratory for the study of nuclear energy like the research being done at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The laboratory was run by the University of California. Edward Teller was a co-founder of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and was both its director and associate director for many years.Livermore Naval Air Station Website.

The laboratories are known worldwide, and attract significant attention both for their scientific research and for their major roles in developing the United States nuclear arsenal.  The largest employer in Livermore is the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), a federally funded research and development center funded by the Department of Energy which is operated by a limited liability consortium named Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS), a joint venture company of Bechtel National, the University of California, BWX Technologies, URS, and Battelle. The lab is the location of the IBM Sequoia supercomputer. The lab was the co-discoverers of new superheavy elements 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, and 118. The chemical element with atomic number 116, previously known as ununhexium, was given the name livermorium, after the laboratory, in 2012.  LLNL is the location of the world's most powerful laser, the National Ignition Facility (NIF), a project designed to create the first sustained, controlled nuclear fusion reaction, which would generate fusion power, a potential energy source.  Livermore is also the California site of Sandia National Laboratories, which is operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed-Martin owned Company. The two National Laboratories, along with other stakeholders, including the University of California, Berkeley, UC Davis, and regional cities, partnered to create the i-GATE (Innovation for Green Advanced Transportation Excellence) National Energy Systems Technology (NEST) Incubator. The  i-GATE NEST campus was created to stimulate large-scale, high-tech business development drawn by the two labs. Initial focus of the campus will be solar energy, fuel cells, biofuels, LED lighting, and other related technologies."Campus an incubator for innovation", Jeanine Benca, (Hayward) Daily Review, July 8, 2011California selects Livermore Valley’s i-GATE as state innovation hub – Sandia Labs News Releases i-GATE shares its facilities with the hackerspace Robot Garden, which provides public access on Saturdays from 11 AM to 3 PM.Robot Garden ← Community Workshop  One of California’s oldest wine regions, the Livermore Valley American Viticultural Area (AVA) played a pivotal role in shaping California’s wine industry.
