     Old age consists of ages nearing or surpassing the life expectancy of human beings, and thus the end of the human life cycle. Euphemisms and terms for old people include, old people (worldwide usage), seniors (American usage), senior citizens (British and American usage), older adults (in the social sciencesPublication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th edition (American Psychological Association, 2009) ISBN 1433805618), the elderly, and elders (in many cultures —including the cultures of aboriginal people). Old people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more susceptible to disease, syndromes, and sickness than younger adults. The organic process of ageing is called senescence,http://www.thefreedictionary.com/senescence the medical study of the aging process is gerontology,http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gerontology and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is geriatrics.http://www.thefreedictionary.com/geriatrics The elderly also face other social issues such as retirement, loneliness, and ageism.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24572231 The chronological age denoted as "old age" varies culturally and historically. Thus, old age is "a social construct" rather than a definite "biological stage".Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science & Medicine, s.v. "old age".

Definitions of old age include official definitions, popular definitions, sub-group definitions, and four dimensions as follows. Old age comprises "the later part of life; the period of life after youth and middle age . . . , usually with reference to deterioration""old age, n.". Oxford English Dictionary Online. September 2013. Oxford University Press. http://0-www.oed.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/view/Entry/258473?redirectedFrom=old+age& (accessed December 02, 2013). When old age begins cannot be universally defined because it shifts according to the context. The United Nations has agreed that 60+ years may be usually denoted as old age,http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageingdefnolder/en/ (Accessed December 24, 2013. and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age. However, for its study of old age in Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) set 50 as the beginning of old age. At the same time, the WHO recognized that the developing world often defines old age, not by years, but by new roles, loss of previous roles, or inability to make active contribution to society.“Indicators for the Minimum Data Set Project on Ageing,” http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageing_mds_report_en_daressalaam.pdf. Most developed Western countries set the age of 60 to 65 for retirement and old-age social programs eligibility. However, various countries and societies consider the onset of old age as anywhere from the mid-40s to the 70s.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/426737/old-age Furthermore, the fact that life expectancy beyond 80 has become widespread has shifted definitions of old age.The Robert N. Butler Columbia Aging Center, “About Us.” http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/centers/columbia-aging/about-us.(accessed December 24, 2013. A Pew Research Center study of 2,929 Americans, age 18+, found that they hold very different definitions of old age. Respondents up to their early 30's said that old age begins at 60, but respondents 65+ said 74. The average of all answers was 68.Pew Research Center, “Growing Old in America: Expectations vs. Reality,”  http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/Getting-Old-in-America.pdf Most Britons define old age as starting at 59 according to a survey of 2,200 people in the UK. The under 25s reckon 54 as the beginning of old age. The 80+ define old age as starting at 68.“Old age starts at 54 (and youth ends at 32) - that's if you ask young people” at http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2086030/Old-age-starts-54-youth-ends-32.html.

Gerontologists have recognized the very different conditions that people experience as they grow older within the years defined as old age. In developed countries, most people in their 60s and early 70s are still fit, active, and able to care for themselves.Laura E. Berk, Development Through the Lifespan, (Allyn & Bacon, 2010), 607.

Accessed December 3, 2013. Therefore, rather than lumping together all people who have been defined as old, some gerontologists have recognized the diversity of old age by defining sub-groups. One study distinguishes the young old (60 to 69), the middle old (70 to 79), and the very old (80+). Another study’s sub-grouping is young-old (65 to 74), middle-old (75–84), and oldest-old (85+). A third sub-grouping is “young old” (65-74), “old” (74-84), and "old-old" (85+).Transgenerational design Matters, “Characteristics of our Aging Population: The Elderly Sub-Population” online at ref>http://transgenerational.org/aging/demographics.htm.

Cicirelli, Older Adults' Views on Death (Springer, 2002), 4. Two British scholars, Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, have added a “fourth age” sub-group. In British English, the “third age” is “the period in life of active retirement, following middle age”.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. “third age”. Higgs and Gilleard describe the fourth age as “an arena of inactive, unhealthy, unproductive, and ultimately unsuccessful ageing.”Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, Rethinking Old Age: Theorizing the Fourth Age (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), vii, 119-120.

Accessed November 20, 2013. In addition to chronological age, people can be considered old because of the other dimensions of old age. For example, people may be considered old when they become grandparents or when they begin to do less or different work in retirement."WHO" Senior citizen is a common euphemism for an old person used in American English, and sometimes in British English. It implies or means that the person being referred to is retired.http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.plhttp://www.bartleby.com/61/36/S0263600.htmlhttp://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=senior+citizen&title=21sthttp://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=71747&dict=CALD This in turn usually implies or in fact means that the person is over the retirement age, which varies according to country. Synonyms include old age pensioner or pensioner in British English, and retiree and senior in American English. Some dictionaries describe widespread usage of "senior citizen" for people over the age of 65.http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/senior-citizen When defined in an official context, senior citizen is often used for legal or policy-related reasons in determining who is eligible for certain benefits available to the age group. It is used in general usage instead of traditional terms such as old person, old-age pensioner, or elderly as a courtesy and to signify continuing relevance of and respect for this population group as "citizens" of society, of senior rank.https://books.google.com/books?id=xylg46v5fRUC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64 Mental Health Concepts by Claire G. Waughfield, Teresa S. Burckhalter The term was apparently coined in 1938 during a political campaign.http://www.theseniortimes.com/richler.htm The Senior Times Famed caricaturist Al Hirschfeld claimed on several occasion that his father Isaac Hirschfeld invented the term 'senior citizen'.    It has come into widespread use in recent decades in legislation, commerce, and common speech. Especially in less formal contexts, it is often abbreviated as "senior(s)", which is also used as an adjective. In commerce, some businesses offer customers of a certain age a "senior discount". The age at which these discounts are available vary between 55, 60, 62 or 65, and other criteria may also apply. Sometimes a special "senior discount card" or other proof of age needs to be obtained and produced to show entitlement. The age which qualifies for senior citizen status varies widely. In governmental contexts it is usually associated with an age at which pensions or medical benefits for the elderly become available. In commercial contexts, where it may serve as a marketing device to attract customers, the age is often significantly lower.http://www.seriworld.org/01/wldContVod.html?mn=A&mncd=0301&sort=A&gubun=00&p_page=65&natcd=KR&key=20110404000005 In the United States, the standard retirement age is currently 66 (gradually increasing to 67).http://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/ageincrease.html In Canada, the OASP (Old Age Security Pension) is available at 65 (gradually increasing to 67, starting in the period 2023-2029),http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/isp/oas/changes/index.shtml and the CPP (Canada Pension Plan) as early as age 60. The AARP allows couples in which one spouse has reached the age of 50 to join, regardless of the age of the other spouse. The distinguishing marks associated with old age comprise both physical and mental characteristics. The marks of old age are so unlike the marks of middle age that it has been suggested that, as an individual transitions into old age, he/she might well be thought of as different persons “time-sharing” the same identity.Richard A. Posner, Aging and Old Age (University of Chicago, 1997), 86-87. These marks do not occur at the same chronological age for everyone. Also, they occur at different rates and order for different people.“When Does Someone Attain Old Age?” at http://ohioline.osu.edu/ss-fact/0101.html. Accessed November 20, 2013 Because each person is unique, marks of old age vary between people, even those of the same chronological age.“Ageing: Myth and Reality” (The Department of Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services, Australia, 2012) 12-13 at http://www.communities.qld.gov.au/resources/communityservices/seniors/publications/ageing-myth-reality.pdf.

A basic mark of old age that affects both body and mind is “slowness of behavior.” This “slowing down principle” finds a correlation between advancing age and slowness of reaction and task performance, both physical and mental.Donald H. Kausler and Barry C. Kausler, The Graying of America: An Encyclopedia of Aging, Health, Mind, and Behavior (University of Illinois, 2001), 376-377.

The literature regarding old age includes perceptions of old age from a middle-age perspective, from an old-age perspective, from society’s perspective, and from a simulated perspective. Numerous books by middle-age writers depict their perceptions of old people.How to Survive Your Aging Parents (Surrey, 2001); Are Your Parents Driving You Crazy? (Vanderwyk & Burnham, 2005); Coping With Your Difficult Older Parent: A Guide for Stressed-Out Children (William Morrow, 1999); Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents: How to Help, How to Survive (Holt, 2005); The Caregiver's Survival Handbook: Caring for Your Aging Parents Without Losing Yourself (Perigee, 2011). One writer notices the change in his parents: they move slowly, they have lost strength, they repeat stories, their minds wander, and they fret.David Solie, How to Say It to Seniors: Closing the Communication Gap with Our Elders (Prentice Hall, 2004) , 2. Another writer sees her aged parents and is bewildered: they refuse to follow her advice, they are obsessed with the past, they avoid risk, they live at a “glacial pace.”Connie Matthiessen, Caring.com Senior Editor, “Demystifying Your Aging Parents' New Stage of Life,” http://www.caring.com/articles/elderly-communication. Accessed February 17, 2014. Other writers treat the perceptions of  middle-age people regarding their own old age. In her The Denial of Aging, Dr. Muriel R. Gillick, a baby boomer, accuses her contemporaries of believing that by proper exercise and diet they can avoid the scourges of old age and proceed from middle age to death.Gillick, The Denial of Aging: Perpetual Youth, Eternal Life, and Other Dangerous Fantasies (Harvard, 2007), 5-6. Studies find that many people in the 55-75 range can postpone morbidity by practicing healthy life styles. These discourses take part in a general idea of successful ageing. However, at about age 80, all people experience similar morbidity.Waneen Wyrick Spirduso, Karen L. Francis, Priscilla G. MacRae, Physical Dimensions of Aging (Human Kinetics, 2004), 26. Even with healthy life styles, most 85+ people will undergo extended “frailty and disability.”Susan Jacoby, Never Say Die: The Myth and Marketing of the New Old Age (Pantheon, 2011), 12. Early old age is a pleasant time: children are grown, retirement from work, time to pursue interests.Laura E. Berk, Development Through the Lifespan (Allyn & Bacon, 2010), 603. Many people are also willing to get involved in community and activist organizations to promote their well-being. In contrast, perceptions of old age by writers 80+ years old (“old age in the real meaning of the term) tend to be negative. writes that the first man to talk about his old age was an Egyptian scribe who lived 4,500 years ago. The scribe addressed God with a prayer of lament:Georges Minois, History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance, trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 14. O Sovereign my Lord!  Oldness has come; old age has descended. Feebleness has arrived; dotage is here anew. The heart sleeps wearily every day. The eyes are weak, the ears are deaf, the strength is disappearing because of weariness of the heart and the mouth is silent and cannot speak. The heart is forgetful and cannot recall yesterday. The bone suffers old age. God is become evil. All taste is gone. What old age does to men is evil in every respect.Georges Minois, History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance, trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989) Minois, 14-15. Minois comments that the scribe’s “cry shows that nothing has changed in the drama of decrepitude between the age of the Pharaoh and the atomic age” and “expresses all the anguish of old people in the past and the present.”Georges Minois, History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance, trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 14. Lillian Rubin, active in her 80s as an author, sociologist, and psychotherapist, opens her book 60 on Up: The Truth about Aging in America with “getting old sucks. It always has, it always will.” Dr. Rubin contrasts the “real old age” with the “rosy pictures” painted by middle-age writers.Lillian B. Rubin, 60 on Up: The Truth About Aging in America (Beacon, 2007), 1, 7-8. Writing at the age of 87, Mary C. Morrison delineates the heroism required by old age: to live through the disintegration of one’s own body or that of someone you love. Morrison concludes, “old age is not for the fainthearted.”Mary C. Morrison, Let Evening Come (1998), 2-3. In the book Life Beyond 85 Years, the 150 interviewees had to cope with physical and mental debilitation and with losses of loved ones. One interviewee described living in old age as “pure hell.”Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, Life Beyond 85 Years (Prometheus, 2003), 7-8, 208. Based on his survey of old age in history,  concludes that “it is clear that always and everywhere youth has been preferred to old age.” In western thought, “old age is an evil, an infirmity and a dreary time of preparation for death.” Furthermore, death is often preferred over “decrepitude, because death means deliverance.”Georges Minois, History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance, trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 303. “The problem of the ambiguity of old age has . . . been with us since the stage of primitive society; it was both the source of wisdom and of infirmity, experience and decrepitude, of prestige and suffering.”Georges Minois, History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance, trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 11. In the Classical period of Greek and Roman cultures, old age was denigrated as a time of “decline and decrepitude.”Susan M. Hillier and Georgia M. Barrow, Aging, The Individual & Society (Cengage, 10th edition, 2014), 6-7. “Beauty and strength” were esteemed and old age was viewed as defiling and ugly. Old age was reckoned as one of the unanswerable “great mysteries” along with evil, pain, and suffering. “Decrepitude, which shrivels heroes, seemed worse than death.”Georges Minois, History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance, trans.

Online at http://www.answers.com/topic/old-age “Old people were respected or despised, honoured or put to death according to circumstance.” Ancient times In ancient times, the very few people who lived beyond 35 physically and mentally healthy, especially those of social status and wealth, were treated with “respect and awe.” In contrast, those who were frail were seen as a burden and ignored or in extreme cases killed. People were defined as “old” because of their inability to perform useful tasks rather than their years.Paul Johnson and Pat Thane, editors, Old Age from Antiquity to Post-Modernity (Routledge, 1998), 6.

In his Ethics, he wrote that “old people are miserly; they do not acknowledge disinterested friendship; only seeking for what can satisfy their selfish needs.”Georges Minois, History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance, trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 60. Medieval and Renaissance periods The 16th century utopians, Thomas More and Antonio de Guevara allowed no decrepit old people in their fictional lands.Georges Minois, History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance, trans.

For Thomas More, on the island of Utopia, when people are so old as to have “out-lived themselves” and are terminally ill, in pain, and a burden to everyone, the priests exhort them about choosing to die. The priests assure them that “they shall be happy after death.” If they choose to die, they end their lives by starvation or by taking opium.Thomas More, Utopia (Planet PDF eBook), 126-127. Online at http://history-world.org/Utopia_T.pdf. Antonio de Guevara’s utopian nation “had a custom, not to live longer than sixty five years.” At that age, they practiced self-immolation.

Modern period In the Modern period, the “cultural status” of old people has declined in many cultures. Joan Erikson observed that “aged individuals are often ostracized, neglected, and overlooked; elders are seen no longer as bearers of wisdom but as embodiments of shame.”Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version (W. W. Norton, 1998), 114. Research on age-related attitudes consistently finds that negative attitudes exceed positive attitudes toward old people because of their looks and behavior.James E.

The young are “consistent in their negative attitude” toward the old.Mahzarin R. Banaji and Anthony G. Greenwald, Blind Spot: Hidden Biases of Good People (Random House, 2013), 67. Ageism documents that Americans generally have “little tolerance for older persons and very few reservations about harboring negative attitudes” about them.Todd D. Nelson, ed, Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons (Bradford, 2004), ix. In spite of its prevalence, ageism is seldom the subject of public discourse.Judith E Phillips and others, Key Concepts in Social Gerontology (Sage, 2010), 23. In 2014, a documentary film called The Age of Love used humor and poignant adventures of 30 seniors who attend a speed dating event for 70- to 90-year-olds, and discovered how the search for romance changes; or does not change; from a childhood sweetheart to older age. Simone de Beauvoir wrote that “there is one form of experience that belongs only to those that are old – that of old age itself.”Simone de Beauvoir, The Coming of Age, trans by Patrick O'Brian (Norton, 1996), 381. Nevertheless, simulations of old age attempt to help younger people gain some understanding. Texas A&M University offers a plan for a “Aging Simulation” workshop.Texas A&M AgriLife Extension, “Aging Simulation: Sensitizing People to the Process of Aging” online at http://fcs.tamu.edu/files/2015/06/aging-simulation.pdf. The workshop is adapted from Sensitizing People to the Processes of Aging.Sensitizing People to the Processes of Aging: The In-Service Educator’s Guide by Marvin Ernst and Herbert Shore, Dallas Geriatric Research Institute, 1977. Some of the simulations follow: * Sight: Wearing swimmer’s goggles with black paper pasted to lens with only a small hole to simulate tunnel vision, * Hearing: Use ear plugs to dull the sound of people talking. * Touch: Wearing thick gloves, button a shirt or buckle a belt. * Dexterity: With tape around several fingers, unscrew a jar lid. * Mobility and Balance: Carry packages in one hand while using a walker.

A condensed version was presented on  NBC’s Today Show and is available online.http://www.today.com/video/today/27336610#27336610. One exercise was to lay out 3 sets of 5 slips of paper. On set #1, write your 5 most enjoyed activities; on set #2, write your 5 most valued possessions; on set #3, write your 5 most loved people. Then “lose” them one by one, trying to feel each loss, until you have lost them all as happens in old age.  Most people in the age range of 60-80 (the years of retirement and early old age), enjoy rich possibilities for a full life, but the condition of frailty distinguished by “bodily failure” and greater dependence becomes increasingly after that.Tor Inge Romoren, Last Years of Long Lives: The Larvik Study (Routledge, 2003), 170. In the United States, hospital discharge data from 2003-2011 shows that injury was the common reason for hospitalization among patient aged 65+. Gerontologists note the lack of research regarding and the difficulty in defining frailty. However, they add that physicians recognize frailty when they see it.Patricia M. Burbank, editor, Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions (Springer, 2006), xxi, 4, 6. A group of geriatricians proposed a general definition of frailty as “a physical state of increased vulnerability to stressorsStressor: Any deleterious force brought to bear on a bodily system that impairs its function. http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/stressors that results from decreased reserves and disregulationDysregulation: impairment of a physiological regulatory mechanism (as that governing metabolism, immune response, or organ function). http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/dysregulation. in multiple physiological systems.”Patricia M. Burbank, ed., Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions (Springer, 2006), 20. Frailty is a common condition in later old age, but different definitions of frailty produce diverse assessments of prevalence. One study placed the incidence of frailty for ages 65+ at 10.7%. Another study placed the incidence of frailty in age 65+ population at 22% for women and 15% for men.Muriel R. Gillick M.D., Choosing Medical Care in Old Age: What Kind, How Much, When to Stop (Harvard, 1998), 106. A Canadian study illustrated how frailty increases with age and calculated the prevalence for 65+ as 22.4% and for 85+ as 43.7%.Laurie Barclay, “Prevalence of Frailty Increases Throughout Adulthood.” http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/741960. Accessed January 14, 2014. A worldwide study of “patterns of frailty” based on data from 20 nations found (a) a consistent correlation between frailty and age, (b) a higher frequency among women, and (c) more frailty in wealthier nations where greater support and medical care increases longevity. In Norway, a 20-year longitudinal study of 400 people found that bodily failure and greater dependence became prevalent in the 80+ years. The study calls these years the “fourth age” or “old age in the real meaning of the term.” Similarly, the “Berlin Aging Study” rated over-all functionality on four levels: good, medium, poor, and very poor. People in their 70s were mostly rated good. In the 80-90 year range, the four levels of functionality were divided equally. By the 90-100 year range, 60% would be considered frail because of very poor functionality and only 5% still possessed good functionality. In the United States, the 85+ age group is the fastest growing, a group that is almost sure to face the “inevitable decrepitude” of survivors.Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, Life Beyond 85 Years (Prometheus, 2003), 3. (Frailty and decrepitude are synonyms.http://thesaurus.yourdictionary.com/frailty) Three unique markers of frailty have been proposed: (a) loss of any notion of invincibility, (b) loss of ability to do things essential to one’s care, and (c) loss of possibility for a subsequent life stage.Nortin M. Hadler, Rethinking Aging: Growing Old and Living Well in an Overtreated Society (University of North Carolina, 2011), 159-160. http://www.amazon.com/Nortin-M.-Hadler/e/B001ITYO36. Old age survivors on-average deteriorate from agility in their 65-80s to a period of frailty preceding death. This deterioration is gradual for some and precipitous for others. Frailty is marked by an array of chronic physical and mental problems which means that frailty is not treatable as a specific disease. These problems coupled with increased dependency in the basic activities of daily living (ADLs) required for personal care add emotional problems: depression and anxiety.Muriel R. Gillick, Lifelines: Living Longer, Growing Frail, Taking Heart (Norton, 2001), x, xv-xvi, 5-6. In sum, frailty has been depicted as a group of “complex issues,” distinct but “causally interconnected,” that often include “comorbid diseases,”,“diseases in addition to the primary disease” progressive weakness, stress, exhaustion, and depression.Patricia M. Burbank, ed., Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions (Springer, 2006), 25-26. Johnson and Barer did a pioneering study of  Life Beyond 85 Years by interviews over a six-year period. In talking with 85+ year olds, they found some popular conceptions about old age to be erroneous. Many studies of old age overlook the 85+ survivors so their conclusions do not apply. Such erroneous conceptions include (1) people in old age have a least one family member for support, (2) old age well-being requires social activity, and (3) “successful adaptation” to age-related changes demands a continuity of self-concept. In their interviews, Johnson and Barer found that 24% of the 85+ had no face-to-face family relationships; many have outlived their families. Second, that contrary to popular notions, the interviews revealed that the reduced activity and socializing of the over 85s does not harm their well-being; they “welcome increased detachment.” Third, rather than a continuity of self-concept, as the interviewees faced new situations they changed their “cognitive and emotional processes” and reconstituted their “self–representation.”Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, Life Beyond 85 Years (Prometheus, 2003), 5-6. Frail people require a high level of care. Medical advances have made it possible to “postpone death” for years.

Burbank, editor, Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions (Springer, 2006), 9. According to a study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the rate of ED visits was consistently highest among patients ages 85 years and older in 2006-2011 in the United States. Additionally, patients aged 65+ had the highest percentage of hospital stays for adults with multiple chronic conditions but the second highest percentage of hospital costs in 2003-2014. These final years are also costly in economic terms.Barbara Logue, Last Rights: Death Control and the Elderly in America (Lexington Books/Macmillan, 1993), 17-18, 92.

Gillick M.D. argues that appropriate medical treatment for the frail is not the same as for the robust. The frail are vulnerable to “being tipped over” by any physical stress put on the system such as medical interventions.Muriel R. Gillick M.D., Choosing Medical Care in Old Age: What Kind, How Much, When to Stop (Harvard, 1998), 116, 189, Old age, death, and frailty are linked because approximately half the deaths in old age are preceded by months or years of frailty,Patricia M. Burbank, ed., Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions (Springer, 2006), 3, 19. Older Adults' Views on Death is based on interviews with 109 people in the 70-90 age range, with a mean age of 80.7.  Almost 20% of the people wanted to use whatever treatment that might postpone death. About the same number said that given a terminal illness, they would choose assisted suicide. Roughly half chose doing nothing except live day by day until death comes naturally without medical or other intervention designed to prolong life. This choice was coupled with a desire to receive palliative care if needed.Victor G. Cicirelli, Older Adults' Views on Death (Springer, 2002), 6-7, 9, 12, 32. About half of older adults suffer multimorbidity, that is, they have three or more chronic conditions.Johns Hopkins Medicine, “Multimorbidity,” http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geriatric_medicine_gerontology/aging_research/health_services_research/multimorbidity.html. Accessed January 24, 2014. Medical advances have made it possible to “postpone death,” but in many cases this postponement adds “prolonged sickness, dependence, pain, and suffering,” a time that is costly in social, psychological, economic terms.Barbara Logue, Last Rights: Death Control and the Elderly in America (Lexington Books/Macmillan, 1993), 18, 72. The longitudinal interviews of 150 age 85+ people summarized in Life Beyond 85 Years found “progressive terminal decline” in the year prior to death: constant fatigue, much sleep, detachment from people, things, and activities, simplified lives. Most of the interviewees did not fear death; some would welcome it. One person said, “living this long is pure hell.” However, nearly everyone feared a long process of dying. Some wanted to die in their sleep; others wanted to die “on their feet.”Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, Life Beyond 85 Years (Prometheus, 2003), 202-207. The study of  Older Adults' Views on Death found that the more frail people were, the more “pain, suffering, and struggles” they were enduring, the more likely they were to “accept and welcome” death as a release from their misery. Their fear about the process of dying was that it would prolong their distress. Besides being a release from misery, some saw death as a way to reunion with departed loved ones. Others saw death as a way to free their caretakers from the burden of their care.Victor G. Cicirelli, Older Adults' Views on Death (Springer, 2002) 55, 270, 276. Mostly, at all times, old people have been more religious than young people.Grace Davie and John Vincent, “Progress Report: Religion and Old Age,” Ageing and Society, 18, 1998, 110.

McFadden, James W. Ellor, eds.,Aging, Spirituality, and Religion: A Handbook, Vol 1 (Fortress, 1995), 125. The Pew Research Center’s study of black and white old people found that 62% of those in ages 65–74 and 70% in ages 75+ asserted that religion was “very important” to them. For all 65+ people, more women (76%) than men (53%) and more blacks (87%) than whites (63%) consider religion “very important” to them. This compares to 54% in the 30-49 age range.Pew Research Center, “Growing Old in America: Expectations vs. Reality” (2009) 10, 48. Online at http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/Getting-Old-in-America.pdf. In a British 20-year longitudinal study, less than half of the old people surveyed said that religion was “very important” to them and one-fourth said they had become less religious in old age.Laura E. Berk, Development Through the Lifespan, (Allyn & Bacon, 2010). 608. The late-life rise in religiosity is stronger in Japan than in the United States, but in the Netherlands it is minimal. In the practice of religion, a study of 60+ people found that 25% read the Bible every day and over 40% look at religious TV.Melvin A. Kimble, Susan H. McFadden, James W. Ellor, eds.,Aging, Spirituality, and Religion: A Handbook, Vol 1 (Fortress, 1995), 12. Pew Research found that in the age 65+ range, 75% of whites and 87% of blacks pray daily.Pew Research Center, “Growing Old in America: Expectations vs. Reality,” 2009, 45. Online at http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/Getting-Old-in-America.pdf. Participation in organized religion is not a good indicator of religiosity because transportation and health problems often hinder participation. In the industrialized countries, life expectancy and, thus, the old age population have increased consistently over the last decades. In the United States the proportion of people aged 65 or older increased from 4% in 1900 to about 12% in 2000. In 1900, only about  of the nation's citizens were 65 or older (out of 76 million total American citizens). By 2000, the number of senior citizens had increased to about 35 million (of 280 million US citizens). Population experts estimate that more than  Americans—about 17 percent of the population—will be 65 or older in 2020.”Number of old Americans” at http://www.agingstats.gov/Main_Site/Data/2012_Documents/Population.aspx. Accessed December 1, 2013. By 2050, it is projected that at least 400,000 Americans will be 100 or older.Pew Research Center’s Religion & Public Life Project, “Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans’ Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension” (August 6, 2013).

The growing number of people living to their 80s and 90s in the developed world has strained public welfare systems and has also resulted in increased incidence of diseases like cancer and dementia that were rarely seen in premodern times. When the United States Social Security program was created, persons older than 65 numbered only around 5% of the population and the average life expectancy of a 65-year-old in 1936 was approximately 5 years, while in 2011 it could often range from 10–20 years. Other issues that can arise from an increasing population are growing demands for health care and an increase in demand for different types of services.http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v66n1/v66n1p1.html Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes. In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.   According to Erik Erikson’s "Stages of Psychosocial Development”, the human personality is developed in a series of eight stages that take place from the time of birth and continue on throughout an individual’s complete life. He characterises old age as a period of "Integrity vs. Despair", during which a person focuses on reflecting back on his life. Those who are unsuccessful during this phase will feel that their life has been wasted and will experience many regrets. The individual will be left with feelings of bitterness and despair. Those who feel proud of their accomplishments will feel a sense of integrity. Successfully completing this phase means looking back with few regrets and a general feeling of satisfaction. These individuals will attain wisdom, even when confronting death.Erikson, E.H. (1968). Identity: Youth and Crisis. New York: Norton.Erikson, E.H. (1963). Childhood and Society. (2nd ed.). New York: Norton.Carver, C.S. & Scheir, M.F. (2000). Perspectives on Personality. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon Coping is a very important skill needed in the aging process to move forward with life and not be 'stuck' in the past. The way a person adapts and copes, reflects his aging process on a psycho-social level.Yolanda Griffiths and Andrea Thinnes, “Psychological Aspects of Aging” at http://ot.creighton.edu/community/OT_FOR_ELDERS/3rd_Edition_Chapters/Proofs/Padilla_Chapter_04_main.pdf. For people in their 80s and 90s, Joan Erikson added a ninth stage in The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version.Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version (W. W. Norton, 1998). As she wrote, she added the ninth stage because the Integrity of the eighth stage imposes “a serious demand on the senses of elders” and the Wisdom of the eighth stage requires capacities that ninth stage elders “do not usually have.”Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version (W. W. Norton, 1998), 112-113. Newman & Newman also proposed a ninth stage of life, Elderhood. Elderhood refers to those individuals who live past the life expectancy of their birth cohorts. There are two different types of people described in this stage of life.  The "young old" are the healthy individuals who can function on their own without assistance and can complete their daily tasks independently. The "old old" are those who depend on specific services due to declining health or diseases. This period of life is characterized as a period of "immortality vs. extinction." Immortality is the belief that your life will go on past death, some examples are an afterlife or living on through one's family. Extinction refers to feeling as if life has no purpose.Barbara M. Newman, Philip R. Newman, Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach: A Psychosocial Approach (Cengage Learning, 2011), Ch 13 “Later Adulthood (60-75 Years)” and Ch 14, “Elderhood (75 until death).” Social theories, or concepts,“Theory: A conception . . . of something to be done, or of the method of doing it.” Oxford English Dictionary Online . December 2013. propose explanations for the distinctive relationships between old people and their societies. One of the theories is the Disengagement Theory proposed in 1961. This theory proposes that in old age a mutual disengagement between people and their society occurs in anticipation of death. By becoming disengaged from work and family responsibilities, according to this concept, people are enabled to enjoy their old age without stress. This theory has been subjected to the criticism that old age disengagement is neither natural, inevitable, nor beneficial.Michael Totten, “An Overview of Cumming and Henrys Social Disengagement Theory,” http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/an-overview-of-cumming-and-henrys-social-disengagement-theory-3750/. Furthermore, disengaging from social ties in old age is not across the board: unsatisfactory ties are dropped and satisfying ones kept.Laura E. Berk, Development Through the Lifespan, (Allyn & Bacon, 2010), 613. In opposition to the Disengagement Theory the Activity Theory of old age argues that disengagement in old age occurs not by desire, but by the barriers to social engagement imposed by society. This theory has been faulted for not factoring in psychological changes that occur in old age as shown by reduced activity even when available. It has also been found that happiness in old age is not proportional to activity.Laura E. Berk, Development Through the Lifespan, (Allyn & Bacon, 2010), 614. According to the Continuity Theory, in spite of the inevitable differences imposed by their old age, most people try to maintain continuity in personhood, activities, and relationships with their younger days. Socioemotional Selectivity Theory also depicts how people maintain continuity in old age. The focus of this theory is continuity sustained by social networks, albeit networks narrowed by choice and by circumstances. The choice is for more harmonious relationships. The circumstances are loss of relationships by death and distance.Laura E. Berk, Development Through the Lifespan, (Allyn & Bacon, 2010), 614-615. Life expectancy by nation at birth in year 2011 ranged from 48 years to 82.http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/2.21. “Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.” In most parts of the world women live, on average, longer than men; even so, the disparities vary between 12 years in Russia to no difference or higher life expectancy for men in countries such as Zimbabwe and Uganda.de Blij, Harm. The power of place. Geography, Destiny, and Globalization's Rough Landscape. Oxford University Press. London:2009. p161ff The number of elderly persons worldwide began to surge in the second half of the 20th century. Up to that time (and still true in underdeveloped countries), five or less percent of the population was over 65. Few lived longer than their 70s and people who attained advanced age (i.e. their 80s) were rare enough to be a novelty and were revered as wise sages. The worldwide over 65 population in 1960 was one-third of the under 5 population. By 2013, the over 65 population had grown to equal the under 5 population. The over 65 population is projected to double the under five by 2050.National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, NIH Publication no. 11-7737, October 2011, “Global Health and Aging.” Online at http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/global_health.pdf. Before the surge in the over 65 population, accidents and disease claimed many people before they could attain old age, and health problems in those over 65 meant a quick death in most cases. If a person lived to an advanced age, it was due to genetic factors and/or a relatively easy lifestyle, since diseases of old age could not be treated before the 20th century.”Deaths by cause, sex and mortality stratum in WHO regions” online at http://www.who.int/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf. German chancellor Otto von Bismarck created the world's first comprehensive government social safety net in the 1880s, providing for old age pensions. In the United States of America, and the United Kingdom, 65 (UK 60 for women) was traditionally the age of retirement with full old age benefits.For USA, “Old age benefits,” http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Old-Age+Benefits (Accessed December 28, 2013) and for UK, http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-1679780/New-state-pension-age-retire.html (Accessed December 28, 2013). In 2003, the age at which a United States citizen became eligible for full Social Security benefits began to increase gradually, and will continue to do so until it reaches 67 in 2027. Full retirement age for Social Security benefits for people retiring in 2012 is age 66. In the United Kingdom, the state pension age for men and women will rise to 66 in 2020 with further increases scheduled after that.”http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-1679780/New-state-pension-age-retire.html (Accessed December 28, 2013). Originally, the purpose of old age pensions was to prevent elderly persons from being reduced to beggary, which is still common in some underdeveloped countries, but growing life expectancies and older populations have brought into question the model under which pension systems were designed.James H. Schulz and Robert H. Binstock, Aging Nation: The Economics and Politics of Growing Older in America (Johns Hopkins, 2008). 3-4. By 1990, the United States was spending 30 per cent of its budget on the elderly, compared with 2 per cent on education. The dominant perception of the American old age population changed from “needy” and “worthy” to “powerful” and “greedy,” old people getting more than their share of the nation's resources.Laura Katz Olson, The Not-so-golden Years: Caregiving, the Frail Elderly, and the Long-term Care Establishment (Rowman and Littlefield, 2003), 4.

Even with assistive devices as of 2006, 8½ million Americans needed personal assistance because of impaired basic activities of daily living (ADLs) required for personal care or impaired instrumental activities of daily living ( IADLs) required for independent living. Projections place this number at 21 million by 2030 when 40% of Americans over 70 will need assistance.Patricia M. Burbank, editor, Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions (Springer, 2006), 17. There are many options for such long term care to those who require it. There is the home care in which a family member, volunteer, or trained professional will aid the person in need and help with daily activities. Another option is community services which can provide the person with transportation, meal plans, or activities in senior centers. A third option is assisted living where 24 hour round the clock supervision is given with aid in eating, bathing, dressing, etc. A final option is a nursing home which provides professional nursing care.Congressional Budget Office, “Rising Demand for Long-Term Services and Supports for Elderly People” (June 2013) online at http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44363-LTC.pdf.

According to Cox, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon (2012), old age is a risk factor for depression caused by prejudice (i.e., “deprejudice”). When people are prejudiced against the elderly and then become old themselves, their anti-elderly prejudice turns inward, causing depression. “People with more negative age stereotypes will likely have higher rates of depression as they get older.” Old age depression results in the over-65 population having the highest suicide rate.Laura E. Berk, Development Through the Lifespan, (Allyn & Bacon, 2010), 610.
