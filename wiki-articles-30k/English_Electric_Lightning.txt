 The English Electric Lightning is a supersonic fighter aircraft of the Cold War era. It was designed, developed, and manufactured by English Electric, which was subsequently absorbed by the newly formed British Aircraft Corporation. It was then marketed as the BAC Lightning. The Lightning was the only all-British Mach 2 fighter aircraft. The Lightning was used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF). Although it was the RAF's primary interceptor for more than two decades it was never required to attack another aircraft. The Lightning is powered by two Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines in a unique staggered stacked installation in the fuselage. The Lightning was developed to intercept increasingly capable bomber aircraft (Tupolev Tu-16, Tupolev Tu-22, Tupolev Tu-95), and thus has exceptional rate of climb, ceiling, and speed; pilots have described flying it as "being saddled to a skyrocket". This performance made the Lightning a 'fuel critical' aircraft meaning that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range. Later developments provided greater range and speed along with aerial reconnaissance and ground-attack capability. Following retirement in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits and, until 2010, three Lightnings were kept flying at "Thunder City" in Cape Town, South Africa. In September 2008, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers conferred on the Lightning its "Engineering Heritage Award" at a ceremony at BAE Systems' site at Warton Aerodrome.Robinson, Ben. "Historic jet plane gets engineering 'wings' at Lancashire." Lancashire Evening Post, Retrieved: 23 January 2010. The specification for the aircraft followed the cancellation of the Air Ministry's 1942 E.24/43 supersonic research aircraft specification which had resulted in the Miles M.52 programme.Halpenny 1984,  W.E.W. "Teddy" Petter, formerly chief designer at Westland Aircraft, was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft, and proved his point when trials between an RAF Gloster Meteor F.4 and an English Electric Canberra demonstrated that Britain's current air defences would be entirely unable to intercept a bomber travelling at an altitude of  and at a speed of . In 1947, Petter approached the Ministry of Supply with his proposal, in response Specification ER.103 was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at  and .Darling 2000, pp. 6-7. It was apparent that the aircraft's wings would need to be highly swept in order for an aircraft to attain such a high speed, English Electric decided to adopt an angle of 60 degrees. In order to test the design of both the wing and the tailplane and to assess handling, Short Brothers were issued a contract to produce the Short SB5, a low-speed research aircraft. The SB5 was developed so that different wing sweep angles could be assumed by the single aircraft, an assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. The Royal Aircraft Establishment was notably sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts however, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials performed demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60 degree wingsweep proved the design principles to be effective.Darling 2000, pp. 7-8. Aerodynamic data produced from the SB.5 flights and wind tunnel testing helped shape the emerging ER103 design. In 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying airframes, as well as one static airframe, designated P.1.. Following the resignation of Petter, F. W."Freddie" Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.Darling 2000, pp. 8-10. From 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at Salmesbury, these aircraft had been assigned the aircraft serials WG760, WG763, and WG765. In May 1954, WG760 and its support equipment were moved to RAF Boscombe Down for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, WG760, piloted by Roland Beamont, flew for the first time from Boscombe Down.Darling 2000, pp. 10-12. One week later, WG760 officially achieved supersonic flight for the first time, having exceeded the speed of sound during its third flight.Buttler 2000, p. 65. During its first flight, WG760 had unknowingly exceeded , due to position error the Mach meter only showed a maximum of , the occurrence was noticed during flight data analysis a few days later."Progress with the P.1" Flight 26 April 1957 p543 While WG760 had proven the P.1 design to be viable, it was limited to  due to directional stability limits. On 9 June 1952, it had been decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving , these were designated P.1B while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as P.1A.Darling 2000, pp. 16-17. The P.1B featured extensive alterations to the forward fuselage and refinement to the inlet cone that regulated airflow into the engine inlet. In May 1956, the P.1 received the Lightning name, which was said to have been partially selected to reflect the aircraft's supersonic capabilities.Buttler 2000, p. 66. On 25 November 1958, the P.1B became the first British aircraft to fly at Mach 2. The prototypes were powered by un-reheated Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojets as the selected Rolls-Royce Avon engines, which would power subsequent production aircraft, had fallen behind schedule due to their own development issues.Darling 2000, p. 10. Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited endurance, and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings would rapidly wear out.Scott 2000, p. 13. Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment. The first operational Lightning, designated the F.1, was designed as an interceptor to defend the V Force airfields in conjunction with the V Force airfield's own "last ditch" Bristol Bloodhound missile defences from enemy nuclear-armed bomber attack long enough for the also nuclear-armed V Force bombers to take-off and get clear of their airfields, airfields which, along with the dispersal airfields, would be the highest priority targets in the UK for enemy nuclear weapons. To best perform this intercept mission, emphasis was placed on rate-of-climb, acceleration, and speed, rather than range - originally a radius of operation of 150 miles from the V bomber airfields was specified - and combat endurance. It was equipped with two 30&nbsp;mm ADEN cannon in front of the cockpit windscreen and an interchangeable fuselage weapons pack containing either an additional two ADEN cannon, 48  unguided air-to-air rockets, or two de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missiles;Scott 2000, pp. 119–129. a heavy loadout optimized for damaging large aircraft, missile guidance and ranging, as well as search and track functions, mainly were provided via the Ferranti AI.23 onboard radar. The next two Lightning variants, the F.1A and F.2, were steady but relatively minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the F.3, was a major departure. The F.3 had higher thrust Rolls-Royce Avon 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened inlet cone allowing a service clearance to  (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to ).Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965. The A.I.23B radar and Red Top missile offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the F.6, was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3’s shortcomings, the F.3A.  The F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable,  ventral fuel tank,Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, September 1966. and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger leading edge fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel to . The conically cambered wing noticeably improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was very welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106. The F.6 was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally, it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two  ferry tanks on pylons over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from , but the cannon made the F.6 a “real fighter” again. The final British Lightning was the F.2A. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the  ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968. Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over West Germany. The F.53, otherwise known as the Export Lightning, developed as a private venture by BAC; while the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a multirole capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.Flight International 5 September 1968, p. 371. The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for air-to-ground weaponry, including two  bombs or four SNEB rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.Flight International 5 September 1968, pp. 372–373. Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44×  rockets, or a reconnaissance pod fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.Flight International 5 September 1968, p. 373. BAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as drop tanks, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB  rockets and  of fuel) or  bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six  bombs or 44 ×  rockets and 144 × 68&nbsp;mm rockets.Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.Flight International 5 September 1968, pp. 372–373, 376. The T.55 was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6. The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings: exceptional climb rate, agile manoeuvering, and a hard-hitting punch. Unfortunately, the Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.McLelland 2009,  In 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a variable-geometry wing, based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the variable-sweep wing, which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the Royal Navy's existing aircraft carriers carrier-based aircraft, the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.Wood 1986, pp. 183–184. Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer Rolls-Royce Spey engine; it is also likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar. The Lightning had several unique and distinctive design features, the principal of these being the twin engine arrangement, a notched delta wing, and a low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked, longitudinally staggered engines was the solution devised by Petter to the conflicting requirements of minimizing frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the drag equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin engine installations.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with inlet cone), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. However, due to the proximity of the engines, a catastrophic failure of one engine was likely also to damage the other engine. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run in a more efficient power regime for increased range or endurance;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200542.htmlhttp://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201770.html although this was rarely done operationally due to the risk of loss of hydraulic power in the event of engine failure.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200231.html Production aircraft were powered by various models of the Rolls-Royce Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating  of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of . Later models of the Avon would feature, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable reheat arrangement.Darling 2008, pp. 32, 66. In flight, the engines would often reach 600&nbsp;°C in temperature; a special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft's structure. Under optimum conditions, a well-equipped maintenance facility would take four hours to perform an engine change so specialised ground test rigs were developed to speed up maintenance and remove the need to perform a full ground run of the engine after some maintenance tasks.Darling 2008, pp. 32-33. The stacked engine configuration complicated maintenance work, and the leakage of fluid from the upper engine was a recurring fire hazard.Scott 2000, pp. 98–99. The fire risk was reduced, but not eliminated, following remedial work during development.Darling 2008, pp. 25-26. The fuselage was tightly packed, leaving no room for fuel tankage or main landing gear. While the notched delta wing lacked the volume of a standard delta wing, each wing contained a fairly conventional three-section main fuel tank and leading-edge tank, holding ;All fuel tank volumes are listed in Imperial gallons the wing flaps also each contained a  fuel tank and an additional  was contained in a fuel recuperator, bringing the aircraft's total internal fuel capacity to . The main landing gear was sandwiched outboard of the main tanks and aft of the leading edge tanks, with the flap fuel tanks behind.Pilot's Notes, Lightning F Mk.1 and F Mk.1A.

The long main gear legs retracted towards the wingtip, necessitating an exceptionally thin main tyre inflated to the high pressure of .Lightning F Mk.6 Operating Data Manual. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, May 1977. On landing the No. 1 engine was usually shut down when taxying to save brake wear, as keeping both engines running at idle power was still sufficient to propel the Lightning to 80&nbsp;mph if brakes were not used.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1958/1958-1-%20-%200689.html The Lightning featured a conformal ventral store to house either a fuel tank or a rocket engine. The rocket engine, a Napier Double Scorpion motor, also contained a reserve of  of high-test peroxide (HTP) to drive the rocket’s turbopump and act as an oxidizer; fuel would have been drawn from the aircraft internal tankage. The rocket engine was intended at an early stage in the Lightning’s development to boost performance should non-afterburning (reheated) engines be fitted; the subsequent basic performance with reheated Avons was deemed sufficient and the rocket engine option was cancelled in 1958.Scott 2000, pp. 139–142. The ventral store was routinely used as an extra fuel tank, holding  of usable fuel. On later variants of the Lightning, a ventral weapons pack could be installed to equip the aircraft alternatively with different armaments, including missiles, rockets, and cannons.Darling 2008, pp. 45, 78.  Early versions of the Lightning were equipped with the Ferranti-developed AI.23 monopulse radar, which was contained right at the front of the fuselage within an inlet cone at the centre of the engine intake. Radar information was displayed on an early head-up display and managed by onboard computers.Darling 2000, p. 19. The AI.23, an immediate predecessor of the AI.24 Foxhunter, supported several operational modes, which included autonomous search, automatic target tracking, and ranging for all weapons; the pilot attack sight provided gyroscopically-derived lead angle and backup stadiametric ranging for gun firing. The radar and gunsight were collectively designated the AIRPASS: Airborne Interception Radar and Pilot Attack Sight System. The radar would be successively upgraded with the introduction of more capable Lightning variants, such as to provide guidance for the Red Top missile.Darling 2000, pp. 35-38, 54, 78. The cockpit of the Lightning was designed to meet the RAF's OR946 specification for tactical air navigation technology, and thus featured an integrated flight instrument display arrangement, an Elliott Bros (London) Ltdhttp://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200950.html auto-pilot, a master reference gyroscopic reader, an auto-attack system, and an instrument landing system.Darling 2008, p. 25. Despite initial scepticism of the aircraft's centralised detection and warning system, the system proved its merits during the development program and was subsequently redeveloped for greater reliability.Darling 2008, pp. 22-23. Communications included UHF and VHF radios and a datalink.Darling 2000, pp. 26, 27, 38. Unlike the previous generation of aircraft which used gaseous oxygen for lifesupport, the Lightning would employ liquid oxygen-based apparatus for the pilot; cockpit pressurisation and conditioning would be maintained through tappings from the engine compressors.Darling 2008, pp. 27, 35. Electricity was provided via a bleed air-driven turbine housed in the rear fuselage, which in turn drove an AC alternator and DC generator; the approach was considered unusual at the time due to most aircraft using driveshaft-driven generators/alternators for electrical energy. A 28V DC battery provided emergency backup power. Aviation author Kev Darling stated of the Lightning: "Never before had a fighter been so dependent upon electronics".Darling 2000, pp. 20, 25, 35. Each engine was equipped with a pair of hydraulic pumps, one of which would provide pressure for the flight-control systems and the other, pressure for the undercarriage, flaps, and airbrakes; switchable hydraulic circuits were used for redundancy in the event of a leak or other failure. A combination of Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid brakes on the main wheels and an Irvin Air Chutehttp://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200949.html braking parachute slowed the aircraft during landing; a tailhook was also fitted.Darling 2000, pp. 33-34. Accumulators on the wheel brakes performed as backups to the hydraulics, providing minimal braking.Darling 2008, p. 35. A stopped engine could also be 'windmilled' to generate hydraulic power during flight. Towards the end of its service, the Lightning was increasingly outclassed by newer fighters, mainly due to the avionics and armaments being obsolete. The radar had a limited range and no track while scanning capability, and it could detect targets only in a fairly narrow (40 degree) arc. While an automatic collision course attack system was developed and successfully demonstrated by English Electric, it was not adopted due to cost concerns.Jackson Air International June 1986, p. 283.Lake 1997, pp. 51–52, 71–73. Plans were mooted to supplement or replace the obsolete Red Top and Firestreak missiles with modern AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles to help rectify some of the obsolescence, but these ambitions were never realised due to lack of funding.Lake 1997, pp. 86–87. An alternative to the modernization of existing aircraft would have been the development of more advanced variants; a proposed Variable-sweep wing Lightning would have likely involved the adoption of a new powerplant and radar and was believed by BAC to significantly increase performance, but ultimately was not pursued.  "The Lightning ... has probably the fastest rate-of-climb of any combat aircraft" - Flight International, 21 March 1968http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200419.html The Lightning possessed a remarkable climb rate. It was famous for its ability to rapidly rotate from takeoff to climb almost vertically from the runway, though this did not yield the best time-to-altitude. The Lightning's trademark tail-stand manoeuvre exchanged airspeed for altitude; it could slow to near-stall speeds before commencing level flight. The Lightning’s optimum climb profile required the use of afterburners during takeoff. Immediately after takeoff, the nose would be lowered for rapid acceleration to  IAS before initiating a climb, stabilising at . This would yield a constant climb rate of approximately .The Lightning would increase forward velocity during the climb, the angle of the climb lessening from about 27 deg to 19 deg at . Around  the Lightning would reach  and maintain this speed until reaching the tropopause,  on a standard day. If climbing further, pilots would accelerate to supersonic speed at the tropopause before resuming the climb. A Lightning flying at optimum climb profile would reach  in under three minutes.  The official ceiling of the Lightning was kept secret; low security RAF documents would often state in excess of . In September 1962, Fighter Command organised interception trials on Lockheed U-2As at heights of around , which were temporarily based at RAF Upper Heyford to monitor Soviet nuclear tests.Public Record Office, London. TNA AIR 20/11370"Piece details AIR 20/11370."The National Archive of United Kingdom. Retrieved: 23 January 2010.Public Record Office, London. TNA AIR 20/11370 Climb techniques and flight profiles were developed to put the Lightning into a suitable attack position. To avoid risking the U-2, the Lightning was not permitted any closer than  and could not fly in front of the U-2. For the intercepts, four Lightning F1As conducted eighteen solo sorties. The sorties proved that, under GCI, successful intercepts could be made at up to . Due to sensitivity, details of these flights were deliberately avoided in the pilot log books.Black, I. "Chasing the Dragon Lady". Classic Aircraft, Volume 45, Number 8. In 1984, during a NATO exercise, Flt Lt Mike Hale intercepted a U-2 at a height which they had previously considered safe (thought to be ). Records show that Hale also climbed to  in his Lightning F.3 XR749. This was not sustained level flight but a ballistic climb, in which the pilot takes the aircraft to top speed and then puts the aircraft into a climb, exchanging speed for altitude. Hale also participated in time-to-height and acceleration trials against Lockheed F-104 Starfighters from Aalborg. He reports that the Lightnings won all races easily with the exception of the low-level supersonic acceleration, which was a "dead heat".Ross, Charles. "Lightning vs Concorde". The Lightning Association. October 2004. Retrieved: 22 April 2012. Lightning pilot and Chief Examiner Brian Carroll reported taking a Lightning F.53 up to  over Saudi Arabia at which level "Earth curvature was visible and the sky was quite dark", noting that control-wise "[it was] on a knife edge".Carroll, Brian. Lightning.org.uk "Lightning Review". thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk. Retrieved: 12 March 2008. Brian Carroll compared the Lightning and the F-15C Eagle, having flown both aircraft, stating that: "Acceleration in both was impressive, you have all seen the Lightning leap away once brakes are released, the Eagle was almost as good, and climb speed was rapidly achieved. Takeoff roll is between , depending upon military or maximum afterburner-powered takeoff. The Lightning was quicker off the ground, reaching  height in a horizontal distance of ". Chief test pilot for the Lightning Roland Beamont, who also flew most of the "Century Series" US aircraft, stated his opinion that nothing at that time had the inherent stability, control and docile handling characteristics of the Lightning throughout the full flight envelope. The turn performance and buffet boundaries of the Lightning were well in advance of anything known to him.Beamont, Roland. Testing Early Jets . London: Airlife, 1990. ISBN 1-85310-158-3. Early Lightning models, the F.1, F.1A, and F.2, had a rated top speed of  at  in an ICAO standard atmosphere, and  IAS at lower altitudes.Pilot's Notes, Lightning F Mk.2. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, November 1963. Later models, the F.2A, F.3, F.3A, F.6, and F.53, had a rated top speed of  at , and speeds up to  indicated air speed for “operational necessity only”.Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.53. Warton Aerodrome, UK: British Aircraft Corporation Ltd, December 1983. A Lightning fitted with Avon 200-series engines, a ventral tank and two Firestreak missiles typically ran out of excess thrust at  on a Standard Day;Lightning F Mks.1, 1A, 2 & T Mk.4 Aircraft Operating Data Manual. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, November 1975. while a Lightning powered by the Avon 300-series engines, a ventral tank and two Red Top missiles ran out of excess thrust at Mach 2.0. Directional stability decreased as speed increased, there were potentially hazardous consequences in the form of vertical fin failure if yaw was not correctly counteracted by rudder use. Imposed Mach limits during missile launches protected stability; later Lightning variants had a larger vertical fin, giving a greater stability margin at high speed.McLelland 2009, p. 41. Supersonic speeds also threatened inlet stability; the inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip; known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just in front of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock would become supercritical, supersonic airflow entering the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in surges or compressor stalls, these could cause flameouts or damage. Thermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would interfere with the AI 23’s radar emissions. The shock cone would be eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At  and , the heating conditions on the shock cone would be similar to those at Sea Level and  indicated airspeed,On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was  at  and . At sea level and  indicated airspeed, this temperature was . but if the speed was increased to  at , the shock cone would be exposed to higher temperaturesAt Mach 2.0, the stagnation temperature would be . than those at Mach 1.7. The shock cone was strengthened on the later Lightning F.2A, F.3, F.6, and F.53 models, thus allowing routine operations at up to Mach 2.0.McLelland 2009, p. 50. The small-fin variants could exceed Mach 1.7, but the stability limits and shock cone thermal/strength limits made such speeds risky. The large-fin variants, especially those equipped with Avon 300-series engines could safely reach Mach 2, and given the right atmospheric conditions, might even achieve a few more tenths of a Mach. All Lightning variants had the excess thrust to slightly exceed  indicated airspeed under certain conditions,Lightning F Mk.53 & T Mk.55 Aircraft Operating Data Manual. Warton Aerodrome, UK: British Aircraft Corporation Ltd, Preliminary. and the service limit of  was occasionally ignored. With the strengthened shock cone, the Lightning could safely approach its thrust limit, but fuel consumption at very high airspeeds was excessive and became a major limiting factor. The Lightning was fully aerobatic and was capable of rates of roll far in excess of that which could be normally tolerated by a pilot.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200596.html  The first aircraft to enter service with the RAF, three pre-production P.1Bs, arrived at RAF Coltishall in Norfolk on 23 December 1959, joining the Air Fighting Development Squadron (AFDS) of the Central Fighter Establishment, where they were used to clear the Lightning for entry into service.Lake Air International January 2006, p. 64.Lake 1997, p. 43. The production Lightning F.1 entered service with the AFDS in May 1960, allowing the unit to take part in the air defence exercise "Yeoman" later that month. The Lightning F.1 entered frontline squadron service with 74 Squadron under the command of Squadron Leader John "Johnny" Howe at Coltishall from 11 July 1960.Lake 1997, pp. 43–44. Performance achieved was excellent, both the aircraft's radar and missiles had proved to be effective and pilots were reporting that the Lightning was easy to fly. However, in the first few months of operation the aircraft's serviceability was extremely poor. This was due to both the complexity of the Lightning's systems and shortages of spares and ground support equipment. Even when the Lightning was not grounded by technical faults, the RAF initially struggled to get more than 20 flying hours per aircraft per month compared with the 40 flying hours that English Electric believed could be achieved with proper support.Lake 1997, pp. 44–45. In spite of these issues, within six months of the Lightning having entered service, 74 Squadron was able to achieve 100 flying hours per aircraft.Darling 2008, p. 55. In addition to its training and operational roles, 74 Squadron was appointed as the official Fighter Command aerobatic team for 1961, flying at air shows throughout the United Kingdom and Europe.Lake 1997, pp. 45, 95–96. Deliveries of the slightly improved Lightning F.1A, with improved avionics and provision for an air-to-air refuelling probe, allowed two more squadrons, 54 and 111 Squadron, both based at RAF Wattisham to convert to the Lightning in 1960–1961. The Lightning F.1 would only be ordered in limited numbers and serve for a short time, regardless it was viewed as a significant step forwards in Britain's air defence capabilities. Following their replacement from frontline duties by the introduction of successively improved variants of the Lightning, the remaining F.1 aircraft were employed by the Lightning Conversion Squadron.Darling 2008, pp. 56-59.  An improved variant, the F.2 first flew on 11 July 1961Lake 1997, p. 48. and entered service with 19 Squadron at the end of 1962 and 92 Squadron in early 1963. Conversion of these two squadrons was aided by the use of the two seat T.4 trainer, which entered service with the Lightning Conversion Squadron (later renamed 226 Operational Conversion Unit) in June 1962. While the OCU was the major user of the two seater, small numbers were also allocated to the front-line fighter squadrons.Lake Air International January 2006, p. 66. More F.2s were produced than there were available squadron slots, thus later production aircraft were typically stored for years before being used operationally; a number of Lightning F.2s would be undergo conversion to become F.2A aircraft, which featured some of the improvements made upon the more advanced F.6 model.Darling 2008, pp. 66-67. The "next generation" Lightning F.3, with more powerful engines and the ability to use the new Red-Top missile (although at the cost of losing the little-used cannon) was expected to be the definitive Lightning, and at one time it was planned to equip ten squadrons, with the remaining two squadrons retaining the F.2.Lake Air International February 2006, p. 64. On 16 June 1962, the F.3 was first flown.Jackson Air International June 1988, p. 280. The F.3 variant would have a short operational life and be withdrawn from service early due to the combined factors of defence cutbacks and the introduction of the more-capable Lightning F.6 model, of which a small number of F.3s were converted into prior to delivery.Darling 2008, p. 95. The Lightning F.6 was a far-more capable and longer-range version of the F.3; it initially lacked cannon, but in subsequent years installable gun packs were made available.Darling 2008, pp. 95, 105, 121. While a handful of F.3s were upgraded to the F.6 standard, the majority Lightning F.3s were not rebuilt to the F.6 standards, author Kev Darling suggests that decreasing British overseas defence commitments had led to those aircraft instead being prematurely withdrawn. The introduction of the F.6, along with the preceding F.3, allowed the RAF to progressively reequip squadrons operating other interceptor aircraft such as the Gloster Javelin and retire these types during the mid-1960s.Darling 2008, pp. 98, 102. The English Electric Lightning is credited with a single kill in 1972. A British Harrier pilot had ejected from his aircraft following apparent engine failure; however, the pilotless aircraft unintentionally maintained flight and was heading towards the East German border. To avoid a diplomatic incident the Harrier was shot down.Darling 2008, p. 88. During British Airways trials in April 1985, Concorde was offered as a target to NATO fighters including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, F-14 Tomcats, Mirages, and F-104 Starfighters - but only Lightning XR749, flown by Mike Hale and described by him as "a very hot ship, even for a Lightning", managed to overtake Concorde on a stern conversion intercept. During the 1960s, as strategic awareness increased and a multitude of alternative fighter designs were developed by Warsaw Pact and NATO members, the Lightning's range and firepower shortcomings became increasingly apparent. The transfer of McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs from Royal Navy service enabled these much longer-ranged aircraft to be added to the RAF's interceptor force alongside those withdrawn from Germany as they were replaced by SEPECAT Jaguars in the ground attack role. The Lightning's direct replacement was the Tornado F3s, an interceptor variant of the Panavia Tornado. The Tornado featured several advantages over the Lightning, including a far larger weapons load and considerably more advanced avionics.Laming 1996, p. 97. Lightnings were slowly phased out of service between 1974 and 1988. In their final years the airframes required considerable maintenance to keep them airworthy due to the sheer number of accumulated flight hours.  On 21 December 1965, Saudi Arabia, keen to improve its air defences owing to the Saudi involvement in the North Yemen Civil War and the resultant air incursions into Saudi airspace by Egyptian forces supporting the Yemeni Republicans, placed a series of orders with Britain and the United States to build a new integrated air defence system. BAC received orders for 34 multirole single-seat Lightning F.53s that could still retain very high performance and reasonable endurance, and six two-seat T.55 trainers, together with 25 BAC Strikemaster trainers, while the contract also included new radar systems, American HAWK surface-to-air missiles and training and support services. In order to provide an urgent counter to the air incursions, with Saudi towns close to the border being bombed by Egyptian aircraft, an additional interim contract, called "Magic Carpet", was placed in March 1966 for the supply of six ex-RAF Lightnings (four F.2s and two T.4 trainers, redesignated F.52 and T.54 respectively), six Hawker Hunters, two air defence radars and a number of Thunderbird surface-to-air missiles.Lake 1997, pp. 56–57."Punter" Air International October 1978, pp. 167–168. The "Magic Carpet" Lightnings were delivered to Saudi Arabia in July 1966, with an additional F.52 being delivered in May 1967 to replace a Lightning lost in an accident. The Lightnings and Hunters, flown by mercenary pilots, were deployed to Khamis Mushait airfield near the Yemeni border, resulting in the curtailing of operations by the Egyptian Air Force over the Yemeni-Saudi border.Lake 1997, p. 57. Although the first F.53s had been handed over to the RSAF in December 1967, they were kept at Warton while trials and development continued and the first Saudi Lightnings to leave Warton were four T.55s delivered in early 1968 to the Royal Air Force 226 Operational Conversion Unit at RAF Coltishall, the four T.55s were used to train Saudi aircrew for the next 18 months.Ransom and Fairclough 1987, p. 258. The new-build Lightnings were delivered under Operation "Magic Palm" between July 1968 and August 1969. Two Lightnings, a F.53 and a T.55 were destroyed in accidents prior to delivery, and were replaced by two additional aircraft, the last of which was delivered in June 1972.Jackson Air International June 1988, p. 282.  The multirole F.53s served in the ground-attack and reconnaissance roles as well as an air defence fighter, with Lightnings of No 6 Squadron RSAF carrying out ground-attack missions using rockets and bombs during a border dispute with South Yemen between December 1969 and May 1970. One F.53 (53-697) was shot down by Yemeni ground fire on 3 May 1970 during a reconnaissance mission, with the pilot ejecting successfully and being rescued by Saudi forces.Lake 1997, pp. 58, 100. Saudi Arabia received Northrop F-5E fighters from 1971, which resulted in the Lightnings relinquishing the ground-attack mission, concentrating on air defence, and to a lesser extent, reconnaissance.Lake 1997, p. 58. Up to 1982, the Lightnings were mainly operated by 2 and 6 Squadron RSAF (although a few were also used by 13 Squadron RSAF), but when 6 Squadron re-equipped with the F-15 Eagle then all the remaining aircraft were operated by 2 Squadron at Tabuk.Ransom and Fairclough 1987, p. 267.Lake 1997, pp. 100–101. In 1985 as part of the agreement to sell the Panavia Tornado to the RSAF, the 22 flyable Lightnings were traded in to British Aerospace and returned to Warton in January 1986. While BAe offered the ex-Saudi Lightnings to Austria and Nigeria, no sales were made, and the aircraft were eventually disposed of to museums.Lake 1997, p. 82. Kuwait also ordered 14 Lightnings in December 1966, comprising 12 F.53Ks and two T.55Ks. The first Kuwait aircraft, a T.55K first flew on 24 May 1968 and deliveries to Kuwait started in December 1968.Ransom and Fairclough 1987, p. 259. The Kuwaitis somewhat overestimated their ability to maintain such a complex aircraft, not adopting the extensive support from BAC and Airwork Services that the Saudis used to keep their Lightnings operational, so serviceability was poor.Lake 1997, p. 59. The Kuwaiti Lightnings did not have a long service career; after unsuccessfully trying to sell them to Egypt in 1973, Kuwait replaced its last Lightnings with Dassault Mirage F1s in 1977.Lake 1997, p. 62. The remaining aircraft were stored at Kuwait International Airport, many were subsequently destroyed during the Invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990.Darling 2000, p. 96.

The following are on display but with no public access:         The main Lightning role was the air defence of the United Kingdom and was operated at first as part of Fighter Command and then from 1968 with No. 11 Group of Strike Command. At the formation of Strike Command nine Lightning squadrons were operational in the United Kingdom.Orbis 1985, pp. 146-153 In 1967 No. 74 Squadron was moved to RAF Tengah, Singapore to take over the air defence role from the Gloster Javelin equipped 60 Squadron."Lightning shuffle."
