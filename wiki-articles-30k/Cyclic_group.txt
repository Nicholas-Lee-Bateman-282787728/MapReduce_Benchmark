  In algebra, a cyclic group or monogenous group is a group that is generated by a single element. That is, it consists of a set of elements with a single invertible associative operation, and it contains an element&nbsp;g such that every other element of the group may be obtained by repeatedly applying the group operation or its inverse to&nbsp;g. Each element can be written as a power of g in multiplicative notation, or as a multiple of g in additive notation.  This element g is called a generator of the group. Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group of Z, the integers. Every finite cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the additive group of Z/nZ, the integers modulo n. Every cyclic group is an abelian group (meaning that its group operation is commutative), and every finitely generated abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups. A group G is called cyclic if there exists an element g in G such that  Since any group generated by an element in a group is a subgroup of that group, showing that the only subgroup of a group G that contains g is G itself suffices to show that G is cyclic. For example, if G = { g0, g1, g2, g3, g4, g5 } is a group of order 6, then g6 = g0, and G is cyclic.  In fact, G is essentially the same as (that is, isomorphic to) the set {{nowrap|{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }}} with addition [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 6. For example, {{nowrap|1 + 2 ≡ 3 (mod 6)}} corresponds to {{nowrap|1=''g''<sup>1</sup> · ''g''<sup>2</sup> = ''g''<sup>3</sup>}}, and {{nowrap|2 + 5 ≡ 1 (mod 6)}} corresponds to {{nowrap|1=''g''<sup>2</sup> · ''g''<sup>5</sup> = ''g''<sup>7</sup> = ''g''<sup>1</sup>}}, and so on. One can use the isomorphism χ defined by {{nowrap|1=χ(''g''<sup>''i''</sup>) = ''i''}}.  The name "cyclic" may be misleading:<ref>{{Harv|Lajoie|Mura|2000|pp=29–33}}.</ref> it is possible to generate infinitely many elements and not form any literal cycles; that is, every ''g''<sup>''n''</sup> is distinct. (It can be thought of as having one infinitely long cycle.) A group generated in this way (for example, the first [[Frieze group#Descriptions of the seven frieze groups|frieze group]], p1) is called an '''infinite cyclic group''', and is isomorphic to the additive group of the [[integer]]s, {{nowrap|('''Z''', +)}}.  [[Nicolas Bourbaki]], who was the French mathematicians group, called a cyclic group as '''monogenous group''',{{refn|group=note|name="algebra1.§4.10"|{{Quotation|DEFINITION 15.

In this group, 1 and −1 are the only generators. Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to this group.  For every positive integer ''n'', the set of integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]&nbsp;''n'', again with the operation of addition, forms a finite cyclic group, the group '''Z'''/''n''.<ref name="eom"/> An element ''g'' is a generator of this group if ''g'' is [[relatively prime]] to ''n''. Thus, the number of different generators is φ(''n''), where φ is the [[Euler totient function]], the function that counts the number of numbers modulo&nbsp;''n'' that are relatively prime to ''n''. Every finite cyclic group is isomorphic to a group '''Z'''/''n'', where ''n'' is the order of the group.  The integer and modular addition operations, used to define the cyclic groups, are both the addition operations of [[commutative ring]]s, also denoted '''Z''' and '''Z'''/''n''. If ''p'' is a prime, then '''Z'''/''p'' is a [[finite field]], and is usually instead written as '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub> or GF(''p''). Every field with ''p'' elements is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to this one.  ===Modular multiplication=== {{main|Multiplicative group of integers modulo n}} For every positive integer ''n'', the subset of the integers modulo&nbsp;''n'' that are relatively prime to&nbsp;''n'', with the operation of multiplication, forms a finite group that for many values of ''n'' is again cyclic. It is the [[Multiplicative group of integers modulo n|group under multiplication modulo ''n'']], and it is cyclic whenever ''n'' is 1, 2, 4, a [[prime power|power of an odd prime]], or twice a power of an odd prime.<ref>{{Harv|Vinogradov|2003|loc=&sect; VI PRIMITIVE ROOTS AND INDICES|pp=105–132}}.</ref> {{OEIS|A033948}} <ref>{{Harv|Motwani|Raghavan|1995|p=401}}.</ref> Its elements are the [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] of the ring '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''; there are φ(''n'') of them, where again φ is the totient function. This group is written as ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')<sup>×</sup>. For example,  ('''Z'''/6'''Z''')<sup>×</sup> has as its elements {1,5}; 6 is twice a prime, so this is a cyclic group. In contrast,  ('''Z'''/8'''Z''')<sup>×</sup> (with elements {1,3,5,7}) is the [[Klein group]] and is not cyclic. When ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')<sup>×</sup> is cyclic, every generator of ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')<sup>×</sup> is called a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root modulo ''n'']].  The cyclic group ('''Z'''/''p'''''Z''')<sup>×</sup> for a prime number ''p'', is also written ('''Z'''/''p'''''Z''')<sup>*</sup> because it consists of the non-zero elements of the [[finite field]] of order ''p''. More generally, every finite [[subgroup]] of the multiplicative group of any [[field (mathematics)|field]] is cyclic.<ref>{{Harv|Rotman|1998|p=65}}.</ref>  ===Rotational symmetries=== {{main|Rotational symmetry}} The set of [[rotational symmetry|rotational symmetries]] of a [[polygon]] forms a finite cyclic group.<ref>{{Harv|Stewart|Golubitsky|2010||pp=47–48}}.</ref> If there are ''n'' different ways of mapping the polygon to itself by a rotation (including the null rotation) then this group is isomorphic to Z<sub>n</sub>. In three or higher dimensions there can exist other [[Point groups in three dimensions#Cyclic 3D symmetry groups|finite symmetry groups that are cyclic]], but that do not form the set of rotations around a single axis.  The group ''S''<sup>1</sup> of all rotations of a [[circle]] (the [[circle group]]) is ''not'' cyclic. Unlike the infinite cyclic group, it is not even [[countable]]. There also exist other infinite rotation groups (such as the set of rotations by rational angles) that are countable but not cyclic.  ===Galois theory=== An ''n''th [[root of unity]] may be thought of as a [[complex number]] whose ''n''th power is&nbsp;1. That is, it is a [[root of a polynomial|root]] of the polynomial ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1. The ''n''th roots of unity form a cyclic group of order ''n'' under multiplication.<ref name="eom"/> For example, the polynomial {{nowrap|1=0 = ''z''<sup>3</sup> − 1}} factors as {{nowrap|1=(''z'' − ''s''<sup>0</sup>)(''z'' − ''s''<sup>1</sup>)(''z'' − ''s''<sup>2</sup>)}}, where {{nowrap|1=''s'' = ''e''<sup>2π''i''/3</sup>}}; the set {''s''<sup>0</sup>, ''s''<sup>1</sup>, ''s''<sup>2</sup>} forms a cyclic group under multiplication. The [[Galois group]] of the [[field extension]] of the [[rational number]]s generated by the ''n''th roots of unity forms a different group. It is isomorphic to the multiplicative group modulo&nbsp;''n'', which has order φ(''n'') and is cyclic for some but not all&nbsp;''n''.  A field extension is called a [[cyclic extension]] if its Galois group is a cyclic group. The Galois group of every finite extension of a [[finite field]] is finite and cyclic, with an iterate of the [[Frobenius endomorphism]] as its generator.<ref>{{Harv|Cox|2012|loc = Theorem&nbsp;11.1.7|p=294}}.</ref> Conversely, given a finite field ''F'' and a finite cyclic group ''G'', there is a finite field extension of ''F'' whose Galois group is ''G''.<ref>{{Harv|Cox|2012|loc=Corollary 11.1.8 and Theorem 11.1.9|p=295}}.</ref>  ==Subgroups and notation== {{main|Fundamental theorem of cyclic groups}} All [[subgroup]]s and [[quotient group]]s of cyclic groups are cyclic. Specifically, all subgroups of '''Z''' are of the form ''m'''''Z''', with ''m'' an integer ≥0. All of these subgroups are distinct from each other, and apart from the trivial group (for {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 0}}) all are [[isomorphic]] to '''Z'''. The [[lattice of subgroups]] of '''Z''' is isomorphic to the [[Duality (order theory)|dual]] of the lattice of natural numbers ordered by [[divisibility]].<ref>{{Harv|Aluffi|2009|pp=82–84|loc=6.4 Example: Subgroups of Cyclic Groups}}.</ref> In particular, because the prime numbers are the numbers with no nontrivial divisors,  a cyclic group is [[simple group|simple]] if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is prime.<ref>{{Harv|Gannon|2006|p=18|}}.</ref>  Since the cyclic groups are [[Abelian group|abelian]], they are often written additively and denoted Z<sub>''n''</sub> with the identity written 0.  However, this notation can be problematic for [[number theory|number theorists]] because it conflicts with the usual notation for [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]] rings or [[localization of a ring|localization]] at a [[prime ideal]]. The [[quotient group|quotient]] notations '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''', '''Z'''/''n'', and '''Z'''/(''n'') are standard alternatives.  One may instead write the group  multiplicatively, and denote it by C<sub>''n''</sub>, where ''n'' is the order for finite groups and by C for the infinite cyclic group.{{refn|group=note|The infinite cyclic group written multiplicatively may be written C (most common), C<sub>∞</sub> (the subscript being interpreted as the order of the group), or even C<sub>0</sub> (to fit the statement {{nowrap|C<sub>''n''</sub> ≅ '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''', ''n'' ≥ 0}}, as given [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cyclic%20group cyclic group in nLab]).}} For example, {{nowrap|1=''g''<sup>2</sup>''g''<sup>4</sup> = ''g''<sup>1</sup>}} in C<sub>5</sub>, whereas {{nowrap|1=2 + 4 = 1}} in '''Z'''/5'''Z'''.  All quotient groups of '''Z''' are finite, except for the trivial exception {{nowrap|1='''Z'''/{0} = '''Z'''/0'''Z'''}}. For every positive divisor ''d'' of ''n'', the quotient group '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' has precisely one subgroup of order ''d'', the one generated by the residue class of ''n''/''d''. There are no other subgroups. Using the quotient group formalism, '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is a standard notation for the additive cyclic group with ''n'' elements.  In [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] terminology, the subgroup ''n'''''Z''' is also the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] (''n''), so the quotient can also be written '''Z'''/(''n'') or '''Z'''/''n'' without abuse of notation.  These alternatives do not conflict with the notation for the ''p''-adic integers.  The last form is very common in informal calculations; it has the additional advantage that it reads the same way that the group or ring is often described verbally in English, "Zee mod en".  ==Additional properties== Every cyclic group is [[abelian group|abelian]].<ref name="eom"/> That is, its group operation is [[Commutative property|commutative]]: {{nowrap|1=''gh'' = ''hg''}} (for all ''g'' and ''h'' in ''G''). This is clear for the groups of integer and modular addition since {{nowrap|''r'' + ''s'' ≡ ''s'' + ''r'' (mod ''n'')}}, and it follows for all cyclic groups since they are all isomorphic to a group generated by an addition operation. For a finite cyclic group of order ''n'', and every element ''e'' of the group, ''e''<sup>''n''</sup> is the identity element of the group. This again follows by using the isomorphism to modular addition, since {{nowrap|''kn'' ≡ 0 (mod ''n'')}} for every integer ''k''.  If ''d'' is a [[divisor]] of ''n'', then the number of elements in '''Z'''/''n'' which have order ''d'' is φ(''d''), and the number of elements whose order divides ''d'' is exactly ''d''. If ''G'' is a finite group in which, for each {{nowrap|''n'' > 0}}, ''G'' contains at most ''n'' elements of order dividing ''n'', then ''G'' must be cyclic.{{refn|group=note|This implication remains true even if only prime values of ''n'' are considered. See {{Harvtxt|Gallian|2010|loc = Exercise&nbsp;43|p=84}}. (And observe that when ''n'' is prime, there is exactly one element whose order is a proper divisor of ''n'', namely the identity.)}} The order of an element ''m'' of the group is ''n''/[[greatest common divisor|gcd]](''n'',''m'').  The [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of two cyclic groups '''Z'''/''n'' and '''Z'''/''m'' is cyclic if and only if ''n'' and ''m'' are [[coprime]]. Thus e.g. '''Z'''/12 is the direct product of '''Z'''/3 and '''Z'''/4, but not the direct product of '''Z'''/6 and '''Z'''/2. If ''p'' is a [[prime number]], then the only group ([[up to]] [[group isomorphism|isomorphism]]) with ''p'' elements is '''Z'''/''p''. it is called a [[primary cyclic group]]. The [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups|fundamental theorem of abelian groups]] states that every [[finitely generated abelian group]] is the direct product of finitely many finite primary cyclic and infinite cyclic groups. A number ''n''  is called a [[cyclic number (group theory)|cyclic number]] if it has the property that '''Z'''/''n'' is the only group of order ''n'', which is true exactly when gcd(''n'',φ(''n''))&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.<ref>{{Harv|Jungnickel|1992|pp=545–547}}.</ref> The cyclic numbers include all prime numbers, but also include some [[composite number]]s such as&nbsp;15. However, except 2, all cyclic numbers are odd. The cyclic numbers are: :1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 41, 43, 47, 51, 53, 59, 61, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 95, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 115, 119, 123, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 141, 143, ... {{OEIS|id=A003277}}  In fact, a number ''n'' is a cyclic number [[if and only if]] [[greatest common divisor|gcd]](''n'', φ(''n'')) = 1, where φ is the [[Euler's totient function]].  The definition immediately implies that cyclic groups have [[presentation of a group|group presentation]] {{nowrap|1=C<sub>∞</sub> = ⟨''x'' {{!}}⟩}} and {{nowrap|1=C<sub>''n''</sub> = ⟨''x'' {{!}} ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>⟩}} for finite ''n''.<ref>{{Harv|Coxeter|Moser|1980|p=1}}.</ref>  ==Associated objects==  ===Representations=== The [[Representation theory of finite groups|representation theory]] of the cyclic group is a critical base case for the representation theory of more general finite groups.  In the [[character theory|complex case]], a representation of a cyclic group decomposes into a direct sum of linear characters, making the connection between character theory and representation theory transparent.  In the [[modular representation theory|positive characteristic case]], the indecomposable representations of the cyclic group form a model and inductive basis for the representation theory of groups with cyclic [[Sylow subgroup]]s and more generally the representation theory of blocks of cyclic defect.  ===Cycle graph=== {{Further|Cycle graph (algebra)}} A '''cycle graph''' illustrates the various cycles of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and is particularly useful in visualizing the structure of small [[finite group]]s. A cycle graph for a cyclic group is simply a [[circular graph]], where the group order is equal to the number of nodes. A single generator defines the group as a directional path on the graph, and the inverse generator defines a backwards path. Trivial paths (identity) can be drawn as a [[Loop (graph theory)|loop]] but are usually suppressed. Z<sub>2</sub> is sometimes drawn with two curved edges as a [[multigraph]].<ref>{{MathWorld|title=Cycle Graph|id=CycleGraph}}</ref>  Cyclic groups Z<sub>''n''</sub>, order ''n'', is a single cycle graphed simply as an ''n''-sided polygon with the elements at the vertices. A cyclic group Z<sub>''n''</sub> can be decomposed into a [[direct product]] Z<sub>''a''</sub>×Z<sub>''b''</sub> where ''n''=''ab'', where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[relatively prime]] ([[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](a,b)=1). {| class="wikitable" |+ Cycle graphs up to order 24 |- align=center | [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC1.svg|40px]] | [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC2.svg|60px]] | [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC3.svg|60px]] | [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC4.svg|60px]] | [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC5.svg|60px]] | [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC6.svg|60px]] | [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC7.svg|60px]] | [[File:GroupDiagramMiniC8.svg|60px]] |- !

In the case of a finite cyclic group, with its single generator, the Cayley graph is a [[cycle graph]], and for an infinite cyclic group with its generator the Cayley graph is a doubly infinite [[path graph]]. However, Cayley graphs can be defined from other sets of generators as well. The Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with arbitrary generator sets are called [[circulant graph]]s.<ref>{{Harv|Alspach|1997|pp=1–22}}.</ref> These graphs may be represented geometrically as a set of equally spaced points on a circle or on a line, with each point connected to neighbors with the same set of distances as each other point.

This is a bijection if and only if ''r'' is coprime with ''n'', so the [[automorphism group]] of '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is isomorphic to the unit group ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')<sup>×</sup>.<ref name="ks"/>  Similarly, the endomorphism ring of the additive group of '''Z''' is isomorphic to the ring '''Z'''.  Its automorphism group is isomorphic to the group of units of the ring '''Z''', i.e. to {{nowrap|({−1, +1}, ×) ≅ C<sub>2</sub>}}.  ===Tensor product and Hom of cyclic groups=== The [[tensor product]] <math>\mathbb{Z}/m{\mathbb{Z}} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/n{\mathbb{Z}}</math> and the group of homomorphisms <math>Hom (\mathbb{Z}/m{\mathbb{Z}}, \mathbb{Z}/n{\mathbb{Z}})</math> can be shown to both be isomorphic to <math>\mathbb{Z}/gcd (m, n){\mathbb{Z}}</math>.  For the tensor product, this is a consequence of the general fact <math>R/I \otimes_R R/J \cong R/(I+J)</math>. For the Hom group, recall that it is isomorphic to the subgroup of <math>\mathbb{Z}/n{\mathbb{Z}}</math> consisting of the elements of order dividing ''m''. That subgroup is cyclic of order gcd (m, n), which completes the proof.  ==Related classes of groups== Several other classes of groups have been defined by their relation to the cyclic groups:  ===Virtually cyclic groups=== A group is called '''virtually cyclic''' if it contains a cyclic subgroup of finite [[index (group theory)|index]] (the number of [[coset]]s that the subgroup has). In other words, any element in a virtually cyclic group can be arrived at by applying a member of the cyclic subgroup to a member in a certain finite set. Every cyclic group is virtually cyclic, as is every finite group. An infinite group is virtually cyclic if and only if it is [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] and has exactly two [[End (graph theory)|ends]];<ref group=note>See {{Harvtxt|Stallings|1970|pp=124–128}}. See in particular [http://books.google.com/books?id=3Lyvsc694T4C&pg=PA126 p.&nbsp;126]: "If ''G'' has two ends, the explicit structure of ''G'' is well known: ''G'' is an extension of a finite group by either the infinite cyclic group or the infinite dihedral group."</ref> an example of such a group is the [[direct product of groups|product]] of '''Z'''/''n'' and '''Z''', in which the '''Z''' factor has finite index&nbsp;''n''.

An example is the additive group of the [[rational number]]s: every finite set of rational numbers is a set of integer multiples of a single [[unit fraction]], the inverse of their [[lowest common denominator]], and generates as a subgroup a cyclic group of integer multiples of this unit fraction.

The [[polycyclic group]]s generalize metacyclic groups by allowing more than one level of group extension. A group is polycyclic if it has a finite descending sequence of subgroups, each of which is normal in the previous subgroup with a cyclic quotient, ending in the trivial group.
