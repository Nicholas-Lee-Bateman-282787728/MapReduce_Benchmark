 In law, a judgment is a decision of a court regarding the rights and liabilities of parties in a legal action or proceeding.Black’s Law Dictionary 970 (10th ed. 2014). Judgments also generally provide the court's explanation of why it has chosen to make a particular court order.Black’s Law Dictionary 970 (10th ed. 2014). The phrase "reasons for judgment" is often used interchangeably with "judgment," although the former refers to the court's justification of its judgment while the latter refers to the final court order regarding the rights and liabilities of the parties.The Courts of British Columbia: Supreme Court, About Judgments (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/supreme_court/about_judgments.aspx. As the main legal systems of the world recognize either a common law, statutory, or constitutional duty to provide reasons for a judgment, drawing a distinction between "judgment" and "reasons for judgment" may be unnecessary in most circumstances. Judgment is considered a "free variation" word, and the use of either judgment or judgement (with an e) is considered acceptable.Sylvia Chalker & Edmund Weiner, Oxford Dictionary of English Grammar 160 (Oxford U.P. 1994). This variation arises depending on the country and the use of judgment in a legal or non-legal context. British, American, and Canadian English generally use judgment when referring to a court's formal ruling.New Oxford American English Dictionary, Judgment (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/judgment (See specifically, "Usage"). Judgement is commonly used in the United Kingdom when referring to a non-legal decision.New Oxford American English Dictionary, Judgment (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/judgment (See specifically, "Usage"). Judgment is also used in Australian and New Zealand English when referring to a court's formal ruling.New Zealand Oxford Dictionary, Judgment (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195584516.001.0001/acref-9780195584516.Australian Oxford Dictionary, Judgment (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195517965.001.0001/acref-9780195517965?hide=true&page=2893&pageSize=10&sort=titlesort&source=%2F10.1093%2Facref%2F9780195517965.001.0001%2Facref-9780195517965. Non-English translations of judgment demonstrate varied spelling. For instance, the English translation of France's Code of Civil Procedure uses judgement throughout.Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), translated at http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation). Decisions of a quasi-judicial body and administrative bodies may be colloquially referred to as "judgments." However, these decisions can be distinguished from judgments as the legal definition of judgment contemplates decisions made by judges in a court of law.Black’s Law Dictionary 970 (10th ed. 2014). Therefore, even if a quasi-judicial or administrative body considers questions of law, its decisions might not be referred to as judgments. A judgment may be provided either in written or oral form depending on the circumstances.Roman N Komar, Reasons for Judgment: A Handbook for Judges and Other Judicial Officers 8 (Butterworth & Co. Ltd. 1980). Oral judgments are often provided at the conclusion of a hearing and are frequently used by courts with heavier caseloadsRoman N Komar, Reasons for Judgment: A Handbook for Judges and Other Judicial Officers 14 (Butterworth & Co. Ltd. 1980). or where a judgment must be rendered quickly.Roman N Komar, Reasons for Judgment: A Handbook for Judges and Other Judicial Officers 15 (Butterworth & Co. Ltd. 1980). Written reasons for judgment are often provided in circumstances where a complex decision must be made, where the matter is likely to be appealed, or where the decision is considered to be of some significant importance to members of the legal community and/or the public at large.Roman N Komar, Reasons for Judgment: A Handbook for Judges and Other Judicial Officers 9-10 (Butterworth & Co. Ltd. 1980). Written reasons for judgment are not generally provided immediately following the hearing and may take days, weeks, or even months to be released.The Courts of British Columbia: Supreme Court, About Judgments (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/supreme_court/about_judgments.aspx. Types of judgments can be distinguished on a number of grounds, including the procedures the parties must follow to obtain the judgment, the issues the court will consider before rendering the judgment, and the effect of the judgment. Judgments that vary from a standard judgment on the merits of a case include the following: If more than one judge is deciding a case, the judgment may be delivered unanimously or it may be divided into a number of majority, concurring, plurality, and dissenting opinions. Only the opinion of the majority judgment is considered to have precedent-setting weight. Some examples of opinions within judgments include: When a court renders a judgment, it may state that the successful party has a right to recover money or property. However, the court will not collect the money or property on behalf of the successful party without further action. In common law legal systems, judgment enforcement is regulated by administrative divisions such as a province, territory, or federated state, while in civil law legal systems judgment enforcement is regulated through the national Code of Civil Procedure. Judgment enforcement, on a conceptual level, is conducted in a similar way across different legal systems. Specific references to the judgment enforcement rules of Germany, Canada (Saskatchewan), and the United States (California) are made in this section. The successful party may receive immediate payment from the unsuccessful party on the basis of the judgment and not require further action. A successful party who does not receive immediate payment must initiate a judgment enforcement process in order to collect the money or property that they are entitled to under the judgment.Courts of Saskatchewan, Enforcing Orders (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.sasklawcourts.ca/index.php/home/court-of-queen-s-bench/enforcement-of-orders (See specifically "Enforcing Orders").The Superior Court of California, County of Orange, Collecting the Judgment – Plaintiff (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.occourts.org/self-help/smallclaims/collectingthejudgment.html (See specifically "Enforcing Your Judgment").European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, Enforcement of judgements – Germany (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/enforce_judgement/enforce_judgement_ger_en.htm (See specifically "What are the conditions under which an enforceable title or decision may be issued?"). Once this process is initiated, the successful party may be referred to as the judgment creditor while the unsuccessful party will be referred to as the judgment debtor in North America.Courts of Saskatchewan, Enforcing Orders (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.sasklawcourts.ca/index.php/home/court-of-queen-s-bench/enforcement-of-orders (See specifically "Enforcing Orders").The Superior Court of California, County of Orange, Collecting the Judgment – Plaintiff (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.occourts.org/self-help/smallclaims/collectingthejudgment.html (See specifically "Introduction"). Judgment creditors can register their judgments through the property registry system in their jurisdictions,Courts of Saskatchewan, Enforcing Orders (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.sasklawcourts.ca/index.php/home/court-of-queen-s-bench/enforcement-of-orders (See specifically "Step 3 - Register Your Judgment with the Land Titles Registry"). levy the property in question through a writ of execution,The Superior Court of California, County of Orange, Collecting the Judgment – Plaintiff (Last accessed March 28, 2015),http://www.occourts.org/self-help/smallclaims/collectingthejudgment.html (See specifically "Levying (Seize) Assets Using a Writ of Execution"). or seek a court order for enforcementEuropean Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, Enforcement of judgements – Germany (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/enforce_judgement/enforce_judgement_ger_en.htm (See specifically "What are the conditions under which an enforceable title or decision may be issued?"). depending on the options available in their jurisdiction. Judgment creditors may also need to investigate whether judgment debtors are capable of paying.Courts of Saskatchewan, Enforcing Orders (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.sasklawcourts.ca/index.php/home/court-of-queen-s-bench/enforcement-of-orders (See specifically "Step 5 (Optional) - Question the Judgment Debtor"). Understanding whether a judgment debtor is capable of fulfilling the judgment order may affect the enforcement mechanism used to recover the money or property. Some steps are available in different jurisdictions to investigate or interview judgment creditors, and investigations may be conducted either by the judgment creditor or by a sheriff or bailiff.Courts of Saskatchewan, Enforcing Orders (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.sasklawcourts.ca/index.php/home/court-of-queen-s-bench/enforcement-of-orders (See specifically "Step 4 (Optional) - Give The Sheriff an Enforcement Instruction").European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, Enforcement of judgements – Germany (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/enforce_judgement/enforce_judgement_ger_en.htm (See specifically "Enforcement agents' status, role, responsibilities and powers"). Different enforcement mechanisms exist, including seizure and sale of the judgment debtor's property or garnishment.Courts of Saskatchewan, Enforcing Orders (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.sasklawcourts.ca/index.php/home/court-of-queen-s-bench/enforcement-of-orders (See specifically "Step 7 - Distribution of Monies Collected by Sheriff"). Some jurisdictions, like California, also allow for additional enforcement mechanisms depending on the circumstances, such as suspending the judgment debtor's driver's license or professional license.The Superior Court of California, County of Orange, Collecting the Judgment – Plaintiff (Last accessed March 28, 2015),http://www.occourts.org/self-help/smallclaims/collectingthejudgment.html (See specifically "Suspending A Driver's License" and "Suspending A Professional License). In Germany, a bailiff is responsible for enforcing the judgment and is empowered to use a number of different enforcement mechanisms.European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, Enforcement of judgements – Germany (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/enforce_judgement/enforce_judgement_ger_en.htm (See specifically "Enforcement agents' status, role, responsibilities and powers").

In California and Saskatchewan, the judgment creditor is entitled to enforce the judgment 10 years past the judgment date subject to exceptions that allow the judgment creditor to renew the enforcement for an additional 10 years.The Superior Court of California, County of Orange, Collecting the Judgment – Plaintiff (Last accessed March 28, 2015),http://www.occourts.org/self-help/smallclaims/collectingthejudgment.html (See specifically "How Long a Judgment Is Valid"). Courts of Saskatchewan, Enforcing Orders (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.sasklawcourts.ca/index.php/home/court-of-queen-s-bench/enforcement-of-orders (See specifically "Enforcing Orders"). Release of Judgments Depending on the jurisdiction, the judgment debtor may be able to obtain a "satisfaction and release of judgment" document from the judgment creditor. This document affirms that the judgment debtor has fulfilled any obligations relating to the judgment. For example, in California, a judgment creditor must file an "Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment"The Judicial Branch of California, SC-290 Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc290.pdf. where it has been paid in full by the judgment debtor within 15 days of the judgment debtor's request.California Code of Civil Procedure, C.C.P. § 724.005. This document has the effect of formally closing the caseCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure, C.C.P. § 724.003. and terminating any ongoing garnishment arrangements or liens.California Code of Civil Procedure, C.C.P. § 706.027. In Saskatchewan, upon either the satisfaction or withdrawal of a judgment, a judgment debtor can seek a discharge of judgment.The Enforcement of Money Judgments Regulations, R.R.S. ch. E-9 22, Reg 1, s 11(1) (Can.). If successful, the judgment is removed from the Judgment Registry and detached from any property registered on the Personal Property registry, titles, or interests in land.The Enforcement of Money Judgments Regulations, R.R.S. ch. E-9 22, Reg 1, s 11(2) (Can.). The requirements for judgments share many similarities and some differences between countries and legal systems. For instance, while the civil law imposes a statutory requirement to provide reasons for judgment, the common law recognizes a contextual duty to provide reasons depending on certain circumstances. The following section provides some information regarding judgments in different jurisdictions as well as examples of their treatment of other types of judgments, where available.  Canada (excluding Quebec) The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized a common law duty to provide "adequate" reasons for judgment and has stated that "the giving of reasoned judgments is central to the legitimacy of judicial institutions in the eyes of the public."R. v. Sheppard, 2002 S.C.C. 26 at para. 5, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869. Determining whether reasons for judgment are adequate is a contextual exercise that may call for different information or depth of reasoning based on the circumstances of the case.R. v. Sheppard, 2002 S.C.C. 26 at para. 19, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869. In general, Canadian courts are expected to provide reasons for judgment as a duty to the public at large,R. v. Sheppard, 2002 S.C.C. 26 at para. 22, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869. to demonstrate that the judge or judges have engaged with the parties' pleadings,R. v. Sheppard, 2002 S.C.C. 26 at para. 23, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869. to explain why the parties won or lost,R. v. Sheppard, 2002 S.C.C. 26 at para. 24, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869. and to allow for meaningful appellate review (in the event that the case may be appealed).R. v. Sheppard, 2002 S.C.C. 26 at para. 25, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869. With the above guiding principles in mind, Canadian courts must "read [the reasons] as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the arguments and the trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which they are delivered..." to determine whether the reasons for judgment are adequate.R. v. R.E.M., 2008 S.C.C. 51 at para. 16, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3. The reasons must tell the reader why the judgment was made, but do not need to tell the reader how the judge made the decision rendered in the judgment.R. v. R.E.M., 2008 S.C.C. 51 at para. 17, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3. Provincial rules of civil procedure provide further guidance relating to specific types of judgments. For example:  United Kingdom The Court of Appeal of England and Wales (Civil Division) has affirmed a common law duty to give reasons for a judgment, subject to some exceptions (such as an oral judgment or a summary judgment).Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd, [1999] E.W.C.A. Civ. 811 at para 12, [2000] 1 W.L.R. 377 (U.K.). The Court also noted that providing reasons for judgment "is a function of due process, and therefore of justice."Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd, [1999] E.W.C.A. Civ. 811 at para 14, [2000] 1 W.L.R. 377 (U.K.). Interested parties must be able to determine why the court has made the decision in question. Furthermore, providing reasons for judgment serves a practical purpose insofar as it necessarily requires the court to engage in thoughtful consideration of the cases presented.Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd, [1999] E.W.C.A. Civ. 811 at para 14, [2000] 1 W.L.R. 377 (U.K.). However, the Court also noted that the exercise of providing reasons for judgment is contextual and the standard of what is acceptable for a judgment will vary depending on the circumstances.Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd, [1999] E.W.C.A. Civ. 811 at para 14, [2000] 1 W.L.R. 377 (U.K.). The court appears to propose that the ultimate requirement is the court explaining, in some way, why it has made the decision in question.Flannery v Halifax Estate Agencies Ltd, [1999] E.W.C.A. Civ. 811 at para 14, [2000] 1 W.L.R. 377 (U.K.). Furthermore, The Civil Procedure Rules 1998The Civil Procedure Rules (1998), L. 17 (Eng.) (Last accessed March 28, 2015), https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules. state that a judgment or order takes effect on the day it is rendered unless the court specifies otherwiseThe Civil Procedure Rules (1998), L. 17, Rule 40.71 (Eng.) (Last accessed March 28, 2015), https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules. and provide additional guidance on different types of judgments.  United States At the federal level, a judgment is defined in the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as "a decree and any order from which an appeal lies" and does not include "recitals of pleadings, a master's report, or a record of prior proceedings."Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(a). A judgment must address all of the issues raised with respect to the rights and liabilities of the parties. If a judgment is rendered without addressing all the rights and liabilities, the action is not ended and the claims of the parties may be revised before the entry of a judgment that determines all of the issues raised.Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). A state Code of Civil Procedure provides its own rules relating to judgments in state courts. For instance, California's Code of Civil Procedure provides some general rules regarding the purpose of and requirements for judgmentsCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure, C.C.P. § 577-579. as well as rules relating to summary judgments,California Code of Civil Procedure, C.C.P. § 437.c-438. default judgments,California Code of Civil Procedure, C.C.P. § 1297.253. and interim or interlocutory judgments.California Code of Civil Procedure, C.C.P. § 1297.91-1297.95.  France A court's duties regarding judgments are outlined in the Code de procédure civile. A judgment "is given on behalf of the French people"Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), art. 454, Legifrance Translations (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation). and must contain certain information, including the date, the names of the judges, the level of court, and the names of the parties involved.Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), art. 454, Legifrance Translations (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation). A judgment must also describe the parties' claims and the grounds on which their claims are based, identifying both the final judgment and the reasons for the judgment.Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), art. 455, Legifrance Translations (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation). In light of compliance with the rules of the Code and the absence of an appeal, a judgment is presumed to have been executed correctly.Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), art. 461, Legifrance Translations (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation). Traditional French judgments often consisted of a single sentence wherein the court provided its judgment.Catherine Elliott, Eric Jeanpierre and Catherine Vernon, French Legal System 158 (2d. ed., Pearson, 2006). However, a drive towards modernization of French judgments has encouraged judges to write much clearer judgments to encourage simplification and accessibility.Catherine Elliott, Eric Jeanpierre and Catherine Vernon, French Legal System 158 (2d. ed., Pearson, 2006). Modern French judgments generally include "[a] recounting [of] the facts, the procedure and the claims of the parties, as a narrative ... Such judgments may also be divided to deal with each element of the claim separately."Catherine Elliott, Eric Jeanpierre and Catherine Vernon, French Legal System 162 (2d. ed., Pearson, 2006). Generally, French judgments are much shorter than their common law counterparts.Catherine Elliott, Eric Jeanpierre and Catherine Vernon, French Legal System 158 (2d. ed., Pearson, 2006). A court may either provide their judgment at the end of the hearing or defer the judgment to a specified date.Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), art. 450, translated at http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation). If an oral judgment is rendered, it must be read by at least one of the judges who heard the case.Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), art. 452, translated at http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation). Parties to the proceedings are entitled to receive "a certified copy of the judgement imprinted with an order of enforcement."Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), art. 465, translated at http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation). Once a judgment has been executed, it becomes res judicata.Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), art. 500, translated at http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation). A judgment will be enforced once it becomes final subject to some exceptions.Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), art. 501, translated at http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation). A judgment can only be enforced once a certified copy imprinted with an order of enforcement is provided and the affected parties have been notified.Code de procédure civile [N.C.P.C.] (Fr.), art. 503, translated at http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Traductions/en-English/Legifrance-translations (Select "Code of civil procedure-pdf" for English translation).  Germany A court's duties regarding judgments are outlined in the Zivilprozessordnung.Zivilprozeẞordnung [ZPO] [Code of Civil Procedure] (Ger.), translated at http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_zpo/englisch_zpo.html. A trial judgment must contain certain information, including the parties and their representatives, the court and judges involved in the decision, the date the proceedings finished, the merits of the case and the reasons for the judgment.Zivilprozeẞordnung [ZPO] [Code of Civil Procedure], § 313 (Ger.), translated at http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_zpo/englisch_zpo.html. Specifically, the legislation requires that "the claims asserted and the means of challenge or defence [be] brought before the court, highlighting the petitions filed. The details of the circumstances and facts as well as the status of the dispute thus far are to be included by reference being made to the written pleadings, the records of the hearings, and other documents ...

Once a judgment has been issued, the judge or judges determine whether the parties involved agree with the ruling. If one party disagrees with the judgment, that party has a set number of days to request a written appeal. An appellate body will then review the judgment in the absence of the parties.Hatem Abbas Ghazzawi & Co, Saudi Arabia – Law & Practice (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.chambersandpartners.com/guide/practice-guides/location/241/6622/1434-200. If the appellate body agrees with the lower court's decision, it will stamp "final and enforceable" on the judgment without providing any reasons and will return the judgment to the trial court.Hatem Abbas Ghazzawi & Co, Saudi Arabia – Law & Practice (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.chambersandpartners.com/guide/practice-guides/location/241/6622/1434-200. If the appellate body disagrees with the lower court's decision, it may either send the case back to the trial court for reconsideration or, less commonly, may call the parties to present further arguments and write its own judgment based on the information presented.Hatem Abbas Ghazzawi & Co, Saudi Arabia – Law & Practice (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.chambersandpartners.com/guide/practice-guides/location/241/6622/1434-200. Consent Judgment: also referred to as an "agreed judgment," a consent judgment is a settlement agreed upon by the parties and authorized by a judge.Black’s Law Dictionary 970 (10th ed. 2014). Consent judgments are often used in the regulatory context, particularly in antitrust and environmental cases.Robert B. Bell, Regulation by Consent Decree, 27 Antitrust 73 at 73 (2011-2012). Declaratory Judgment: a judgment that determines the rights and liabilities of the parties without enforcing a judgment or otherwise requiring the parties to do anything.Black’s Law Dictionary 971 (10th ed. 2014). A declaratory judgment may be useful where the parties have differing views about their rights and duties or are wishing to clarify them without seeking any other remedy. It has been suggested, at least in the United States, that a declaratory judgment is a "milder" form of an injunction order because it clarifies the parties' rights without actually directing the parties to do anything.Samuel L Bray, The Myth of the Mild Declaratory Judgment, 63 Duke L.J. 1091 at 1093 (2014). Though a declaratory judgment is not binding, it is expected that the parties will act in accordance with what the court determines in its judgment. Default Judgment: a judgment rendered in favour of one party based on the other party's failure to take action.Black’s Law Dictionary 507 (10th ed. 2014). Default judgments are commonly used where the defendant fails to appear before the court or submit a defence after being summoned.Black’s Law Dictionary 507 (10th ed. 2014). A default judgment grants the relief requested by the appearing party and does not require extensive factual or legal analysis from the court.Black’s Law Dictionary 507 (10th ed. 2014). Interlocutory Judgment: an intermediate or interim judgment providing a temporary decision on an issue that requires timely action.Black’s Law Dictionary 971 (10th ed. 2014). Interlocutory orders are not final and may either not be subject to appeal or may follow a different appeal procedure than other kinds of judgments.Capital Gains Income Streams Corporation v. Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., [2007] OJ No 2606 at para 32 (Can.). Reserved Judgment: a judgment that is not given immediately after the conclusion of the hearing or trial. A reserved judgment may be released days, weeks, or even months after the hearing.The Courts of British Columbia: Supreme Court, About Judgments (Last accessed March 28, 2015), http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/supreme_court/about_judgments.aspx. In the United States, a reserved judgment is sometimes annotated in law reports by the Latin phrase "Cur. adv. vult." or "c.a.v." (Curia advisari vult, "the court wishes to be advised").Black’s Law Dictionary 465 (10th ed. 2014). Summary Judgment: an accelerated judgment that does not require a trial and in which the court's interpretation of the pleadings forms the basis of the judgment.Black’s Law Dictionary 1664 (10th ed. 2014). For a summary judgment, the court will consider "the contents of the pleadings, the motions, and additional evidence adduced by the parties to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact rather than one of law."Black’s Law Dictionary 1664 (10th ed. 2014). Vacated Judgment: a judgment of an appellate court whereby the judgment under review is set aside and a new trial is ordered.Black’s Law Dictionary 1782 (10th ed. 2014). A vacated judgment is rendered where the original judgment failed to make an order in accordance with the law and a new trial is ordered to ensure a just outcome. The process of vacating a judgment is sometimes referred to as vacatur.Cornell University Law School - Legal Information Institute, Vacatur (Last Accessed April 21, 2015), https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/vacatur. The result of a vacated judgment is a trial de novo. Majority opinion: the opinion of more than half of the judges deciding a case.Black’s Law Dictionary 1266 (10th ed. 2014). This opinion becomes precedent for future cases as it represents the views of the majority of the court. Concurring opinion: the opinion of a single judge or judges that agrees with the final outcome of the majority opinion but disagrees in whole or in part with the reasoning.Black’s Law Dictionary 352 (10th ed. 2014). Plurality opinion: the opinions of different judges of the court when a majority judgment is not obtained.James F. Spriggs II & David R. Stras, Explaining Plurality Decisions, 99 The Georgetown L.J. 515 at 517 (2011).Black’s Law Dictionary 1266 (10th ed. 2014). An example of a plurality opinion is a court of three judges each rendering a different concurring decision, agreeing on a final outcome but disagreeing on the reasons justifying that final outcome. Dissenting opinion: the opinion of a single judge or judges that rejects the conclusions of the majority decision in whole or in part, and explains the reasons for rejecting the majority decision.Black’s Law Dictionary 1265 (10th ed. 2014).

(Last accessed March 28, 2015), https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules.
