 The Garden State Parkway (GSP) is a 172.4-mile (277-km) limited-access toll parkway that stretches the length of New Jersey from the New York line at Montvale to Cape May at the state's southernmost tip. Its name refers to New Jersey's nickname, the "Garden State." Most New Jerseyans refer to it as simply "the Parkway" or "the Garden State". The Parkway's official, but unsigned, designation is Route&nbsp;444. At its north end, the Parkway becomes the Garden State Parkway Connector, a component of the New York State Thruway system that connects to the Thruway mainline in Ramapo. The Parkway has been ranked as the busiest toll highway in the country based on the number of toll transactions. "The Garden State Parkway is America's busiest single tollroad in terms of toll transaction numbers - 609m in 2001 or 1.67m/day average." The parkway is the longest highway in the state.   The Garden State Parkway begins in Lower Township at an interchange with Route&nbsp;109 (traffic light at the southbound terminus). For the first three and a half miles, the Parkway crosses over streams. At , the Parkway crosses over Taylor Creek and enters Middle Township. Exit&nbsp;4 (signed 4A/4B southbound) is for Route&nbsp;47 North to Rio Grande and Wildwoods. At , Parkway exit&nbsp;6, for Route&nbsp;147 and North Wildwood, leaves to the right of the southbound lanes; there is no northbound exit, only an entrance, and no southbound entrance. There used to be three old at-grade interchanges (traffic lights) for Exits 9 to 11 which no longer exist.  Instead they were replaced with overpasses.  The first is at Exit&nbsp;9 to Shellbay Avenue. The second is Exit&nbsp;10 to County Route&nbsp;657, also known as Stone Harbor Blvd. The Cape Regional Medical Center, the county's only hospital, is at this exit. Exit&nbsp;11 is for U.S. Route&nbsp;9 at the Cape May County Park & Zoo. An unsigned southbound exit/entrance at East Mechanics Street was removed in August 2011, between Exits 9 and 10. In May 2009, guardrails were installed in between the northbound and southbound lanes from mile markers 7 to 11.5, due to the previous year's many fatal head-on crashes resulting from cars crossing the median. The at-grade interchanges were reconstructed to put the Parkway on overpasses above those roads, completed in July 2015. Because this work is finished, there are no longer any traffic lights or other intersections on the entire length of the Parkway. Exit&nbsp;13 is for Avalon Boulevard. At , the Parkway enters Dennis Township after crossing Uncle Aaron's Creek. At , exit&nbsp;17 leaves to the right for County Route&nbsp;625. At milepost 19.38, the Parkway enters its first toll, the Cape May Toll Plaza. A little more than  in, exit&nbsp;20 leaves for Route&nbsp;50. In Upper Township, exit&nbsp;25 leaves for County Route&nbsp;623. At , the Parkway enters Atlantic County. Just before exit&nbsp;29 (northbound only) for U.S. Route&nbsp;9, the Parkway enters the Great Egg Toll Plaza. Exit&nbsp;30 (southbound only) leaves to the right at milepost 30 for Laurel Road in Somers Point which leads to Ocean City via the Route&nbsp;52 causeway. Now in Egg Harbor Township, exit&nbsp;36 opens onto County Route 563 southbound and County Route 651 northbound. The northbound exit 36 serves as (indirect) access to the Black Horse Pike (US&nbsp;40/322). Exit&nbsp;37 (southbound) is the Parkway's interchange with County Route 608. This exit serves as (indirect) access from the southbound Parkway to the Black Horse Pike (US&nbsp;40/322) and the northbound direction of County Route 563. Exit&nbsp;38 interchanges with the Atlantic City Expressway.  Eastbound travelers on the expressway take the last few miles to Atlantic City.  Westbound travelers head for Camden and Philadelphia.  Now entering Galloway Township, U.S. Route&nbsp;30 interchanges with the Parkway at exit&nbsp;40. Exit&nbsp;41 is next, connecting to County Route&nbsp;561. Exit&nbsp;44 follows after Exit&nbsp;41, leading to County Route&nbsp;561 Alternate and County Route&nbsp;575. Just after exit&nbsp;48 for U.S. Route&nbsp;9 near the Mullica River and Bass River State Forest, the Parkway enters Burlington County. Exit&nbsp;50 is for Route&nbsp;9 as well, while exit&nbsp;52 is for Burlington County Route&nbsp;654.  Now in Ocean County, exit&nbsp;58 is for County Route&nbsp;539, exit&nbsp;63 is for Route&nbsp;72, and exit&nbsp;67 is for County Route&nbsp;554. Exit&nbsp;69 leaves to the right in both directions at milepost 70.45. Exit&nbsp;74 leaves to the right, which heads to Forked River. Exit&nbsp;77 is for Bayville. Exits&nbsp;80 (southbound only) is for county roads and U.S. Route&nbsp;9. Route&nbsp;9 then merges in for a few miles. Between exits&nbsp;80 and&nbsp;83, the Parkway has a concurrency with U.S. Route&nbsp;9 just south of the Toms River Toll Plaza.  It was from here that the Driscoll Expressway was to start (south of exit&nbsp;83) and run to the New Jersey Turnpike. CR 527 interchanges with the Parkway at exit 81. Route&nbsp;37 interchanges with the Parkway at exits&nbsp;82 and&nbsp;82A in Toms River. At exit&nbsp;83 (northbound only), U.S. Route&nbsp;9 leaves the Parkway and heads north. Exit&nbsp;89 comes at  for Route&nbsp;70 and County Route 528. In Brick Township, exit&nbsp;90 (northbound) and exit&nbsp;91 (southbound), leave for County Route&nbsp;549. At this point the road is in Monmouth County. Exit&nbsp;98 leads to Interstate&nbsp;195, Route&nbsp;34 and Route&nbsp;138. Exit&nbsp;100 leaves southbound for Route&nbsp;33. Route&nbsp;66 also exits northbound. Exit&nbsp;102, a southbound only exit leaves for Neptune Township.   Exit&nbsp;105 for Route&nbsp;18 (northbound only) and Route&nbsp;36 leading to Long Branch is the point at which all trucks are forced to leave the Parkway. At Exit 105, the Parkway divides into a local and express lanes configuration. The express lanes have no direct access to any exits, except for exit&nbsp;105 in Tinton Falls (southbound only) and exit&nbsp;117 in Hazlet. Exits&nbsp;109 and&nbsp;114 are for Red Bank and Holmdel. The next exit, exit&nbsp;116, is for the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel. Exit&nbsp;117 is for Routes 35 and 36. Exit&nbsp;117A (southbound only) is for Lloyd Road in Aberdeen. Exit&nbsp;120 is for Laurence Harbor Road and Cheesequake State Park. At this point, the road enters Middlesex County in Old Bridge Township. Southbound exits&nbsp;123 and&nbsp;124 leave to the right, but only on the local lanes. The express and local lanes merge and become one highway again shortly after. Northbound exit&nbsp;125 makes a sudden exit for Route&nbsp;35. Afterwards, the route crosses the Driscoll Bridge over the Raritan River. After the bridge, exit&nbsp;127 leaves for Routes 9, 440 and Interstate&nbsp;287. At milepost 129.5, the New Jersey Turnpike leaves to the right at exit&nbsp;129. Southbound exits&nbsp;127 and&nbsp;129 are merged into one exit, which is marked as exit&nbsp;129. A southbound only exit, exit&nbsp;130 is for U.S. Route&nbsp;1. The next three exits are marked 132 (complete), 131A (complete), and 131B (northbound only). The lettered ones are for Metropark, while exit&nbsp;132 is for Route&nbsp;27.  Exit&nbsp;135 is for Clark Township in Union County. Exits&nbsp;136 and&nbsp;137 are for Cranford Township and Route&nbsp;28. Exit&nbsp;138 is in Kenilworth for County Route&nbsp;509. Exits&nbsp;139A and&nbsp;139B are northbound exits only for a local road (Chestnut Street) and U.S. Route&nbsp;22. Exits&nbsp;140 and&nbsp;140A are for U.S. Route&nbsp;22 and NJ Route&nbsp;82. Exit&nbsp;141 is for Vauxhall Road and exit&nbsp;142 is for Interstate&nbsp;78. The 143s are for Lyons Avenue, exit&nbsp;144 is for Irvington and 145 is for Interstate&nbsp;280. Exit&nbsp;147 is for Springdale Avenue in East Orange, and exit&nbsp;148 is for Bloomfield Avenue in Bloomfield. Exits&nbsp;149, 150, and&nbsp;151 are for Essex County roads. Exits&nbsp;153A and&nbsp;153B are for Route&nbsp;3 and U.S. Route&nbsp;46 in Passaic County. As the Parkway leaves Clifton, it heads into Elmwood Park by crossing the Passaic River. Exit&nbsp;156, which comes before the river, is for U.S. Route&nbsp;46 and New Jersey Route&nbsp;20. There is also access to New Jersey Route&nbsp;21 just south of the interchange. Cedar Lawn Cemetery is also located northbound along 20 from exit&nbsp;156. As the Parkway continues to the northeast, it interchanges with Route&nbsp;46 again in Garfield. Riverside Cemetery is accessible off exit&nbsp;157 by going east along 46. At exit&nbsp;159, the Parkway interchanges with Interstate&nbsp;80 in Saddle Brook. Going southbound, there is also access to Bergen County Route&nbsp;67 (Midland Avenue). The Bergen Toll Plaza is next, before crossing over Saddle River County Park. Exit&nbsp;160 comes next, as the Parkway enters Paramus and interchanges with West Passaic Street, which heads to New Jersey Route&nbsp;208. Not far afterwards, at exit&nbsp;161 (northbound) is New Jersey Route&nbsp;4. Westfield Garden State Plaza is visible from the Parkway and is off exit&nbsp;161. Exit&nbsp;163 is for New Jersey Route&nbsp;17 in Paramus, which heads north to Ridgewood, Saddle River, Upper Saddle River, Ramsey and Mahwah before entering Rockland County, New York (on the southbound side of the Parkway, the exit is for New Jersey Route&nbsp;17 south toward the Meadowlands area and Hudson County). The Parkway goes between Paramus Park Mall and Bergen Regional Medical Center as it heads north. Just after, exit&nbsp;165 intersects for Bergen County Route&nbsp;80 (Oradell Avenue and East Ridgewood Avenue) in Paramus. The Parkway turns to the northwest and heads into the Pascack Valley Toll Plaza going northbound. There is a plaza southbound along the Parkway as well as exit&nbsp;166 for Bergen County Route&nbsp;110 (Linwood Avenue).  As the Parkway inches closer and closer to New York, exit&nbsp;168 comes along, interchanging for County Route&nbsp;502, which heads towards Ho-Ho-Kus and Alpine.  later, at exit&nbsp;171, the Parkway interchanges with Glen Road, which terminates soon after at Chestnut Ridge Road (CR 73). The Parkway's Montvale Service Area comes at milepost 171 after exit&nbsp;172 which is for Bergen County Route&nbsp;94. There is also access to CR 94 from the Montvale Service Area's service road. At , the Parkway becomes the Garden State Parkway Connector at the New York state line. Two short spurs are given numbers by the New Jersey Department of Transportation. Route&nbsp;444R is the connector at exit&nbsp;117 (in Hazlet) to Route&nbsp;35 at the north end of Route&nbsp;36 in Keyport. Route&nbsp;444S is the connector at exit&nbsp;105 to the south end of Route&nbsp;36 at Hope Road (CR 51) near Eatontown. On the Garden State Parkway, the emergency assistance number is #GSP, which is #477 in number form. New Jersey State Police are the primary police agency that handles  calls for service on the Parkway. Other emergency services such as fire and first aid are usually handled by the jurisdictions in which that section of the Parkway passes through.    Route S101 was a northern extension of Route 101 planned from Hackensack through Paramus to the New York state line near Montvale.  The section from Hackensack to Paramus was never built; the section from Paramus to the state line would become part of the Garden State Parkway. The Parkway was originally designated as the Route&nbsp;4 Parkway when it was started in 1947 in Union County, but, due to lack of funds, only  were completed by 1950. The solution was for the state to establish the New Jersey Highway Authority in 1952 to oversee construction and operation as a self-liquidating toll road. Much of the original section, between exits&nbsp;129 and&nbsp;140, was long administered by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and has always been untolled.  The segment can be distinguished by the stone facing on the overpasses. The Parkway was constructed between 1946 and 1957 to connect suburban northern New Jersey with resort areas along the Atlantic coast and to alleviate traffic on traditional north&ndash;south routes running through each town center, such as US&nbsp;1, US&nbsp;9, and Route&nbsp;35. Unofficially, it has two sections: the "metropolitan section" north of the Raritan River and the "shore section" between the Raritan River and Cape May. Only  had been constructed by 1950, but taking a cue from the successful New York State Thruway, on April&nbsp;14, 1952, the New Jersey Legislature created the New Jersey Highway Authority, empowered to construct, operate, and maintain a self-sufficient toll parkway from Paramus to Cape May. The landscape architect and engineer in charge of the newly named "Garden State Parkway" was Gilmore David Clarke, of the architectural firm of Parsons, Brinkerhof, Hall and MacDonald, who had worked with Robert Moses on the parkway systems around New York City. Clarke's design prototypes for the Parkway combined the example of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, a model of efficiency with parallels in the German Autobahn routes of the 1930s, with the Merritt Parkway model that stressed a planted "green belt" for beauty. Both design models featured wide planted medians to prevent head-on collisions and mask the glare of on-coming headlights. The Garden State Parkway was designed to have a natural feel. Many trees were planted, and the only signs were those for exits—there were no distracting billboards. Most of the signs were constructed from wood, or a dark-brown metal, instead of the chrome bars used on most other highways. The guardrails were also made from wood and dark metal. Most early overpasses were stone, but then changed to concrete, with green rails and retro etchings, popular around the 1950s and 1960s.  These are now in decay and being replaced by sleek, new bridges. The Parkway was designed to curve gently throughout its length so that drivers would remain alert and not fall asleep at the wheel. Most of the metropolitan section is like any other expressway built in the 1950s through heavily populated areas. The shore section parallels U.S. Route&nbsp;9 and runs through unspoiled wilderness in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. In Cape May County, the Parkway had three traffic lights (at exits&nbsp;8, 10, and&nbsp;11 respectively), but these were eliminated in 2015, with construction of an overpass at exit&nbsp;10 in Cape May Court House and Stone Harbor. The Parkway had an old alignment before the Great Egg Harbor Bridge was completed.  It was detoured onto U.S. Route&nbsp;9 and over the Beesley's Point Bridge.  Beesley's Point Bridge is currently under demolition. The Garden State Parkway was off-limits to motorcycles until Malcolm Forbes pushed successfully for legislation to allow them. On July&nbsp;9, 2003, Governor of New Jersey Jim McGreevey's plan to merge the operating organizations of the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike into one agency was completed. Literature from the time of the Parkway's construction indicates that the Parkway would become toll-free once bonds used for its construction were paid off. However, additional construction projects, plus the expectation that the Parkway will pay for its own maintenance and policing (and the massive E-ZPass project) make it unlikely it will become toll-free in the foreseeable future. The Parkway was also planned to be the southern terminus for NJ 55 at milemarker 19. This was cancelled after the conclusion that the highway ran through too many wetland areas. The idea is still being revisited after frequent traffic jams on NJ 47. On July 22, 2014, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority filed a federal lawsuit against Jersey Boardwalk Pizza, a pizza chain in Florida, for using a logo too similar to the signs for the Garden State Parkway.  The speed limit on the parkway is  with the following exceptions:  between mileposts 123.5 and 163.3,  between mileposts 80.0 and 100.0,  between mileposts 8.0 and 11.5, and  between mileposts 27 and milepost 29, approaching and traversing the Great Egg Harbor Bridge, and between milepost 126.7 and 127.7, approaching and traversing the Driscoll Bridge. Commercial trucks with a registered weight of over 7,000 pounds (3.18 metric tons) are not allowed to use the northern parts of the parkway. All trucks must exit at exit&nbsp;105, just past the Asbury Park toll plaza. From Tinton Falls to the southern end of the parkway at Cape May, trucks are allowed, but must pay additional tolls. Buses are allowed for the entire length of the parkway.Garden State Parkway Regulations, State of New Jersey, dated October&nbsp;23, 1987. Accessed October&nbsp;17, 2007. "19:8-1.9(b)15: All vehicles except cars, campers, omnibuses, and vehicles entitled to toll-free passage under N.J.A.C. 19:8-3.2 (Toll-free passage) are prohibited from the Parkway north of Interchange 105." The "truck" ban includes all vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (the vehicle's maximum fully loaded weight including fuel, passengers and cargo) over 7000 pounds, which encompasses dozens of large passenger vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Suburban, which can weigh in at 8,500 pounds, though in practice police do not ticket such vehicles.  In April 2011, New Jersey Transportation Commissioner James Simpson announced the NJTA was looking into the possibility of allowing trucks on the northern portion of the Garden State Parkway. However, the idea was quickly abandoned after the agency found the road had engineering concerns that would make the consideration of allowing trucks on this segment impossible.  Whereas the New Jersey Turnpike uses a system of long-distance tickets, obtained once by a motorist upon entering and surrendered upon exiting at toll gates (a "closed" system), the Garden State Parkway uses no tickets but collects tolls at toll plazas at somewhat regular intervals along its length and at certain exits (an "open" system). As of 2014, the standard car toll is $0.75 on the main road at two-way toll plazas and $1.50 at one-way toll plazas. Some individual exits require a toll of either $0.50, $0.75, or $1.50. The Parkway has implemented the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system, with the first plaza opening in December 1999 and the system completed September&nbsp;19, 2000. Parkway tokens continued to be available until January&nbsp;1, 2002, and were invalidated effective January&nbsp;1, 2009. Drivers using exact change lanes were now required to pay with coins only in all toll baskets. The Union Toll Plaza was the first to use an automated toll-collection machine. A plaque commemorating this event includes the first quarter collected at its toll booths. Tokens originally cost $10 for a roll of 40 tokens (the toll was 25 cents when tokens were introduced), but when the toll was increased to 35 cents, rolls were 30 tokens for $10. Before invalidating the tokens, the NJHA gave several months' warning and gave motorists the opportunity to redeem tokens. Tokens were originally brass, but were changed to a bimetallic composition with an outer silver-colored ring and a brass core. There were also larger bus tokens that existed in each composition, primarily for the use of Atlantic City-bound buses. These were sold in rolls of 20 for $20.  To reduce congestion, some toll plazas on the roadway were converted into one-way plazas between September 2004 and February 2010, dubbed "one-way tolling".NJ Turnpike and Garden State Parkway Project. Retrieved May&nbsp;11, 2011. Under this program, a $1.50 toll (70 cents or two tokens when first implemented from September 2004 to November 2008 and $1.00 was implemented from December 2008 to December 2011 which was the first phase of the toll increase) is collected in one direction, and the other direction is toll-free. The Cape May (in Upper Township), Great Egg (in Somers Point), New Gretna (in Bass River Township), Barnegat (in Barnegat Township),  Asbury Park (in Tinton Falls), Raritan (in Sayreville), Union (in Hillside Township), Essex (in Bloomfield Township), Bergen (in Saddle Brook Township), and Pascack Valley (in Washington Township) Toll Plazas had been converted to one-way toll plazas. The Toms River (in Toms River Township) Toll Plaza is the only $0.75 toll barrier plaza that is collected in both directions. Beginning on November 19, 2001, E-Z Pass customers were charged the approximate token rate, that is 33 cents (peak travel) or 30 cents (off-peak travel), instead of 35 cents. Due to tremendous cost overruns in implementing the E-ZPass system on New Jersey's toll highways the discount was eliminated the next year. NJHA E-ZPass customers were charged a $1-per-month account fee, causing many customers to turn in their NJHA E-ZPass transponders in favor of a transponder from an out-of-state authority which did not charge a monthly fee. On January&nbsp;8, 2008, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine proposed increases of fifty percent in tolls on the Parkway and Turnpike effective in 2010, to be followed by similar fifty percent increases every four years through 2022. Each time tolls increased, there would be an additional increase for inflation since the last toll increase (for the first, since 2006). This increase in tolls, which would take place on all three of New Jersey's toll roads, would, according to Corzine, help pay the state's debt. The roads would be maintained by a nonprofit "public benefit corporation" which would pay back bonds to the state. Without considering inflation, the proposal would have increased the standard 35-cent toll on the Garden State Parkway to approximately $1.80 by 2022, with tolls for the entire length of the northbound Garden State Parkway rising from $4.55 to $30.10 in 2022. It was considered possible that commuters will receive discounts from the higher toll rates. The proposal was not enacted due to fierce opposition from the state of New Jersey.  On September&nbsp;5, 2008, a proposal to increase Parkway tolls substantially was reported. The first phase of the toll increase on the Garden State Parkway went into effect on December 1, 2008. As of January 1, 2012, toll rates on the Garden State Parkway are $0.50 for ramp tolls, $0.75 for two-way toll barriers, and $1.50 for one-way toll barriers.Toll increase in effect on January 1, 2012 on the NJ Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway [ ] Retrieved December 17, 2011. There are three types of toll lanes at the toll plazas, however not all plazas have every type of lane at all times. The first are "E-ZPass only", which only accept vehicles with E-ZPass tags. The speed limit in these lanes is 15&nbsp;mph, or 55-65&nbsp;mph for Express E-ZPass lanes, depending on the Parkway's actual speed limit. The E-ZPass lanes were increased from 5&nbsp;mph to 15&nbsp;mph since August 2001. The second type of lane is "exact change". Although they previously accepted both Parkway tokens and/or exact change, the tokens were no longer in used after January 1, 2002 and were no longer accepted on the Parkway on January 1, 2009. Drivers using exact change lanes are now required to pay with coins only. In these lanes, motorists deposit coins in a toll basket and each coin is mechanically counted. Payment of tolls is enforced by photo, a system that went into effect on October 17, 2011.PAY TOLL Photo Enforced to all exact change lanes [ ] Retrieved October&nbsp;13, 2011. The third type of toll lane is "cash receipts". These lanes are manned; toll collectors can provide change and receipts to drivers. E-ZPass is also accepted.  One of the objectives of the Parkway was to become a State Park its entire length and its users would enjoy parklike aesthetics with minimal intrusion of urban scenery.  Along the ride, users were permitted to stop and picnic along the roadway to further enjoy the relaxation qualities the Parkway had to offer.  All picnic areas had tall trees that provided shade and visual isolation from the roadway.  Grills, benches, running water and restrooms were provided.  Over time as the Parkway transformed into a road of commerce, the picnic areas were being closed for a variety of reasons.  Their ramp terminals became insufficient to accommodate the high-speed mainline traffic and in addition to the decreasing amount of users, the picnic areas were becoming more effective as maintenance yards and were converted as so or closed altogether. The history of the picnic areas includes an infamous story in the murder of Maria Marshall orchestrated by her husband Robert O. Marshall in the Oyster Creek picnic area on the night of September 7, 1984.  The story was made into a novel and television movie on NBC. The three remaining picnic areas are closed from dusk to dawn.  Posted signs within the picnic area prohibit fires and camping. There were ten operational picnic areas: All service areas are located in the center median, unless otherwise noted. The first service area to open was Cheesequake on May&nbsp;1, 1955.  Prior to that grand opening, the New Jersey Highway Authority had constructed and operated two temporary service areas that offered only gasoline and other vehicular essentials. In the 1950s, four petroleum companies were hired to provide gasoline and vehicular necessities - Esso, Texaco, Atlantic and Cities Service.  The Cities Service company was the petroleum provider at Monmouth, Forked River, Atlantic City (Absecon at the time) and Ocean View (Seaville at the time) and offered a service where female employees were hired for those service area showrooms, wore uniforms and were known as the Park-ettes.  Their duties included providing directions and other information to motorists as well as rendering odd bits of service such as sewing a missing button on a patron's coat."The First Five Years of the Garden State Parkway" published by the New Jersey Highway Authority, page 29.  Many entrances and exits have tolls. In general, exits have tolls when they precede a barrier toll, and exits are free when they follow a barrier toll. Conversely, entrances that precede a barrier toll are free; and tolls are paid at entrances just beyond a barrier toll. This avoids double tolling (e.g., paying a barrier toll and then immediately paying again to exit) and under-tolling (e.g., driving a long distance and then exiting for free just before a barrier toll). There are no tolls between exits 127 and 141, inclusive, as this was the original road segment that predates the New Jersey Highway Authority.                                                                                                                   In the first half of the 1980s, exit&nbsp;171 was added in Woodcliff Lake, serving the mushrooming office complexes replacing farmland along nearby Chestnut Ridge Road.Photo of Exit 171 On May&nbsp;1, 1993, a travel center was opened at the Montvale Service Area, replacing one that burned to the ground in 1991.Travel Center Opens on Parkway In 2003, the Lakewood section received a brand-new southbound exit and northbound entrance, exit&nbsp;89. In order to expand the Parkway for the interchange, the Cedar Bridge Road bridge had to be torn down and rebuilt. The whole project was completed in November 2003 and cost about $16.23 million.Garden State Parkway Interchange 89 In Waretown, a $16.4 million project was completed for new bridges at exit&nbsp;69. The construction was completed in March 2007. Along with the new interchange came two new toll plazas. The Parkway was widened at the location it goes under County Route&nbsp;532.Garden State Parkway Interchange 69 The same company who did the exits&nbsp;69 and&nbsp;89 construction had also done work on exit&nbsp;100, 20 years before the exit&nbsp;69 construction. That project included demolishing all then-current bridges and building new ones along the newly rerouted Route&nbsp;66 and Route&nbsp;33. This project, in Tinton Falls, cost $21.67 million to complete.Garden State Parkway Interchange 100 Installation of Variable Message Signs along the Parkway began 1992 with the installation of approximately 25 Daktronics signs.  Some VM signs were installed on new sign structures while others were added to existing GO signs.  Initially, the signs were provided with telephone service.  A controller with a modem was installed in a cabinet near the signs.  Messages on the signs were changed manually using software on personal computers in the GSP headquarters building in Woodbridge. Tall Oaks (closed) - southbound only formerly at milepost 137 Madison Hill (closed) - northbound only formerly at milepost 134.9 Glenside (closed) - southbound only formerly at milepost 130.2 Telegraph Hill (open) - exit&nbsp;116 Herbertsville (closed) - southbound only; converted to a maintenance yard of the same name and heavy vehicle weigh station Polhemus Creek (closed) - northbound only formerly at milepost 87.2 Double Trouble (closed) - southbound only formerly at milepost 79.0 Oyster Creek - located in the median in Lacey Township. The facility is not signed from the mainline Parkway, but there are signs located within the picnic area that state the facility is closed from dusk to dawn and that fires and camping are prohibited similar to the signs posted at the other two picnic areas currently open.  The official Garden State Parkway website does not list Oyster Creek as a picnic area. It is possible that this picnic area has for all intents and purposes closed since this section of the Parkway is currently experiencing a major widening construction project and access to it is blocked and most likely will not reopen since the land used for widening the mainline was taken from the picnic area. Stafford Forge (closed) - located in the median at milepost 61.1 John B. Townsend Shoemaker Holly (Open) - located in the median at milepost 22.7. John B. Townsend was a physician from Ocean City who became the New Jersey Highway Authority's second Vice Chairman in 1955.  The word Shoemaker comes from the last name of the landowner in the way of the Parkway's alignment during its initial construction.  The term Holly comes from the Shoemaker's holly tree that was on his property.  The tree is presumed to be 300 years old and one of, if not, the oldest holly tree in the United States.Cape May County Points of Interest Montvale (Mile Post 171) Brookdale North - Fuel only.

Construction began in 2013 and continue into 2016. The new southbound bridge will be built to carry both northbound and southbound traffic so the northbound bridge can receive new decking and strengthening. The project includes the demolition of the abandoned Beesley's Point Bridge parallel to the Parkway, and the addition of mixed-use walkway along the new southbound Parkway span that will allow pedestrian and bicycle connections between Upper Township and Somers Point. A $25&nbsp;million interchange will be built as Exit&nbsp;41 at Jimmie Leeds Road, north of the Atlantic City service area. An access road currently connects the service area to Jimmie Leeds Road, which will be demolished and will be the future location of a new State Police facility. The project was completed in March 2015. Interchange 44 has been converted to a full interchange in Galloway Township, when the northbound exit and southbound entrance opened in August 2015. Governor Codey announced a widening of the Parkway in May 2005 between exit&nbsp;63 in Stafford Township to exit&nbsp;80 in the borough of South Toms River. The new Parkway setup would convert from the current two to become three lanes in both directions. However, the Turnpike Authority is now planning to widen the parkway from exit&nbsp;80 all the way south to exit&nbsp;30 in the city of Somers Point. As of 2015, the Parkway widening project from Exit 80 to 48 were complete while Exit 48 to 30 as the third phase is underway. Exit 89A from the southbound lanes has been added for access to Route 70 east (Brick) and 89B was converted to access to Route 70 west (Lakewood/Lakehurst). Exit 89C will access to County Route 528 towards Lakewood and Brick. Exit 89A from the northbound lanes is the access to Route 70 (Brick/Lakehurst) while 89B will access to County Route 528 towards Lakewood. Southbound entrances and northbound exits were added to make Route 70 a full interchange which was completed on June 12, 2015. Exits&nbsp;89 and&nbsp;90 in Lakewood will construct continuous auxiliary lanes. In the northbound direction, the on ramp from Interchange 89 will be continuous to the off ramp at Interchange 90 and in the southbound direction, the on ramp from Interchange 90 will be continuous to the off ramp at Interchange 89.  Overhead signing will be installed and the ground mounted signing will be removed.*Exit&nbsp;67 received a newly constructed southbound entrance ramp, and a northbound exit ramp. On March&nbsp;27, 2008, it was revealed that the new ramps would not have toll gates. Construction began in the summer of 2008 and opened on May&nbsp;20, 2009.Barnegat's interchange to open Wednesday May 20, 2009 Exit&nbsp;69 (in Ocean Township) was completely reconstructed. The old ramps were demolished, and a partial cloverleaf was constructed in its place. It now features a southbound exit ramp and a northbound entrance ramp. Toll gates were constructed at the southbound exit and northbound entrance ramps. This was finished in March 2007. As of 2014, Exit 80 to 48 was widened from two to three lanes in both directions. There are three phases of the Parkway widening. The first phase is from Exit 80 to 63 was complete in May 2011. The second phase is from Exit 63 to 48 was finished in July 2013. The third phase is from Exit 48 to 30 is underway and scheduled to be finished in either 2015 or 2016. A new diamond interchange, exit&nbsp;77 (in Berkeley Township) was constructed in 2006. Toll gates exist at the southbound exit ramp and the northbound entrance ramp. To avoid destroying part of the Double Trouble State Park, the southbound interchange was constructed approximately ½ mile north of the northbound interchange. Exit 88 was permanently closed on November 10, 2014 at 7:00 pm. Traffic for Route 70 will use a reconfigured Exit 89. Drivers exiting from the southbound lanes at Exit 89C for County Route 528 (Lakewood/Brick) while 89A for Route 70 East (Brick) and 89B for Route 70 West (Lakewood/Lakehurst). On June 12, 2015, drivers exiting from the northbound lanes at Exit 89A for Route 70 (Brick/Lakehurst) and 89B for County Route 528 (Lakewood). At exit&nbsp;98 in Wall Township, the overpasses carrying NJ 138 and I-195 over the Parkway have been replaced with newly constructed ones. This project was finished in late 2006. However, this project did not improve 195's exit&nbsp;35 for NJ 34. The Driscoll Bridge received a new southbound parallel span just west of the original span. This new southbound bridge boasts seven southbound lanes and emergency shoulders (currently the seventh lane is used as a northbound lane during rehab of the old spans). By 2010, a new northbound span will be constructed, consisting of eight northbound lanes and emergency shoulders. On May&nbsp;20, 2009, the Driscoll Bridge project was completed.Driscoll Bridge opening May 20, 2009 New overpasses and ramps were built at exit&nbsp;145 in the City of East Orange to connect to I-280. New E-ZPass lanes were also built at the interchange toll gate. Northbound at the Bergen Toll Plaza and southbound at the Raritan Toll Plaza are the only toll plazas that have the "PAY AHEAD" lanes. The Bergen Toll Plaza have one PAY AHEAD lane leading to a 2 right-lane toll plaza while the Raritan Toll Plaza have two PAY AHEAD lanes leading to a 4 right-lane toll plaza. The Parkway was widened in Wall Township from three to four lanes in the vicinity of Interchange 98 in both directions. On February 20, 2010, the Pascack Valley Toll Plaza in Washington Township began the one-way tolling program. With the northbound tolls being eliminated, the southbound tolls were doubled from $0.50 to $1.00.Pascack Valley One Way Toll Exit&nbsp;142 (in Union Township and Hillside) was upgraded with new ramps that now supply what were then missing movements between the Parkway and I-78, since I-278 was canceled between US&nbsp;1–9 in Linden and the interchange for NJ 24/I-78. On September&nbsp;17, 2009, a new exit ramp (from the Parkway north to Interstate&nbsp;78 west) was opened.NJTPA Online Transportation Information System -- Project Detail On December 10, 2010, the ramp between the southbound Garden State Parkway and eastbound I-78 opened. Overpasses have been constructed to eliminate the only at-grade crossings along the entire main line of the Parkway at interchanges 9, 10 and 11 in Middle Township. The traffic lights have been removed. Construction began in the winter of 2013, years after the scheduled start date due to a wetland mitigation plan that had not been approved by the federal government. The project cost $125 million, and was complete by Labor Day 2015. New bridges have been built across the Mullica River from the city of Port Republic to Bass River Township. Construction began in 2009 and was complete in 2015 as part of the Parkway widening project. Exit&nbsp;83 in Toms River has been reconfigured with improved northbound access via a new connector road/Lomell Lane. accessed June 18, 2007 The southern terminus of the roadway at Exit 0 in Lower Township is being reconfigured to reduce accidents and congestion and improve traffic flow at the tricky merge with Route 109. The project will add a new traffic signal and turn lanes along with improving the flow of traffic coming from the Cape May-Lewes Ferry turning north onto the Parkway. Construction is slated to be complete by the end of 2016. Exit 36 will be reconstructed to add a southbound exit deceleration lane and an acceleration lane on Tilton Road. There will be an elevated flyover that will separate the traffic entering the parkway at Exit 38 from the southbound traffic leaving the parkway at Exit 37 at Washington Avenue. Work is expected to be completed in 2018. Exit 83 could possibly get a southbound exit ramp. Exit&nbsp;91 (in Brick Township) will also be upgraded to a full interchange. Work started in 2013 and is expected to be complete in July 2016. Exit&nbsp;131A in Woodbridge Township will be upgraded with new ramps.
