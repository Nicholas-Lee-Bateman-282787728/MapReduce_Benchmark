     Operation Blue Star was an Indian military operation which occurred between 3 June and 8 June 1984, ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in order to establish control over the Harmandir Sahib Complex in Amritsar, Punjab, and remove Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed followers from the complex buildings. Bhindranwale had earlier taken residence in Harmandir Sahib and made it his headquarters in April 1980. The operation had two components—Operation Metal, confined to the Harmandir Sahib complex, and Operation Shop, which raided the Punjabi countryside to capture any suspects.Sangat Singh, The History of Sikhs: 1995, p. 382. Following it, Operation Woodrose was launched in the Punjab countryside where Sikhs, specifically those carrying a kirpan and protesting,  were now targeted. The operation was carried out by Indian Army troops with tanks, artillery, helicopters, armored vehicles and tear gas.Sangat Singh, The Sikhs in History. Casualty figures of Operation Blue Star given by Kuldip Singh Brar put the number of deaths among the Indian army at 83 and injuries at 220. According to the official estimate presented by the Indian government, 492 civilians were killed, though numbers put forward by independent human rights organizations are significantly higher. In addition, the CBI is considered responsible for seizing historical artifacts and manuscripts in the Sikh Reference Library, before burning it down. The military action led to an uproar amongst Sikhs worldwide and the increased tension following the action led to assaults on members of the Sikh community within India. Many Sikh soldiers in the Indian army mutinied, many Sikhs resigned from armed and civil administrative office and several returned awards and honours they had received from the Indian government. Four months after the operation, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by Satwant Singh and Beant Singh who were her two Sikh bodyguards, in what is viewed as an act of vengeance. Subsequently, more than 3,000 Sikhs were killed in the ensuing anti-Sikh riots in 1984. Within the Sikh community itself, Operation Blue Star has taken on considerable historical significance and is often compared to what Sikhs call "the great massacre", following the invasion by the Emir of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Durrani, the Sikh holocaust of 1762. The main political aim for Sant Jarnail Singh Ji Khalsa Bhindranwale and his followers he was associated with during June 1984 was to pass the Anandpur Resolution and not explicitly or solely for a separate country of KhalistanGlobalization and Religious nationalism in India: The Search for Ontological Security by Catarina Kinnvall. Routledge, ISBN 978-1-134-13570-7. Page 119 as Indian media often heavily reported. Throughout his career Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale remained in contact with Indira Gandhi."The confusion in the Governor's house in Chandigarh was made worse by Mrs. Gandhi maintaining contact with Bhindranwale. Her go-between was the President of Punjab Congress, Raghunandan Lal Bhatia... This link, which was well known to officials, enhanced Bhindranwale's status and made the Indian administration even more reluctant to grapple with him." Bhindranwale had earlier taken residence in Harmandir Sahib and made it his headquarters in April 1980, when he was accused of the assassination of Nirankari Gurbachan Singh.India in 1984: Confrontation, Assassination, and Succession, by Robert L. Hardgrave, Jr. Asian Survey, 1985 University of California Press The Nirankari Baba, also known as Baba Gurbachan, had been the target of an attack by followers of Bhindranwale, outside Harmandir Sahib. On 13 April 1978, Nirankari's Baba Gurbachan is alleged to have ridiculed 10th Guru Gobind Singh in a Nirankari Convention held in Amritsar. This prompted Akhand Kirtani Jatha to lead a protest against the Baba Gurbachan. Both sides clashed with each other and in the ensuing violence, several people were killed: two of Bhindranwale's followers, eleven members of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and three Nirankaris.http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/nightsoffalsehood/falsehood4.htm In 1982, Bhindranwale and approximately 200 armed followers moved into a guest-house called the Guru Nanak Niwas, in the precinct of Harmandir Sahib. From here he met and was interviewed by international television crews. By 1983, Harmandir Sahib became a fort for a large number of militants.Mark Tully and Satish Jacob, Amritsar&nbsp;– Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle (Calcutta: Rupa & Co. by arrangement with Pan Books, London, 1985) On 23 April 1983, the Punjab Police Deputy Inspector General A. S. Atwal was shot dead as he left the Harmandir Sahib compound. The following day, after the murder, Harchand Singh Longowal (then president of Shiromani Akali Dal) confirmed the involvement of Bhindranwale in the murder.Longowal said "Whenever the situation becomes ripe for settlement, some violent incident takes place. I know Bhindranwale is behind the murder of the DIG", "(The person behind the murder is) The one who is afraid of losing his seat of power" Harmandir Sahib compound and some of the surrounding houses were fortified. The Statesman reported on 4 July that light machine guns and [[semi-automatic rifle]]<nowiki/>s were known to have been brought into the compound.<ref>Kuldip Nayar and Khushwant Singh, Tragedy of Punjab, Vision Books, New Delhi, 1984, page 79.</ref> Faced with imminent army action and with the foremost Sikh political organisation, Shiromani Akali Dal (headed by Harchand Singh Longowal), abandoning him, Bhindranwale declared "This bird is alone.

The objective of the 10 Guards was to secure the northern wing of the Temple complex and draw attention away from SFF who were to secure the western wing of the complex and 1 Para Commandos who were to gain a foothold in Akal Takht and in Harmandir Sahab, with the help of divers. 26 Madras was tasked with securing the southern and the eastern complexes, and the 9 Kumaon regiment with SGPC building and Guru Ramdas Serai. 12 Bihar was charged with providing a cordon and fire support to the other regiments by neutralising enemy positions under their observance.<ref>Brar, K.S. (1992). Operation Blue Star: True Story. UBS Publishers Distributors (P), Limited. pp. 61. ISBN 81-7476-068-7.</ref>  As the troops entered the temple from the Northern entrance, they were gunned down by light machine-gun fire from both sides of the steps. The few commandos who did get down the steps were driven back by a barrage of fire from the building on the south side of the sacred pool, and thus they failed to reach the pavement around the Sacred Pool. The commandos and SFF inched pillar by pillar to reach the western wing where they came under fire from Harmandir Sahib itself. They were under strict instructions not to fire at Harmandir Sahib, the sanctum sanctorum, and instead told to focus on Akal Takth.  An initial attempt by the commandos to gain a foothold at Darshani Deori failed as they came under devastating fire, after which several further attempts were made with varying degrees of success. Eventually, other teams managed to reach Darshani Deori, a building north of the Nishan Sahib, and started to fire at the Akal Takth and a red building towards its left, so that the SFF troops could get closer to the Darshani Deori and fire gas canisters at Akal Takth. The canisters bounced off the building and affected the troops instead.  Meanwhile, 26 Madras and 9 Garhwal Rifles (reserve troops) had come under heavy fire from the Langar rooftop, Guru Ramdas Serai and the buildings in the vicinity. Moreover, they took a lot of time in forcing open the heavy Southern Gate, which had to be shot open with tank fire. This delay caused a lot of casualties among the Indian troops fighting inside the complex. Three tanks and an APC had entered the complex.  Crawling was impossible as Shabeg Singh had placed light machine guns nine or ten inches above the ground. The attempt caused many casualties among the Indian troops. A third attempt to gain the Pool was made by a squad of 200 troops from both the commandos and the Guards. On the southern side, the Madras and Garhwal battalions were not able to make it to the pavement around the pool because they were engaged by positions on the southern side.  Despite the mounting casualties, General Sunderji ordered a fourth assault by the commandos. This time, the Madras battalion was reinforced with two more companies of the 7th Garhwal Rifles under the command of General [[Kuldip Singh Brar]]. However, the Madras and Garhwal troops under Brigadier A. K. Dewan once again failed to move towards the parikarma (the pavement around the pool).  Brigadier Dewan reported heavy casualties and requested more reinforcements. General Brar sent two companies of 15 Kumaon Regiment. This resulted in yet more heavy casualties, forcing Brigadier Dewan to request tank support. As the APC inched closer to the Akal Takth it was hit with an anti-tank [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]], which immediately immobilized it. Brar also requested tank support. The tanks received the clearance to fire their main guns (105&nbsp;mm [[high-explosive squash head]] shells) only at around 7:30&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brar|first=K.S.|date=1992|title=Operation Blue Star: True Story|publisher=UBS Publishers Distributors (P) Limited|pages=81–110|isbn=81-7476-068-7}}</ref>  === June 6 === Vijayanta tanks shelled the [[Akal Takht|Akal Takhat]].

The high casualty rates among security forces were attributed to "the presence of such sophisticated weapons as medium machine guns and rockets" in the militants arsenal.<ref>{{citation|title=Golden Temple Sikhs Surrender|author=Eric Silver| work=The Guardian|date=7 June 1984}}</ref>  Chellaney also reported that several suspected Sikh militants had been shot with their hands tied.<ref name=tiedandshot>{{cite news | last = Chellaney |first = Brahma | title = Sikhs in Amritsar 'tied up and shot'| work = The Times| date = 14 June 1984| url =| accessdate =26 December 2008}}</ref> The dispatch, after its first paragraph reference to “several” such deaths, specified later that about “eight to 10” men had been shot in that fashion.<ref name=shotpointblank>{{cite news | last = Chellaney |first = Brahma | title = Sikh rebels were shot 'at point-blank range'| work = The Times| date = 14 June 1984| url =| accessdate =2 December 2008}}</ref> In that dispatch, Mr. Chellaney interviewed a doctor who said he was picked up by the army and forced to conduct postmortems despite the fact he had never done any postmortem examination before.<ref name=tiedandshot/> The number of casualties reported by Mr. Chellaney were far more than government reports,<ref name=underestimated>{{cite news | title = Toll in assault on Sikh Temple termed vastly underestimated | work = The Miami Herald| date = 11 June 1984| url =| accessdate = 26 December 2008}}</ref> and the Indian government, which disputed his casualty figures,<ref name=govtreaction1>{{cite news | title = Indian Police Question Reporter on Amritsar | agency = Associated Press| work = The New York Times| date = 24 November 1984| url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E6DA1638F937A15752C1A962948260| accessdate =14 January 2009}}</ref> accused him of inflammatory reporting.<ref name=govtreaction2>{{cite news | title = India is set to drop prosecution of AP reporter in Punjab Case | agency = Associated Press| page =5| work = The New York Times | date = 14 September 1985| url =http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F11FC3D5D0C778DDDA00894DD484D81| accessdate =14 January 2009}}</ref> The Associated Press stood by the reports and figures, the accuracy of which was also "supported by [[India]]n and other press accounts" and by reports in ''[[The Times]]'' and the [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']].<ref name=reportsverified>{{cite news | last = Stevens | title = India is said to drop prosecution of A.

Gill]] five years later in [[Operation Black Thunder]], when Sikh militants had again taken over the temple complex, was highly successful as they managed to resolve the stand-off peacefully and in hindsight, Operation Blue Star could have been averted by using similar blockade tactics. The army responded by stating that "no comparison is possible between the two situations", as "there was no cult figure like Bhindranwale to idolise, and no professional military general like [[Shahbeg Singh]] to provide military leadership" and "the confidence of militants having been shattered by Operation Blue Star".<ref name=brar/> Furthermore, it is pointed out that the separatists in the temple were armed with [[machine guns]], [[anti tank missile]]s and [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launchers]], and that they strongly resisted the army's attempts to dislodge them from the shrine, appearing to have planned for a long standoff, having arranged for water to be supplied from wells within the temple compound and had stocked food provisions that could have lasted months.<ref name=brar/>{{rp|153–154}}  ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' correspondent Chand Joshi alleged that the army units "acted in total anger" and shot down all the suspects rounded up from the temple complex.<ref>Chand Joshi, Bhindrawale: Myth and Reality, page 160</ref> [[Mark Tully]] and Satish Jacob criticized the Army for burning down the [[Sikh Reference Library]] in ''Amritsar: Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle'', stating that this was done to destroy the culture of the Sikhs.
