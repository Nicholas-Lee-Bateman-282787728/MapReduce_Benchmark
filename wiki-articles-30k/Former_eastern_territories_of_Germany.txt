     The former eastern territories of Germany () are those provinces or regions east of the current eastern border of Germany (the Oder–Neisse line) which were lost by Germany after World War I and then World War II. The territories lost following World War I include most of the Province of Posen and West Prussia, and further territories lost after World War II include East Prussia, Farther Pomerania, East Brandenburg, Upper Silesia, and almost all of Lower Silesia. All territories lost in both World Wars account for 33% of the former German Empire, while land ceded by Germany after World War II constituted roughly 25% of its pre-war Weimar territory."The Lost German East: Forced Migration and the Politics of Memory, 1945-1970" by Andrew Demshuk, page 52 In present-day Germany, the term usually refers only to the territories lost in World War II,see for example msn encarta: "diejenigen Gebiete des Deutschen Reiches innerhalb der deutschen Grenzen von 1937", Meyers Lexikon online: "die Teile des ehemaligen deutschen Reichsgebietes zwischen der Oder-Neiße-Linie im Westen und der Reichsgrenze von 1937 im Osten". Archived 2009-10-31. while in Poland the territories acquired from Germany after World War II were dubbed the "Recovered Territories" by the Soviet-installed Polish government. The post-war border between Germany and Poland along the Oder–Neisse line was formally recognized by East Germany in 1950 by the Treaty of Zgorzelec, under pressure from Stalin.  In 1952, recognition of the Oder–Neisse line as a permanent boundary was one of Stalin's conditions for the Soviet Union to agree to a reunification of Germany (see Stalin Note).  The offer was rejected by West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.  The official German government position on the status of former eastern territories of Germany vacated by settled German communities east of the Oder and Neisse rivers was that the areas were "temporarily under Polish [or Soviet] administration." In 1970, West Germany recognised the line as a de facto boundary in the Treaty of Warsaw. In 1990, as part of the reunification of Germany, West Germany recognised the "facts on the ground" and accepted clauses in the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany whereby Germany renounced all claims to territory east of the Oder-Neisse line.The problem with the status of these territories was that in 1945 the concluding document of the Potsdam Conference was not a legally binding treaty, but a memorandum between the USSR, the USA and the UK. It regulated the issue of the eastern German border, which was to be the Oder-Neisse line, but the final article of the memorandum said that the final decisions concerning Germany were subject to a separate peace treaty.  This treaty was signed in 1990 under the name of Treaty on the Final Settlement by both the German states and ratified in 1991 by the united Germany.  This ended the legal limbo state which meant that for 45 years, people on both sides of the border could not be sure whether the settlement reached in 1945 might be changed at some future date. Germany's recognition of the Oder-Neisse line as the border was formalised by the re-united Germany in the German-Polish Border Treaty on November 14, 1990.  In the Potsdam Agreement the description of the territories transferred is "The former German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line", and permutations on this description are the most commonly used to describe any former territories of Germany east of the  Oder-Neisse line. The name East Germany, a political term, used to be the common colloquial English name for the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and mirrored the common colloquial English term for the other German state of West Germany. When focusing on the period before World War II, "eastern Germany" is used to describe all the territories east of the Elbe (East Elbia), as reflected in the works of sociologist Max Webe[[Max Weber|r]] and political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]],<ref>Cornfield, Daniel B. and '' ''Hodson, Randy'' ''(2002).''

In German there is only one usual term ''Ostdeutschland'', meaning East Germany or Eastern Germany, the German rather ambiguous term never gained prevailing use for the GDR as did the English term. Since the ''Ostdeutschland'' has been used to denote the post-war and the respective five [[States of Germany|states]] of the [[German reunification|reunited Germany]]. However, because people and institutions in the states, traditionally considered as [[Middle Germany]], like the three southern new states [[Saxony-Anhalt]], the [[Free State of Saxony]] and the [[Free State of Thuringia]], still use the term Middle Germany when referring to their area and its institutions the term ''Ostdeutschland'' is still ambiguous.<ref>The public broadcaster run by the [[States of Germany|German states]] of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia is named [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]] (lit. in {{lang-en|Middle German broadcast}}), a regional newspaper, issued in [[Halle/Saale|Halle upon Saale]], is called "Mitteldeutsche Zeitung" and a Protestant [[Landeskirche|regional church body]] in the area, just recently founded by a merger, is named [[Evangelische Kirche in Mitteldeutschland]] ({{lang-en|Protestant Church in Middle Germany}}).</ref>  ==History ==  ===Foundation of German Empire, 1871=== [[Image:Acprussiamap2.gif|thumb|right|Growth of Brandenburg-Prussia (1600&ndash;1795).]] At the time of the foundation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871, [[Kingdom of Prussia]] was the largest and dominant part of the empire. Prussian territories included territories taken by Prussia in the three [[Partitions of Poland]] in the 18th century: [[East Brandenburg]], [[Silesia]], [[Pomerania]] and the provinces of [[Province of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Poznań]] (Posen). Later, these territories would come to be called in Germany "Ostgebiete des deutschen Reiches" (Eastern territories of the German Empire).  ===Treaty of Versailles, 1919=== [[File:Border changes in history of Poland.png|thumb|300px|Border changes in history of Poland]] [[Image:Polish language1880.png|thumb|German atlas from 1880 showing the spread of languages.]] [[Image:Bevölkerungsverteilung Ostmitteleuropa um 1918.jpg|thumb|Polish atlas showing ethnic groups in 1918.]] The [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919 that ended [[World War I]] restored the independence of Poland, known as the [[Second Polish Republic]], and Germany was compelled to cede territories to it, most of which were taken by Prussia in the three Partitions of Poland, and had been part of the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire for over 100 years. The territories ceded to Poland in 1919 were those with an apparent Polish majority, such as the [[Province of Posen]], the east-southern part of [[Upper Silesia]] and the [[Polish Corridor]].  Land transfers in Central Europe as a result of Versailles included: * Most of [[Greater Poland]] ("Province of Posen") and [[Pomerelia]] (parts of [[West Prussia]]), mostly what the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] had taken in the Partitions of Poland was handed over to Poland after the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)|Greater Poland Uprising]] (this land comprised an area of 53,800&nbsp;km² 4,224,000 inhabitants (1931) including 510&nbsp;km² and 26,000 inhabitants from [[Upper Silesia]]).<ref name="Versailles1">The German population in those areas in 1921 was 16.7% in the Poznań region (1910: 27.1%), and 18.8% in the area of Polish [[Pomorze]] (1910: 42.5%).

However, as distinct from other lost Czechoslovakian domains, it was not attached to [[Sudetengau]] (administrative region covering [[Sudetenland]]) but to Prussia ([[Upper Silesia]]).  By late 1938, [[Lithuania]] had lost control over the situation in the [[Klaipėda Region|Memel Territory]]. In the early hours of 23 March 1939, after a political ultimatum caused a Lithuanian delegation to travel to Berlin, the Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Juozas Urbšys]] and his German counterpart [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] signed the ''[[Treaty of the Cession of the Memel Territory to Germany]]'' in exchange for a Lithuanian Free Zone in the port of Memel, using the facilities erected in previous years.  ===German occupation of Poland in World War II, 1939–1945=== [[Image:Germany1941.png|thumb|Map of Reichsgaue in 1941]] {{Main|Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany}} Between the two world wars, many in Germany claimed that the territory ceded to Poland in  1919&ndash;1922 should be returned to Germany. This claim was one of the justifications for the German [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland in 1939]], heralding the start of the [[Second World War]]. The Third Reich annexed the former German lands, comprising the "[[Polish Corridor]]", [[West Prussia]], the [[Province of Posen]], and parts of eastern [[Upper Silesia]]. The council of the [[Free City of Danzig]] voted to become a part of Germany again, although [[Poles]] and [[Jews]] were deprived of their voting rights and all non-[[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi]] political parties were banned. In addition to taking territories lost in 1919, Germany also took additional land that had never been German.  Two decrees by [[Adolf Hitler]] (October 8 and October 12, 1939) divided the annexed areas of Poland into  administrative units:  * [[Reichsgau Wartheland]] (initially [[Reichsgau]] Posen), which included the entire [[Poznań Voivodeship]], most of the [[Łódź Voivodeship]], five counties of the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1919&ndash;1939)|Pomeranian Voivodeship]], and one county of the [[Warsaw Voivodeship (1919–39)|Warszawa Voivodeship]]; *[[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia]] (initially Reichsgau West Prussia), which consisted of the remaining area of the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1919&ndash;1939)|Pomeranian Voivodeship]] and the [[Free City of Danzig]]; * [[Ciechanów District]] ([[Regierungsbezirk]] Zichenau), consisting of the five northern counties of [[Warsaw Voivodeship (1919–39)|Warszawa Voivodeship]] ([[Płock]], [[Płońsk]], [[Sierpc]], [[Ciechanów]], and [[Mława]]), which became a part of East Prussia; * Katowice District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz), or [[East Upper Silesia]] (''Ost-Oberschlesien''), which included [[Sosnowiec]], [[Będzin]], [[Chrzanów]], and [[Zawiercie]] Counties, and parts of [[Olkusz]] and [[Żywiec]] Counties.  These territories had an area of 94,000&nbsp;km² and a population of 10,000,000 people.  The remainder of Polish territory was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] (see [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]) or made into the German-controlled [[General Government]] occupation zone.  After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, the [[Bezirk Bialystok|district of Białystok]], which included the [[Białystok]], [[Bielsk Podlaski]], [[Grajewo]], [[Łomża]], [[Sokółka]], [[Volkovysk]], and [[Grodno]] Counties, was "attached to" (not incorporated into) East Prussia, whilst [[East Galicia]] ([[Distrikt Galizien]]), which included the cities of [[Lviv|Lwów]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk|Stanislawów]] and [[Ternopil|Tarnopol]], was made part of the General Government.  ===Potsdam Agreement, 1945=== {{Main|Potsdam Agreement}} Germany subsequently lost territories east of the Oder-Neisse Line at the end of the War in 1945, when international recognition of its right to jurisdiction over any of these territories was conditionally withdrawn. The "condition" mentioned was the Final German Peace Treaty, which was to set the actual border line, which may or may not have been the Oder-Neisse line. At Potsdam, the assumption by many was that a Final German Peace Treaty was imminent, but this turned out to be incorrect.  After World War II,  as agreed at the [[Potsdam Conference]] (which met from 17 July until 2 August 1945), all of the areas east of the Oder-Neisse line, whether recognised by the international community as part of Germany until 1939 or occupied by Germany during World War II, were placed under the jurisdiction of other countries.The relevant paragraphs in the [[Potsdam Agreement]] are:<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Osmańczyk |first=Edmund Jan  |title=Potsdam Agreement, 1945  |editor-first=Anthony |editor-last=Mango |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements: A to F |volume=1 | publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2003 |isbn=9780415939218 |pages=1829–1830 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDwDmuOEheIC&lpg=PA1829&pg=PA1829#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Krickus |first=Richard J. |year=202 |title=The Kaliningrad Question |edition=illustrated |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9780742517059 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sDOUZEEnHFUC&lpg=PA34&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q&f=false 34]–35}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Ryszard W. |last=Piotrowicz |first2=Sam |last2=Blay |first3=Gunnar |last3=Schuster |first4=Andreas |last4=Zimmermann |year=1997 |title=The Unification of Germany in International and Domestic Law |issue=39  |journal=German monitor |issn=0927-1910 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn=9789051837551 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=s82PHINkWHgC&lpg=PA48&pg=PA48&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false 48–49]|ref=harv}}</ref>  {{quotation|'''V.

The debate affected [[Cold War]] politics and diplomacy and played an important role in the negotiations leading up to the reunification of Germany in 1990. In 1990 Germany officially recognized its present eastern border at the time of its [[German reunification|reunification]] in the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]], ending any residual claims to sovereignty that Germany may have had over any territory east of the Oder-Neisse line.  Between 1945 and 1990 the government of [[West Germany]] referred to these territories as "former German territories temporarily under Polish and Soviet administration". This terminology was used in relation to territories of eastern Germany within the 1937 Germany border, and was based on the terminology used in the Potsdam Agreement. It was used only by the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]; but the Polish and Soviet governments objected to the obvious implication that these territories should someday revert to Germany. The Polish government preferred to use the phrase "[[Recovered Territories]]", asserting a sort of continuity because parts of these territories had centuries previously been ruled by ethnic Poles.  ===Expulsion of Germans and resettlement=== {{Main|Expulsion of Germans after World War II|Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II}} [[File:Marking Polish-German Border in 1945.jpg|thumb|Marking the [[Oder-Neisse line|new Polish-German border]] in 1945.]] With the rapid advance of the [[Red Army]] in the winter of 1944&ndash;1945, German authorities desperately evacuated many Germans to west of the Oder–Neisse line.

Germany's recognition of the border was repeated in the [[German-Polish Border Treaty (1990)|German-Polish Border Treaty]] on November 14, 1990. The treaties were made by both German states and ratified in 1991 by a united Germany. * The expansion of the [[European Union]] to [[Central Europe]] in 2004 enabled any German wishing to live and work in Poland, and thus east of the Oder-Neisse line, to do so without requiring a permit. German expellees and refugees became free to visit their former homes and set up residence, though some restrictions remained on the purchase of land and buildings.  * Poland entered the [[Schengen Area]] on December 21, 2007, removing all border controls on its border with Germany.  In the course of the [[German reunification]], Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] accepted the territorial changes made after World War II, creating some outrage among the [[Federation of Expellees]], while some Poles were concerned about a possible revival of their 1939 trauma through a "second German invasion", this time with the Germans buying back their land, which was cheaply available at the time. This happened on a smaller scale than many Poles expected, and the [[Baltic Sea]] coast of Poland has become a popular German tourist destination. The so-called "homesickness-tourism" which was often perceived as quite aggressive well into the 1990s now tends to be viewed as a good-natured nostalgia tour rather than an expression of anger and desire for the return of the lost territories{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}.
