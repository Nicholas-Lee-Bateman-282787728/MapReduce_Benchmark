    John Frederick Denison Maurice, often known as F. D. Maurice (29 August 1805 – 1 April 1872), was a major theologian of the Church of England, a prolific author and one of the founders of Christian Socialism. Since World War II, interest in Maurice has expanded."Frederick Denison Maurice." Encyclopaedia Britannica. Britannica Academic. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Accessed 03 Jan. 2016. John Frederick Denison Maurice was born in Normanton, Suffolk, on 29 August 1805, the only son of Michael Maurice and his wife, Priscilla. Michael Maurice was the evening preacher in a Unitarian chapel. Deaths in the family brought about changes in the family’s "religious convictions" and "vehement disagreement" between family members.Bernard M. G. Reardon, "Maurice, (John) Frederick Denison (1805–1872)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 3 January 2016. Maurice later wrote about these disagreements and their affect on him: Early education Michael was "of no little learning" and gave his son his early education.W. E. Collins, "Frederick Denison Maurice," in Typical English Churchmen: From Parker to Maurice, ed. W. E. Collins (SPCK, 1902), 327-360. Online at https://archive.org/details/typicalenglishch00colluoft. The son "appears to have been an exemplary child, responsive to teaching and always dutiful. He read a good deal on his own account, but had little inclination for games. Serious and precocious, he even at this time harboured ambitions for a life of public service."Bernard M. G. Reardon, "Maurice, (John) Frederick Denison (1805–1872)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 3 January 2016. Higher education in civil law For his higher education in civil law, Maurice entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1823 that required no religious test for admissions though only members of the Established Church were eligible to obtain a degree. With John Sterling Maurice founded the Apostles' Club. He moved to Trinity Hall in 1825. In 1826, Maurice went to London to read for the bar and returned to Cambridge where he obtained a first class degree in civil law in 1827.W. E.

During the 1827-1830 break in his higher education, Maurice lived in London and Southampton. While in London, he contributed to the Westminster Review and made the acquaintance of John Stuart Mill. With Sterling he also edited the Athenaeum. The magazine did not pay and his father had lost money which entailed moving the family to a smaller house in Southampton and Maurice joined them. During his time in Southampton, Maurice rejected his earlier Unitarianism and decided to be ordained in the Church of England.Bernard M. G. Reardon, "Maurice, (John) Frederick Denison (1805–1872)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 3 January 2016. Higher education in theology Maurice entered Exeter College in 1830 to prepare for ordination. He was older than most of students, he was very poor and he "kept to himself, toiling at his books". However, "his honesty and intellectual powers" impressed others.C. F. G. Masterman, Frederick Denison Maurice in series Leaders of the Church, 1800–1900 (1907), 16. Online at https://archive.org/details/frederickdenison00mastuoft In March 1831, Maurice was baptised in the Church of England. After taking a second class degree in November 1931, he worked as a "private tutor" in Oxford until his ordination as a deacon in January 1834 and appointment to a curacy in Bubbenhall near Leamington. He was ordained as priest in 1835.Henry Morley, Illustrations of English Religion (Cassell, Petter & Galpin, 1877), 421.

Being twenty-eight years old when he was ordained deacon, Maurice was older and with a wider experience than most ordinands. He had attended both universities and been active "the literary and social interests of London". All this coupled with his diligence in study and reading, gave Maurice a knowledge "scarcely paralleled by any of his contemporaries".C. F. G. Masterman, "Frederick Denison Maurice" in the series Leaders of the Church, 1800–1900 (1907), 19. Online at https://archive.org/details/frederickdenison00mastuoft Maurice’s ordination marked the transition between his formal education and his career as a priest and preacher, as a professor and lecturer and an author and social activist recounted in the rest of this article.   Except for his 1834-1836 first clerical assignment, Maurice’s career can be divided between his conflicted years in London (1836-1866) and his peaceful years in Cambridge (1866-1872) For his first clerical assignment, Maurice served an assistant curacy in Bubbenhall in Warwickshire from 1834 until 1836. During his time in Bubbenhall, Maurice began writing on the topic of "moral and metaphysical philosophy". Writing on this topic by "revision and expansion" continued the rest of his life until the publication of Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy, 2 vols in 1871–2, the year of his death.A.

In 1838, the first edition of The Kingdom of Christ was published. It was "one of his most significant works." A second enlarged edition was published in 1842 and a third edition in 1883. For Maurice the signs of this kingdom are "the sacraments of baptism and the eucharist, to which must be added the creeds, the liturgy, the episcopate, and the scriptures—in fact, all the marks of catholicity as exemplified in the Church of England." The book was met with criticism when published, a criticism "that lasted throughout Maurice's career."Bernard M. G. Reardon, ‘Maurice, (John) Frederick Denison (1805–1872)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 3 Jan 2016. Maurice served as editor of the Educational Magazine during its entire 1839-1841 existence. He argued that "the school system should not be transferred from the church to the state." Maurice was elected professor of English literature and history at King's College London in 1840. When the college added a theological department in 1846, he became a professor there also. That same year Maurice was elected chaplain of Lincoln's Inn and resigned the chaplaincy at Guy's Hospital,King’s College, London, "MAURICE, Professor Frederick Denison (1805-1872)" online at http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/kclca/collection/m/10ma85-1.

Queen’s College During his London years, Maurice engaged in two lasting educational initiatives: founding Queen's College, London in 1848 and the Working Men's College in 1854. In 1847, Maurice and "most of his brother-professors" at King’s College formed a Committee on Education for the education of governesses. This committee joined a scheme for establishing a College for Women that resulted in the founding of Queen’s College. Maurice was its first principal. The college was "empowered to grant certificates of qualification ‘to governesses’ and ‘to open classes in all branches of female education’."John William Adamson, English Education, 1789-1902 (Cambridge University, 1930/1964), 283. One of the early graduates of Queen’s College who was influenced by Maurice was Matilda Ellen Bishop who became the first Principal of Royal Holloway College.Caroline Bingham, ‘Bishop, Matilda Ellen (1842–1913)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 19 Jan 2016 On 4 July 1849, Maurice remarried, this time to Georgina Hare-NaylorBernard M.

Dismissed from King’s College "Maurice was dismissed from his professorships because of his leadership in the Christian Socialist Movement, and because of the supposed unorthodoxy of his Theological Essays (1853)."Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints (Church Publishing, 2010), 300. Online at http://diobeth.typepad.com/files/holy-women-holy-men.pdf. His The Kingdom of Christ had evoked virulent criticism. The publication of his Theological Essays in 1853 evoked even more and precipitated his dismissal from King’s College. At the instigation of Richard William Jelf, the Principal of the College, the Council of the College, asked Maurice to resign. He refused and demanded that he be either "acquitted or dismissed." He was dismissed. To prevent the controversy from affecting Queen’s College, Maurice "severed his relations" with it.A. Gardner, The Scottish Review, Volume 3 (1884), 351-353. Online at https://books.google.com/books?id=msgZmBVliCgC&source=gbs_navlinks_s. The public and his friends were strongly in support of Maurice. His friends "looked up to him with the reverence due to a great spiritual teacher." They were devoted to him and wanted to protect Maurice against his opponents.Leslie Stephen, ‘Maurice, Frederick Denison (1805–1872)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Vol XXXVII (Oxford University Press, 1894), 97-105.

In February 1854, he developed plans for a Working Men's College. Maurice gained enough support for the college by giving lectures that by 30 October 1854 the college opened with over 130 students. "Maurice became principal, and took an active part both in teaching and superintending during the rest of his life in London."Leslie Stephen, "Maurice, Frederick Denison (1805–1872)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Vol XXXVII (Oxford University Press, 1894), 97-105.

The issue was whether earlier Acts legalizing and policing prostitution for the armed forces should be repealed.

Grant Duff in his dairy for 22 April 1855, wrote that he "went, as usual about this time, to hear F.D. Maurice preach at Lincoln's Inn.

Grant Duff, Notes from a Diary 1851-1872, Volume 1 (London, John Murray, 1897), 78. John Henry Newman described Maurice as a man of "great power" and of "great earnestness". However, Newman found Maurice so "hazy" that he "lost interest in his writings."Edward Short Newman and His Contemporaries (Bloomsbury, 2011), 418. In the United States, The National Quarterly Review and Religious Magazine, Volume 38 (January 1879) contained this appreciation of Maurice. “Mr. Maurice’s characteristics are well known and becoming every year more highly appreciated—broad catholicity, keeness of insight, powerful mental grasp, fearlessness of utterance and devoutness of spirit.”The National Quarterly Review, Volume 38 (Pudney & Russell, 1879), 203.

Two of Maurice’s social activities have been recounted in Section 2.0 on his "Career," namely Queen's College, London and the Working Men's College. Two others are described in this section: Christian Socialism and the Society for Promoting Working Men's Associations. Christian Socialism Maurice was affected by the "revolutionary movements of 1848", especially the march on Parliament, but he believed that "Christianity rather than secularist doctrines was the only sound foundation for social reconstruction."King’s College, London, "MAURICE, Professor Frederick Denison (1805-1872)" online at http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/kclca/collection/m/10ma85-1. Maurice "disliked competition as fundamentally unchristian, and wished to see it, at the social level, replaced by co-operation, as expressive of Christian brotherhood." In 1849, Maurice joined other Christian socialist in an attempt to mitigate competition by the creation of co-operative societies. He viewed co-operative societies as "a modern application of primitive Christian communism." Twelve cooperative workshops were to be launched in London. However, even with subsidy by Edward Vansittart Neale many turned out to be unprofitable.Bernard M. G. Reardon, ‘Maurice, (John) Frederick Denison (1805–1872)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 3 Jan 2016. Nevertheless, the effort effected lasting consequences as seen in the following sub-section on the "Society for Promoting Working Men's Associations" In 1854, there were eight Co-operative Productive Associations in London and fourteen in the Provinces. These included breweries, flour mills, tailors, hat makers, builders, printers, engineers. Others were formed in the following decades. Some of them failed after several years, some lasted a longer time, some were replaced.The Co-operative Wholesale Society’s Annual, Almanack, and Diary for the Year 1883: Containing an Account of the the Statistics of the Society from Its Commencement in 1864, etc., Volume 1883 (Co-operative Wholesale Society [and] Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society, 1883), 174-180, 181. Maurice’s perception of a need for a moral and social regeneration of society led him into Christian Socialism. From 1848 until 1854 (when the movement came to an endHoly Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints (Church Publishing, 2010), 300. Online at http://diobeth.typepad.com/files/holy-women-holy-men.pdf.), he was a leader of the Christian Socialist Movement. He insisted that "Christianity is the only foundation of Socialism, and that a true Socialism is the necessary result of a sound Christianity."The Episcopal Church/Library/Glossary at http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/maurice-frederick-denison. Maurice has been characterized as "the spiritual leader" of the Christian Socialists because he was more interested in disseminating its theological foundations than "their practical endeavours."Leslie Stephen, ‘Maurice, Frederick Denison (1805–1872)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Vol XXXVII (Oxford University Press, 1894), 97-105. Online at https://books.google.com/books?id=GODzs6wrtdsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Maurice once wrote,Let people call me merely a philosopher, or merely anything else…. My business, because I am a theologian, and have no vocation except for theology, is not to build, but to dig, to show that economics and politics … must have a ground beneath themselves, and that society was not to be made by any arrangements of ours, but is to be regenerated by finding the law and ground of its order and harmony, the only secret of its existence, in God.Frederick Maurice, ed., The Life of Frederick Denison Maurice: Chiefly Told in His Own Letters, Vol. 2 (Macmillan, 1884) ,137. Society for Promoting Working Men's Associations Early in 1850 the Christian Socialists started a working men’s association for tailors in London, followed by associations for other trades. To promote this movement, a Society for Promoting Working Men's Associations (SPWMA) was founded with Maurice as a founding member and head of its a "central board." At first, the SPWMA’s work was merely propagating the idea of associations by publishing tracts. Then it undertook the practical project of establishing the Working Men's College because educated workers were essential for successful co-operative societies. With that ingredient more of the associations succeeded; others still failed or were replaced by a later "cooperative movement. The lasting legacy of the Christian Socialists was that, in 1852, they influenced the passage of an act in Parliament which gave "a legal status to co-operative bodies" such as working men’s associations. The SPWMA "flourished in the years from 1849 to 1853, or thereabouts."Leslie Stephen, ‘Maurice, Frederick Denison (1805–1872)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Vol XXXVII (Oxford University Press, 1894), 97-105.

The original mission of the Society for Promoting Working Men's Associations was "to diffuse the principles of co-operation as the practical application of Christianity to the purposes of trade and industry." The goal was forming associations by which working men and their families could enjoy the whole produce of their labour."Appendix to the Minutes of Evidence Taken Before the Royal Commission on Labour, One Volume" in Sessional papers.

In testimony from representatives of "Co-operative Societies" during 1892-1893 to the Royal Commission on Labour for the House of Commons, one witness applauded the contribution of Christian Socialists to the "present cooperative movement" by their formulating the idea in the 1850s. The witness specifically cited "Maurice, Kingsley, Ludlow, Neale, and Hughes."Sessional papers. Inventory control record 1, Vol 39 including the "Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Labour" (Great Britain. Parliament. House of Commons, 1894), 62.  That Maurice left a legacy that would be valued by many was harbingered by responses to his death. "Crowds following his remains to their last resting place, and around the open grave there stood men of widely different creeds, united for the moment by the common sorrow and their deep sense of loss. From pulpit and press, from loyal friends and honest opponents, the tribute to the worth of Mr. Maurice was both sincere and generous."The London Quarterly Review, Volume 62 (T. Woolmer, 1884), 348. Online at https://books.google.com/books?id=j9E5AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s. Personal legacy Maurice’s close friends were "deeply impressed with the spirituality of his character". His wife observed that whenever Maurice was awake in the night, he was "always praying." Charles Kingsley called him " the most beautiful human soul whom God has ever allowed me to meet with."The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volumes 17-18, Eleventh Edition (New York: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911), s. v.

Teaching legacy As a professor at King's College and at Cambridge, Maurice attracted "a band of earnest students" to whom he gave two things. He taught them from the knowledge he had gained by his comprehensive reading. More importantly, Maurice instilled in students "the habit of inquiry and research" and a "desire for knowledge and the process of independent thought."The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volumes 17-18, Eleventh Edition (New York: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911), s. v.

Reardon, Religious Thought in the Victorian Age (Longman Group UK, 1980), 158. By themselves, two of Maurice’s books, The Kingdom of Christ' (1838 and later editions) and  Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy (2 volumes, 1871-1872), are "remarkable enough to have made their writer famous."  But there more reasons for Maurice’s fame. In his "life-work" Maurice was "constantly teaching, writing, guiding, organizing; training up others to do the same kind of work, but giving them something of his spirit, never simply his views." He drew out "all the best that was in others, never trying to force himself upon them." With his opponents, Maurice tried to find some "common ground" between them. None who knew him personally "could doubt that he was indeed a man of God."W. E. Collins, "Frederick Denison Maurice," in Typical English Churchmen: From Parker to Maurice, ed. W. E. Collins (SPCK, 1902), 333, 358-359. In The Kingdom of Christ Maurice viewed the true church as a united body that transcended the "diversities and partialities of its individual members, factions, and sects". The true church had six signs: "baptism, creeds, set forms of worship, the eucharist, an ordained ministry, and the Bible." Maurice’s ideas were reflected a half-century later by William Reed Huntington and the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral.The Episcopal Church/Library/Glossary at http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/maurice-frederick-denison.  The modern ecumenical movement also incorporated Maurice’s ideas contained in his The Kingdom of Christ."Frederick Denison Maurice." Encyclopaedia Britannica. Britannica Academic. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Accessed 03 Jan. 2016. Decline and revival of interest in legacy Interest in the vast legacy of writings bequeathed by Maurice declined even before his death. Hugh Walker, a fellow academic, predicted in 1910 that neither of Maurice’s major works, his Theological Essays (1853) and his Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy (1871-72), will "stand the test of time."Hugh Walker, The Literature of the Victorian Era (Cambridge University, 1910), 101.

"Since World War II there has been a revival of interest in Maurice as a theologian."The Episcopal Church/Library/Glossary online at http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/maurice-frederick-denison.

Maurice’s writings result from diligent work on his part. As a rule he "rose early" and did his socializing with friends at breakfast. He dictated his writings until dinner-time. The manuscripts he dictated were "elaborately corrected and rewritten" before publication.Leslie Stephen, ‘Maurice, Frederick Denison (1805–1872)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Vol XXXVII (Oxford University Press, 1894), 97-105.
