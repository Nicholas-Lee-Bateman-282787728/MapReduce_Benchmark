   Division I (D-I) is the highest level of intercollegiate athletics sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States. D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers, with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities, and more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition. This level was once called the University Division of the NCAA, in contrast to the lower level College Division; this terminology was replaced with numeric divisions  in 1973.  The University Division was renamed Division I, while the College Division was split in two; the College Division members that either offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II, while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III. For football only, Division I was further subdivided in 1978 into Division I-A (the principal football schools) and Division I-AA; those schools not sponsoring football remained as simply Division I. In 2006, Division I-A and I-AA were renamed "Football Bowl Subdivision" (FBS) and "Football Championship Subdivision" (FCS), respectively. FBS teams are allowed a maximum of 85 players receiving athletically-based aid per year, with each player allowed to receive up to a full scholarship; FCS teams have the same 85-player limit as FBS teams, but are only allowed to give an amount of aid equivalent to 63 full scholarships. FCS teams are allowed to award partial scholarships, a practice technically allowed but essentially never used at the FBS level. FBS teams also have to meet minimum attendance requirements (average 15,000 people in actual or paid attendance per home game), while FCS teams do not need to meet minimum attendance requirements. Another difference is post season play. Since 1978, FCS teams have played in a college football playoff system to determine a NCAA-sanctioned national champion; the FBS teams play in bowl games where various polls rank the number one team after the conclusion of the bowl games. Starting with the 2014 postseason, a four-team playoff called the College Football Playoff, replaced the previous one game championship format. Even so, Division I FBS football is still the only NCAA sport in which a yearly champion is not determined by an NCAA-sanctioned championship event. For the 2014-15 school year, Division I contained 345 of the NCAA's 1,066 member institutions, with 125 in FBS, 125 in FCS, and 95 non-football schools with 6 additional schools in transition from Division II to Division I. There was a moratorium on any additional movement up to D-I until 2012, after which any school desirous of moving to D-I must first be accepted for membership by a conference and must show the NCAA that it has the financial ability to support a D-I program. All D-I schools must field teams in at least seven sports for men and seven for women or six for men and eight for women, with at least two team sports for each gender. Division I schools must meet minimum financial aid awards for their athletics program, and there are maximum financial aid awards for each sport that a Division I school cannot exceed. There are several other NCAA sanctioned minimums and differences that distinguish Division I from Divisions II and III. Each playing season has to be represented by each gender as well. There are contest and participant minimums for each sport, as well as scheduling criteria. For sports other than football and basketball, Division I schools must play 100 percent of the minimum number of contests against Division I opponents—anything over the minimum number of games has to be 50 percent Division I. Men's and women's basketball teams have to play all but two games against Division I teams; for men, they must play one-third of all their contests in the home arena. In addition to the schools that compete fully as D-I institutions, the NCAA allows D-II and D-III schools to classify one men's and one women's sport (other than football or basketball) as a D-I sport, as long as they had been sponsoring those sports prior to the latest rules change in 2011.In the news: June 7. Ncaa.org (2011-06-07). Retrieved on 2013-08-17. Also, Division II schools are eligible to compete for Division I national championships in sports that do not have a Division II national championship, and in those sports may also operate under D-I rules and scholarship limits. The NCAA has limits on the total financial aid each Division I member may award in each sport that the school sponsors. It divides sports that are sponsored into two types for purposes of scholarship limitations: The term "counter" is also key to this concept. The NCAA defines a "counter" as "an individual who is receiving institutional financial aid that is countable against the aid limitations in a sport." See also Bylaw 15.5.1, pp. 199–200, for a more comprehensive discussion of when an individual becomes a "counter" in most sports, and Bylaw 15.5.6.3, pp. 204-205, for a discussion of this concept specifically applying to football. The number of scholarships that Division I members may award in each sport is listed below. In this table, scholarship numbers for head-count sports are indicated without a decimal point; for equivalency sports, they are listed with a decimal point, with a trailing zero if required. The NCAA also has rules specifying the sport in which multi-sport athletes are to be counted, with the basic rules being: Division I athletic programs generated $8.7 billion in revenue in the 2009–2010 academic year. Men's teams provided 55% of the total, women's teams 15%, and 30% was not categorized by sex or sport. Football and men's basketball are usually a university's only profitable sports, and are called "revenue sports". The BYU Cougars, for example, in 2009 had revenue of $41 million and expenses of $35 million, resulting in a profit of $5.5 million or about 16% margin. Football (60% of revenue, 53% profit margin) and men's basketball (15% of revenue, 8% profit margin) were profitable; women's basketball (less than 3% of revenue) and all other sports were unprofitable. From 2008 to 2012, 205 varsity teams were dropped in NCAA Division I &ndash; 72 for women and 133 for men, with men's tennis, gymnastics and wrestling hit particularly hard.Maryland athletics' financial woes reveal a broken college sports revenue model, June 28, 2012, http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-06-28/sports/35459616_1_college-sports-maryland-athletics-public-universities In the Football Bowl Subdivision (125 schools in 2013), between 50 and 60 percent of football and men's basketball programs generated positive revenues (above program expenses).NCAA Revenues/Expenses Division I Report, 2004 - 2010, p. 13 However, in the Football Championship Subdivision (124 schools in 2013), only four percent of football and five percent of men's basketball programs generated positive revenues.NCAA Revenues/Expenses Division I Report, 2004 - 2010, p. 14 In 2012, 2% of athletic budgets were spent on equipment, uniforms and supplies for male athletes at NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision school, with the median spending per-school at $742,000. In 2014, the NCAA and the student athletes were in debate on whether student athletes should be paid. Student athletes felt that because of their hard work, hours spent on their sport, and the amount of money their sport brings in, they should be paid. In April, the NCAA approved students-athletes getting free unlimited meals and snacks. The NCAA stated "The adoption of the meals legislation finished a conversation that began in the Awards, Benefits, Expenses and Financial Aid Cabinet. Members have worked to find appropriate ways to ensure student-athletes get the nutrition they need without jeopardizing Pell Grants or other federal aid received by the neediest student-athletes. With their vote, members of the council said they believe that loosening NCAA rules on what and when food can be provided from athletics departments is the best way to address the issue."   Sports are ranked according to total possible scholarships (number of teams x number of scholarships per team). Scholarship numbers for head-count sports are indicated without a decimal point. Numbers for equivalency sports are indicated with a decimal point, with a trailing zero if needed. Notes: Notes: Subdivisions in Division I exist only in football. In all other sports, all Division I conferences are equivalent. The subdivisions were recently given names to reflect the differing levels of football play in them. The method by which the NCAA determines whether a school is Bowl or Championship subdivision is first by attendance numbers and then by scholarships.Football Bowl Subdivision Membership Requirements (pdf file) For attendance reporting methods, the NCAA allows schools to report either total tickets sold or the number of persons in attendance at the games. They require a minimum average of 15,000 people in attendance every other year. These numbers get posted to the NCAA statistics website for football each year. With the new rules starting in the 2006 season, the number of Bowl Subdivision schools could drop in the future if those schools are not able to pull in enough fans into the games. Additionally, 14 FCS schools had enough attendance to be moved up in 2012. Under current NCAA rules, these schools must have an invitation from an FBS conference in order to move to FBS. Three of them—Appalachian State, Georgia Southern, and Old Dominion—began FBS transitions in 2013. All had the required FBS conference invitations, with Old Dominion joining Conference USA in 2013, and Appalachian State and Georgia Southern set to join the Sun Belt Conference in 2014. The difference in the postseasons in each of the subdivisions grant the FCS an advantage to have the best record in college football history, 17-0, while the FBS only allows a 15-0 record.   Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, is the top level of college football. Schools in Division I FBS compete in post-season bowl games, with the champions of five conferences, along with the highest-ranked champion of the other five conferences, receiving automatic bids to the access bowls. FBS schools are limited to a total of 85 football players receiving financial assistance. For competitive reasons, a student receiving partial scholarship counts fully against the total of 85. Nearly all FBS schools that are not on NCAA probation give 85 full scholarships. As of 2014, there are 128 full members of Division I FBS. Four schools are in a transition period and will not be bowl eligible until the 2015 season: Any conference with at least 12 football teams may split its teams into two divisions and conduct a championship game between the division winners. The prize is normally a specific bowl game bid for which the conference has a tie-in. Some conferences have numbers in their names but this often has no relation to the number of member institutions in the conference. The Big Ten Conference did not formally adopt the "Big Ten" name until 1987, but unofficially used that name when it had 10 members from 1917 to 1946, and again from 1949 forward. However, it has continued to use the name even after it expanded to 11 members with the addition of Penn State in 1990, 12 with the addition of Nebraska in 2011, and 14 with the arrival of Maryland and Rutgers in 2014. The Big 12 Conference was established in 1996 with 12 members, but continues to use that name even after a number of departures and a few replacements left the conference with 10 members. On the other hand, the Pac-12 Conference has used names (official or unofficial) that have reflected the number of members since its current charter was established in 1959. The conference unofficially used "Big Five" (1959–62), "Big Six" (1962–64), and "Pacific-8" (1964–68) before officially adopting the "Pacific-8" name. The name duly changed to "Pacific-10" in 1978 with the addition of Arizona and Arizona State, and "Pac-12" (instead of "Pacific-12") in 2011 when Colorado and Utah joined. Conferences also tend to ignore their regional names when adding new schools. For example, the Pac-8/10/12 retained its "Pacific" moniker even though its four newest members (Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, Utah) are located in the inland West, and the original Big East kept its name even after adding schools (either in all sports or for football only) located in areas traditionally considered to be in the Midwest (Cincinnati, DePaul, Marquette, Notre Dame), Upper South (Louisville, Memphis) and Southwest (Houston, SMU). The non-football conference that assumed the Big East name when the original Big East split in 2013 is another example of this phenomenon, as half of its 10 inaugural schools (Butler, Creighton, DePaul, Marquette, Xavier) are traditionally regarded as being Midwestern. (** "Big Five" or "Power Five" conferences with guaranteed berths in the "access bowls" associated with the College Football Playoff)  The Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), formerly known as Division I-AA, determines its national champion on the field in a 24-team, single-elimination tournament. With the expansion of the tournament field in 2013 from 20 teams to 24, the champions of 11 conferences receive automatic bids, with 13 "at-large" spots; and the top 8 teams receive first-round byes. A team must have at least seven wins to be eligible for an at-large spot. The tournament traditionally begins on Thanksgiving weekend in late November, and during the era of the 16-team field ran for four weeks, ending with the championship game in mid-December. Since 2010, the tournament has run for four weeks (for seeds 9–24) to determine the two finalists, who play for the FCS national title in early January in Frisco, Texas, the scheduled host through the 2015 season. For thirteen seasons, the title game was played in Chattanooga, Tennessee, (1997–2009), preceded by five seasons in Huntington, West Virginia, where host Marshall advanced to the title game in four of the five years. When I-AA was formed in 1978, the playoffs included just four teams for its first three seasons, doubling to eight teams for one season in 1981. From 1982 to 1985, I-AA had a 12-team tournament, with each of the top four seeds receiving a first-round bye and a home game in the quarterfinals.http://www.fcspreview.com/history.html http://www.fcspreview.com/history.html The I-AA playoffs went to 16 teams in 1986, and the FCS playoffs expanded to 20 teams starting in 2010. After 28 seasons, the "I-AA" was dropped by the NCAA in 2006, although it is still informally and commonly used. The Football Championship Subdivision includes several conferences which do not participate in the eponymous post-season championship tournament. The Ivy League was reclassified to I-AA (FCS) following the 1981 seasonNew York Times – 2006-11-17 and plays a strict ten-game schedule. Although it qualifies for an automatic bid, the Ivy League has not played any postseason games at all since 1956, citing academic concerns. The Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) has its own championship game in mid-December between the champions of its East and West divisions. Also, three of its member schools traditionally do not finish their regular seasons until Thanksgiving weekend. Grambling State and Southern play each other in the Bayou Classic, and Alabama State plays Tuskegee University (a Division II team) in the Turkey Day Classic. SWAC teams are eligible to accept at-large bids if their schedule is not in conflict. The last SWAC team to participate in the I-AA playoffs was Jackson State in 1997; the SWAC never achieved success in the tournament, going winless in 19 games in twenty years (1978–97). From 2006 through 2009, the Pioneer Football League and Northeast Conference champions played in the Gridiron Classic, though all conference teams technically remained tournament eligible. If a league champion was invited to the national championship, the second-place team would play in the Gridiron Classic. That game was scrapped after the 2009 season when its four-year contract ran out; this coincided with the NCAA's announcement that the Northeast Conference would get an automatic bid to the tournament starting in 2010. The Big South Conference also received an automatic bid in the same season. The Pioneer Football League earned an automatic bid beginning in 2013. The Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) will abstain from the playoffs effective with the 2015 season. Schools in a transition period after joining the FCS from a lower division (or from the NAIA) are also ineligible for the playoffs. Division I FCS schools are currently restricted to giving financial assistance amounting to 63 full scholarships. As FCS football is an "equivalency" sport (as opposed to the "head-count" status of FBS football), Championship Subdivision schools may divide their allotment into partial scholarships. However, FCS schools may only have 85 players receiving any sort of athletic financial aid for football—the same numeric limit as FBS schools. Because of competitive forces, however, a substantial number of players in Championship Subdivision programs are on full scholarships. Another difference is that FCS schools are allowed to award financial aid to as many as 30 new players per season, as opposed to 25 in FBS. Finally, FCS schools are limited to 95 individuals participating in preseason practices, as opposed to 105 at FBS schools (the three service academies that play FBS football are exempt from preseason practice player limits by NCAA rule). A few Championship Subdivision conferences are composed of schools that offer no athletic scholarships at all, most notably the Ivy League and the Pioneer Football League (PFL), a football-only conference. The Ivy League allows no athletic scholarships at all, while the PFL consists of schools that offer scholarships in other sports but choose not to take on the expense of a scholarship football program. The Northeast Conference also sponsored non-scholarship football, but began offering a maximum of 30 full scholarship equivalents in 2006, which grew to 40 in 2011 after a later vote of the league's school presidents and athletic directors. The Patriot League only began awarding football scholarships in the 2013 season, with the first scholarships awarded only to incoming freshmen. Before the conference began its transition to scholarship football, athletes receiving scholarships in other sports were ineligible to play football for member schools. With the transition now complete for the upcoming 2016 season, member schools are allowed up to 60 full scholarship equivalents. Several Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision conferences have member institutions that do not compete in football. Such schools are sometimes unofficially referred to as I-AAA.[ ]  The following non-football conferences have full members that sponsor football: The following Division I conferences do not sponsor football. These conferences still compete in Division I for all sports that they sponsor.   Of these, the three that most recently sponsored football were the Atlantic 10, MAAC, and WAC. The A-10 football league dissolved in 2006 with its members going to the Colonial Athletic Association. In addition, four A-10 schools (Dayton, Fordham, Duquesne, and Massachusetts) play football in a conference other than the new CAA, which still includes two full-time A-10 members (Rhode Island and Richmond). The MAAC stopped sponsoring football in 2007, after most of its members gradually stopped fielding teams. The only pre-2007 MAAC member that still sponsors football is Marist; Monmouth became the second full MAAC member with football upon its arrival in 2013. Marist plays in the Pioneer Football League, while Monmouth spent the 2013 season as an FCS independent before moving its football program into the Big South. The WAC dropped football at the end of the 2012 season, after a near-complete membership turnover that saw the conference stripped of all but two of its football-sponsoring members. The two remaining football-sponsoring schools, Idaho and New Mexico State, played the 2013 season as FBS independents before becoming football-only members of the Sun Belt Conference in 2014. Some sports, most notably ice hockey and men's volleyball, have completely different conference structures that operate outside of the normal NCAA sports conference structure. As ice hockey is limited to a much smaller number of almost exclusively Northern schools, there is a completely different conference structure for teams. These conferences feature a mix of teams that play their other sports in various Division I conferences, and even Division II and Division III schools. For most of the early 21st century, there was no correlation between a team's ice hockey affiliation and its affiliation for other sports, with the exception of the Ivy League's hockey-playing schools all being members of the ECAC. For example, before 2013, the Hockey East men's conference consisted of one ACC school, one Big East school, four schools from the America East, one from the A-10, one CAA school, and two schools from the D-II Northeast Ten Conference, while the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) and Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) both had some Big Ten representation, plus Division II and III schools. Also, the divisional structure is truncated, with the Division II championship abolished in 1999. Starting with the 2013–14 season, Division I men's hockey experienced a major realignment. The Big Ten Conference became the first regular all-sport Division I conference to sponsor hockey since the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference ceased its sponsorship of the sport in 2003, with the remaining members forming Atlantic Hockey. Existing Big Ten schools withdrew their membership from the WCHA and CCHA. Additionally, six other schools from those conferences withdrew to form the new National Collegiate Hockey Conference at the same time. The fallout from these moves led to the demise of the CCHA, two more teams entering the NCHC, and further membership turnover in the men's side of the WCHA. Women's hockey was largely unaffected by this realignment. The Big Ten still has only four members with varsity women's hockey, with six teams required under conference bylaws for official sponsorship. As a result, the only changes in women's hockey affiliations in the 2010–13 period occurred in College Hockey America, which saw two schools drop the sport and three new members join. In the early 21st century, a controversy arose in the NCAA over whether schools will continue to be allowed to have one showcased program in Division I with the remainder of the athletic program in a lower division, as is the case of, notably, Johns Hopkins University lacrosse as well as Colorado College and University of Alabama in Huntsville in ice hockey. This is an especially important issue in hockey, which has no Division II national championship and has several schools whose other athletic programs compete in Division II and Division III. This controversy was resolved at the 2004 NCAA Convention in Nashville, Tennessee when the members supported Proposal 65-1, the amended legislation co-sponsored by Colorado College, Clarkson University, Hartwick College, the Johns Hopkins University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rutgers University-Newark, St. Lawrence University, and SUNY Oneonta. Each school affected by this debate is allowed to grant financial aid to student-athletes who compete in Division I programs in one men's sport and one women's sport. It is still permitted for other schools to place one men's and one women's sport in Division I going forward, but they cannot offer scholarships without bringing the whole program into compliance with Division I rules. In addition, schools in Divisions II and III are allowed to "play up" in any sport that does not have a championship for the school's own division, but only Division II programs and any Division III programs covered by the exemption can offer scholarships in those sports. The Division I programs at each of the eight "waiver schools" which were grandfathered with the passing of Proposal 65-1 were: Sport Men's Women's Baseball 11.7 – Basketball 13 15 Beach volleyball – 6.0 Bowling – 5.0 Cross-country/track & field 12.6 18.0 Equestrian – 15.0 Fencing 4.5 5.0 Field hockey – 12.0 Football 85 (FBS)63.0 (FCS) – Golf 4.5 6.0 Gymnastics 6.3 12 Ice hockey 18.0 18.0 Lacrosse 12.6 12.0 Rifle 3.6 – Rowing – 20.0 Rugby – 12.0 Skiing 6.3 7.0 Soccer 9.9 14.0 Softball – 12.0 Swimming and diving 9.9 14.0 Tennis 4.5 8 Triathlon – 4.5 Volleyball 4.5 12 Water polo 4.5 8.0 Wrestling 9.9 – Number Sport TeamsNCAA Sports Sponsorship and Participation Rates Report, October 2012, (page 192), http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/PR2013.pdf Conferences Scholarshipsper team Season 1 Football 252(128 FBS, 124 FCS) 23  (FBS)63.0 (FCS) Fall 2 Basketball 351 32 Winter 3 Baseball 298 31 Spring 4 Soccer 204 23 Fall 5 Ice Hockey 59 6 Winter 6 Lacrosse 68 10 Spring 7 Volleyball 22 4 Spring 8 Water Polo 22 4 Fall Number Sport TeamsNCAA Sports Sponsorship and Participation Rates Report, October 2012, (page 185), http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/PR2013.pdf Conferences Scholarshipsper team Season 1 Basketball 349 32 Winter 2 Soccer 327 32 Fall 3 Volleyball 332 32 * Fall 4 Softball 291 32 Spring 5 Rowing 88 12 Spring 6 Lacrosse 103 13 Spring 7 Field Hockey 79 11 Fall 8 Ice Hockey 36 4 Winter 9 Beach Volleyball 47 5 * Spring 10 Water Polo 34 6 Spring 11 Rugby† 12 -- Conference Nickname Founded Members Sports Headquarters American Athletic Conference The American 1979  11  21 Providence, Rhode Island Atlantic Coast Conference ** ACC 1953 15  26 Greensboro, North Carolina Big Ten Conference ** Big Ten, B1G 1896 14  28 Rosemont, Illinois Big 12 Conference ** Big 12 1996 10  21 Irving, Texas Conference USA C-USA 1995 14  19 Irving, Texas Division I FBS Independents 3 Mid-American Conference MAC 1946 12 23 Cleveland, Ohio Mountain West Conference MW 1999 11 19 Colorado Springs, Colorado Pac-12 Conference ** Pac-12 1915 12 22 Walnut Creek, California Southeastern Conference ** SEC 1932 14 20 Birmingham, Alabama Sun Belt Conference Sun Belt 1976 11 (12 in 2016) 18 New Orleans, Louisiana Conference Nickname Founded Full Members Sports Headquarters FCS Tournament Bid Big Sky Conference Big Sky 1963 12 16 Ogden, Utah Automatic Big South Conference Big South 1983 11 (10 in 2016) 18 Charlotte, North Carolina Automatic Colonial Athletic Association CAA 1983 10 21 Richmond, Virginia Automatic Division I FCS Independents 1 Ivy League Ivy League 1954 8 33 Princeton, New Jersey Automatic – (Abstains) Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference MEAC 1970 13 15 Norfolk, Virginia Abstains Missouri Valley Football Conference MVFC 1985 10 1 St. Louis, Missouri Automatic Northeast Conference NEC 1981 10  22 Somerset, New Jersey Automatic Ohio Valley Conference OVC 1948 12 17 Brentwood, Tennessee Automatic Patriot League Patriot 1986 10 23 Center Valley, Pennsylvania Automatic Pioneer Football League PFL 1991 11 1 St. Louis, Missouri Automatic Southern Conference SoCon 1921 10 20 Spartanburg, South Carolina Automatic Southland Conference SLC 1963 13 17 Frisco, Texas Automatic Southwestern Athletic Conference SWAC 1920 10  18 Birmingham, Alabama Abstains Conference Nickname Founded Members Sports Headquarters America East Conference America East 1979 9  18 Boston, Massachusetts Atlantic Sun Conference A-Sun 1978 8 19 Macon, Georgia Atlantic 10 Conference A-10 1975 14 21 Newport News, Virginia Big East Conference Big East 2013 10 22 New York City, New York Big West Conference Big West 1969 9 17 Irvine, California Horizon League Horizon 1979 10 19 Indianapolis, Indiana Independents Independents 0 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference MAAC 1980 11 23 Edison, New Jersey Missouri Valley Conference MVC / Valley 1907 10 19 St. Louis, Missouri The Summit League The Summit 1982 9 19 Elmhurst, Illinois West Coast Conference WCC 1952 10 15 San Bruno, California Western Athletic Conference WAC 1962 8  19 Greenwood Village, Colorado Conference Nickname Founded Members (Men/Women) Atlantic Hockey AHC 1997 11 (11/none) Big Ten Conference Big Ten 1896  6 (6/none) College Hockey America CHA 1999  6 (none/6) ECAC Hockey N/A 1962 12 (12/12) Hockey East N/A 1984 12 (12/9) Independents 2 (1/1)  National Collegiate Hockey Conference NCHC 2011 8 (8/none) Western Collegiate Hockey Association WCHA 1951 16 (10/8) "Head-count" sports, in which the NCAA limits the total number of individuals that can receive athletic scholarships, but allows each player to receive up to a full scholarship. "Equivalency" sports, in which the NCAA limits the total financial aid that a school can offer in a given sport to the equivalent of a set number of full scholarships. Roster limitations may or may not apply, depending on the sport. Anyone who participates in football is counted in that sport, even if he does not receive financial aid from the football program. An exception exists for players at non-scholarship FCS programs who receive aid in another sport. This exception refers to Bylaw 15.5.6.2.1 (pp. 203–04), which in essence describes non-scholarship FCS programs. Participants in basketball are counted in that sport, unless they also play football. Participants in men's ice hockey are counted in that sport, unless they also play football or basketball. Participants in both men's swimming and diving and men's water polo are counted in swimming and diving, unless they count in football or basketball. Participants in women's (indoor) volleyball are counted in that sport unless they also play basketball. All other multi-sport athletes are counted in whichever sport the school chooses. Football — D-I football programs are divided into FBS and FCS. The 128 FBS programs can award financial aid to as many as 85 players, with each player able to receive up to a full scholarship. The 124 FCS programs can award up to the equivalent of 63 full scholarships, divided among no more than 85 individuals. Some FCS conferences restrict scholarships to a lower level or prohibit scholarships altogether. Soccer — The Big 12 and the SEC are the only two major traditional D-I conferences that do not sponsor soccer. Several other D-I conferences also do not sponsor the sport—the Big Sky, MEAC, Mountain West, Ohio Valley, Southland, and SWAC. Ice Hockey — Almost all D-I ice hockey programs are in the Northeast, the Upper Midwest, or the Colorado Front Range. Only one D-I all-sports conference, the Big Ten, sponsors a men's hockey league. All other conferences operate as hockey-specific leagues. Of the 59 D-I hockey schools, 22 are otherwise classified as either D-II or D-III; D-II has an insufficient number of schools to sponsor a separate divisional championship, and the D-III schools were "grandfathered" in to D-I through their having sponsored hockey prior to the creation of D-III. Lacrosse — The vast majority of D-I lacrosse programs are from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. There are only two D-I programs west of the Mississippi, both on the Colorado Front Range (Air Force and Denver). Volleyball — None of the traditional D-I conferences sponsor men's volleyball. Two of the three major volleyball conferences are volleyball-specific conferences. In addition to the D-I schools, 25 D-II schools compete in D-I volleyball; 10 of these are members of Conference Carolinas, the only all-sports league outside Division III to sponsor the sport. Water Polo — The number of D-I schools sponsoring men's water polo has declined from 35 in 1987/88 to 22 in 2010/11.NCAA Sports Sponsorship and Participation Rates Report, October 2011, (page 184), http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/PR2012.pdf No school outside of California has ever made the finals of the championship, and all champions since 1998 have come from one of the four California based Pac-12 schools. As in the men's table above, sports are ranked in order of total possible scholarships. Numbers for head-count sports are indicated without a decimal point; those for equivalency sports are indicated with a decimal point, with a trailing zero if needed.
