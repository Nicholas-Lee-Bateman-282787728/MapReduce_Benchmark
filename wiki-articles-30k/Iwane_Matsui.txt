     was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army and the commander of the expeditionary force sent to China in 1937. He was convicted of war crimes and executed by the Allies for his involvement in the Nanking Massacre. Born in Nagoya, Matsui chose a military career and served in combat during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05). Due to his lifelong interest in China, he volunteered for an overseas assignment there shortly after graduating from the Army War College in 1906. As Matsui rose through the ranks, he earned a reputation as the Japanese Army's foremost expert on China, and he was an ardent advocate of pan-Asianism. He played a key role in founding the influential Greater Asia Association. Matsui retired from active duty in 1935 but was called back into service in August 1937 at the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War to lead the Japanese forces engaged in the Battle of Shanghai. After winning the battle Matsui succeeded in convincing Japan's high command to advance on the Chinese capital city of Nanking. The troops under his command who captured Nanking on December 13 were responsible for the notorious Nanking Massacre. Matsui finally retired from the army in 1938. Following Japan's defeat in World War II he was convicted of war crimes at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) and executed by hanging.  He and other convicted war criminals were enshrined at Yasukuni Shrine in 1978, an act that has stirred controversy. Iwane Matsui was born on July 27, 1878, in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture.Torsten Weber, "The Greater Asia Association and Matsui Iwane," in Pan-Asianism: A Documentary History, Volume 2, eds.

ISBN 9784121503374 He was the sixth son of Takekuni Matsui, who had been a samurai and a retainer to the daimyo of Owari during the Tokugawa shogunate. After completing elementary school, his parents insisted that he continue his education, but Matsui worried about his father's debts and did not want to burden him financially. Though he was a short, thin, quiet, and often sickly young man, Matsui opted for a career in the Army, because in Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.Takashi Hayasaka, 松井石根と南京事件の真実 (Tokyo: Bungei Shunjū, 2011), 24–27.

Matsui was an excellent student and graduated second in his class in November 1897.  His classmates included the future generals Jinzaburō Mazaki, Nobuyuki Abe, Shigeru Honjō, and Sadao Araki. In 1901 Matsui was admitted into the Army War College, an elite institution which accepted only about ten percent of annual applicants.Takashi Hayasaka, 松井石根と南京事件の真実 (Tokyo: Bungei Shunjū, 2011), 29–30.

He was immediately sent overseas where he served in combat in Manchuria as an officer in the 6th Regiment. During the Battle of Shoushanpu Matsui was wounded in action and most in his company were killed. After the war Matsui returned to his studies at the Army War College, and graduated at the top of his class in November 1906.

Due to his extensive experience in China Matsui became recognized as one of the most important of the Japanese Army's "China experts", and he was well known in the Army for his love of things Chinese and his hobby of writing Chinese poetry.Kazutoshi Hando et al., 歴代陸軍大将全覧: 昭和篇(1) (Tokyo: Chūō Kōron Shinsha, 2010), 132.

ISBN 9784166608171 As Chief of the Intelligence Division, Matsui was a strong supporter of Chiang Kai-shek, who was attempting to end the civil war in China and unify the country under his leadership. Matsui hoped that Chiang would succeed and form a strong partnership with Japan to resist both Western influence in Asia and communism. However, Matsui's tenure in office was punctuated by a series of crises. Against Matsui's advice the Japanese government sent troops to the Chinese city of Jinan in 1928 to protect Japanese property and civilians, but they ended up clashing with the Chinese Army. Matsui headed to Jinan to help settle the affair, but while he was still there Japanese army officers assassinated Zhang Zuolin, the warlord leader of Manchuria. Matsui, who had been a supporter of Zhang, immediately left for Manchuria to find out what had happened. He demanded that the officers responsible for the assassination be punished.Leonard Humphreys, The Way of the Heavenly Sword: The Japanese Army in the 1920s (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1995), 148, 215–216.

At first Matsui condemned the invasion as the work of renegade army officers, but he was equally stung by what he believed were unfair denunciations of Japan itself by Chinese delegates to the League of Nations. Matsui suspected that the Western powers and the League of Nations were deliberately attempting to provoke conflict between Japan and China. Matsui believed that the solution to this problem was for the nations of Asia to create their own "Asian League", which would "extend to the 400 million people of China the same help and deep sympathy that we have given Manchuria".Torsten Weber, "The Greater Asia Association and Matsui Iwane," in Pan-Asianism: A Documentary History, Volume 2, eds.

While in Taiwan, he took the opportunity to set up a branch of the Greater Asia Association, which declared Matsui its "honorary advisor". He then returned to Japan in August 1934 to take a seat on Japan's Supreme War Council. Meanwhile, Sino-Japanese relations continued to deteriorate and Matsui too was gradually souring toward the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, the same government he had strongly promoted back when serving as Chief of the Intelligence Division.Takashi Hayasaka, 松井石根と南京事件の真実 (Tokyo: Bungei Shunjū, 2011), 64–66. ISBN 9784166608171 In the first issue of the Greater Asia Association's official bulletin, put out in 1933, Matsui denounced China's leaders for having "sold out their own country of China and betrayed Asia" due to their allegedly pro-Western attitudes. Over time he gravitated toward a group within the Army General Staff led by General Tetsuzan Nagata, which was advocating that Japan overthrow Chiang Kai-shek using military force. Matsui's career came to an abrupt end in August 1935 when Nagata, a member of the so-called "Control Faction", was assassinated by a member of the rival Imperial Way Faction."永久保存版 - 三派合同 大アンケート," Shokun!, February 2001, 178. By this point Matsui was fed up with the ruthless factional infighting that had divided the Japanese Army, and so he decided that he would take responsibility for the scandal and resign from active duty in the Army.Masataka Matsuura, 「大東亜戦争」はなぜ起きたのか (Nagoya: Nagoya Daigaku Shuppankai, 2010), 375–383.

Matsui came out of the meeting believing that joint anti-communism could be the basis for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. Then in December 1936, following the Xi'an Incident, Chiang agreed to join with the Communist Party of China to resist Japan, a move that Matsui viewed as a personal betrayal.Takashi Hayasaka, 松井石根と南京事件の真実 (Tokyo: Bungei Shunjū, 2011), 78.

The war was initially limited to northern China, but in August the fighting spread to Shanghai. The Japanese government decided to send two divisions of reinforcements to drive the Chinese Army from Shanghai, which would be organized as the Shanghai Expeditionary Army (SEA). Due to a shortage of active duty generals, the Army General Staff opted to pull someone from the reserves to lead the new army and on August 15 Matsui was officially appointed commander of the SEA.Tokushi Kasahara, 南京事件 (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1997), 50–53.

ISBN 4004305306 However, Matsui had made it clear to his superiors even before he had left Japan in August that he was determined to capture the capital city of China, Nanking, which lay 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Matsui forcefully asserted that the war with China would not end until Nanking was in their control, and he envisaged that the fall of Nanking would result in the total collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's government. After Chiang's fall Matsui hoped to play a role in forming a new government in China which, according to his own conception, would be a democracy that would better serve the interests of both Japan and the people of China.Toshiyuki Hayase, 将軍の真実 : 松井石根人物伝 (Tokyo: Kōjinsha, 1999), 195–196. ISBN 4769809301 However, the historian Tokushi Kasahara also sees personal motives behind Matsui's insistence on capturing Nanking. Kasahara suspects that Matsui, as an aging general with a relatively undistinguished military record, desperately wanted to crown his career with one last battlefield victory like the capture of the Chinese capital. Ultimately though, it was Heisuke Yanagawa's 10th Army which, on November 19, abruptly crossed the operation restriction line and began advancing on Nanking. In response to this flagrant act of insubordination, Matsui did make some effort to restrain Yanagawa, but Matsui also insisted to the high command that marching on Nanking was the right course of action.Takashi Hayasaka, 松井石根と南京事件の真実 (Tokyo: Bungei Shunjū, 2011), 121–130.

ISBN 9780804762069 Most of the buildings and civilian homes outside Nanking had been burned down by the Chinese Army to deprive the Japanese of shelter, so Matsui's subordinate commanders decided on their own that they had no choice but to station all their men within the city itself. Nevertheless, Matsui's instructions said nothing about treatment of Chinese POWs. Matsui would inadvertently contribute to the atrocity in a major way when he demanded on December 14 that his triumphal entrance into Nanking be scheduled for the early date of December 17. At the time his subordinates in Nanking objected because they were still in the process of scrambling to apprehend all the former Chinese soldiers hiding in the city and had no facilities in which to hold them. Regardless, Matsui held firm, and in many cases his men responded to the conundrum by ordering that all their prisoners be executed immediately after capture. Most of the large-scale massacres that took place within Nanking occurred in the days immediately prior to Matsui's entrance into the city.Masahiro Yamamoto, Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), 92, 138–142.

ISBN 9784121503374 Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui solely because of the Nanking Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his comment that he did not recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was the reason he was being removed.Toshiyuki Hayase, 将軍の真実 : 松井石根人物伝 (Tokyo: Kōjinsha, 1999), 181.

Although the Greater Asia Association was reorganized several times between 1942 and 1945, at no point did Matsui ever cease to serve as either the President or Vice President of the organization.

ISBN 4769809301 The prosecution charged Matsui with Class A war crimes or "crimes against peace", alleging that he had participated in a conspiracy to wage aggressive war against other countries, and also with Class B/C war crimes or "conventional war crimes", alleging that he was responsible for the Nanking Massacre of 1937 to 1938.Minoru Kitamura, The Politics of Nanjing: An Impartial Investigation (Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 2007), 63. ISBN 9780761835790The IMTFE did not readily distinguish between Class B and Class C war crimes, which were generally grouped together. Matsui had told friends before going to Sugamo Prison that at the IMTFE he planned to defend not only himself but also Japan's wartime conduct as a whole. Matsui insisted that Japan had acted defensively against aggression by foreign powers and that Japan's war aims were to liberate Asia from Western imperialism.Toshiyuki Hayase, 将軍の真実 : 松井石根人物伝 (Tokyo: Kōjinsha, 1999), 253, 266–267. ISBN 4769809301 Concerning the origins of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Matsui called it "a fight between brothers within the 'Asian family'" and stated that the war was fought against the Chinese, not "because we hate them, but on the contrary because we love them too much. It is just the same in a family when an elder brother has taken all that he can stand from his ill-behaved younger brother and has to chastise him in order to make him behave properly." On the matter of the Nanking Massacre, Matsui admitted that he was aware of a few isolated crimes committed by individual soldiers, including acts of rape, looting, and murder, but he adamantly denied that any large-scale massacres had occurred in the city.Toshiyuki Hayase, 将軍の真実 : 松井石根人物伝 (Tokyo: Kōjinsha, 1999), 280–282. ISBN 4769809301 Still, Matsui admitted to the IMTFE that he bore "moral responsibility" for the wrongdoing of his men. He denied that he bore "legal responsibility" because, he claimed, it was the military police of each division who were in charge of prosecuting individual criminal acts, not the army commander. However, Matsui also testified that he had urged that any offenders be sternly punished, a statement which, the prosecution quickly noted, implied that he did have some level of legal responsibility.Kei Ushimura, Beyond the "Judgment of Civilization": The Intellectual Legacy of the Japanese War Crimes Trials (Tokyo: International House of Japan, 2003), 41–45, 49, 56. OCLC 52300525 Ultimately the IMTFE dismissed most of the accusations laid against Matsui.

ISBN 9781845451806 The judges rejected Matsui's membership in the Greater Asia Association as being evidence that he was involved in the "conspiracy" to wage wars of aggression.Masataka Matsuura, 「大東亜戦争」はなぜ起きたのか (Nagoya: Nagoya Daigaku Shuppankai, 2010), 510–511, 513. ISBN 9784815806293 Nonetheless, for his role in the Nanking Massacre, he was convicted and sentenced to death under Count 55, charging defendants with having "deliberately and recklessly disregarded their legal duty to take adequate steps to secure the observance and prevent breaches" of the laws of war.Masahiro Yamamoto, Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), 200, 220–223. ISBN 0313000964 The IMTFE delivered the following verdict on November 12, 1948."Tojo Condemned by Court to Hang," New York Times, November 12, 1948, 1. The Tribunal is satisfied that Matsui knew what was happening. He did nothing, or nothing effective to abate these horrors. He did issue orders before the capture of the city enjoining propriety of conduct upon his troops and later he issued further orders to the same purport. These orders were of no effect as is now known, and as he must have known... He was in command of the Army responsible for these happenings. He knew of them. He had the power, as he had the duty, to control his troops and to protect the unfortunate citizens of Nanking. He must be held criminally responsible for his failure to discharge this duty.Yuma Totani, The Tokyo War Crimes Trial: The Pursuit of Justice in the Wake of World War II (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Asia Center, 2008), 135. ISBN 9780674028708 Historian Yuma Totani notes that this verdict represents "one of the earliest precedents for command responsibility in the history of international law." Shortly after hearing the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his feelings about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said, The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace&nbsp;... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief&nbsp;... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me&nbsp;... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, in the sense that it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time. On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948."The Official Report of the Japanese Executions," New York Times, December 23, 1948, 6."Banzais Are Shouted by Tojo On His Way to the Gallows," Washington Post, December 24, 1948, 2. Soon after Matsui was executed, he was cremated and the US Army took away his ashes to prevent a memorial from being created. However, unbeknownst to them, some of the ashes had been hidden by the owner of the crematorium. He later brought these ashes to the shrine Matsui had founded, the Koa Kannon, and they remain there to this day."Ａ級戦犯、遺灰眠る観音," Asahi Shimbun, August 27, 2009, 14. In 1978 all seven war criminals executed by the IMTFE, including Iwane Matsui, were officially enshrined in Yasukuni Shrine in a secret ceremony conducted by head priest Nagayoshi Matsudaira. This event did not become publicly known until the following year. In Japan the majority of the historical literature on Iwane Matsui's life focuses on his role in the Nanking Massacre. He has both sympathizers, who depict him as "the tragic general" who was unjustly executed, and detractors, who assert that he had the blood of a massacre on his hands. Among his detractors are the historian Yutaka Yoshida, who believes that Matsui made six serious mistakes which contributed to the massacre. First, he insisted on advancing on Nanking without ensuring proper logistical support which forced his men to rely on plunder. Second, he established no policies to protect the safety of Chinese POWs. Third, he permitted an excessively large number of soldiers to enter the city of Nanking. Fourth, he did not cooperate sufficiently with the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone. Fifth, he insisted that his triumphal entrance into Nanking be held at an early date, a demand which his subordinate commanders responded to by increasing the speed and severity of their operations. Finally, he spent too much time on political maneuvering and neglected his duties as commander."永久保存版 - 三派合同 大アンケート," Shokun!, February 2001, 202. The historian Keiichi Eguchi and the researcher Toshio Tanabe likewise find that Matsui bears responsibility for urging the government to march on Nanking, which led directly to the massacre. Tanabe concurs with Yoshida that Matsui should have put in place policies to protect Chinese POWs and should not have ordered a premature triumphal entrance into the city of Nanking."永久保存版 - 三派合同 大アンケート," Shokun!, February 2001, 190, 194. Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto have argued that the death sentence was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death.Richard Minear, Victors' Justice: The Tokyo War Crimes Trial (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1971), 210. OCLC 235625 The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those who were involved in the Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity."永久保存版 - 三派合同 大アンケート," Shokun!, February 2001, 198. Matsui has a somewhat infamous reputation in China today. The popular nonfiction author Takashi Hayasaka asserts that he often heard Matsui referred to as "the Hitler of Japan" by Chinese citizens during his travels in the city of Nanking because of Matsui's connection to the Nanking Massacre.Takashi Hayasaka, 松井石根と南京事件の真実 (Tokyo: Bungei Shunjū, 2011), 20. ISBN 9784166608171 However, Matsui's name was not always notorious in China for this reason. In 1945 the Communist Party of China denounced Matsui as a war criminal because of his propaganda work for an ultranationalist group, rather than for the Nanking Massacre.Takashi Yoshida, The Making of the "Rape of Nanking" (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 66. ISBN 0195180968 Historian Masataka Matsuura notes that the focus within current scholarship on Matsui's role in the Nanking Massacre has distracted from the fact that his pan-Asianism was the defining characteristic of his life.
