 Gap (; ) is a commune in southeastern France, the capital and largest town of the Hautes-Alpes department. At 750 m above sea level, it is France's highest prefecture (departmental capital). Together with other Alpine towns, Gap engages in the Alpine Town of the Year Association for the implementation of the Alpine Convention to achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc. Gap was awarded Alpine Town of the Year in 2002.  An Alpine crossroads at the intersection of D994 and the Route nationale 85, or Route Napoléon, which crosses the Col Bayard north of the city, Gap is located between the historic Dauphiné and the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur administrative region. With its 40,761 inhabitants (2012), it is the main town of an urban area of 62,072 inhabitants (2011), which is the main town of the .  above sea level, at the right bank of the , close to where it joins the Durance River to the north, Gap is in the midst of a rich and preserved natural environment, south-west of the Écrins National Park, south-east of the  and west of the Lac de Serre-Ponçon. The region around Gap is known as . The commune of Gap is almost entirely located in the Sillon de Gap [Gap trench], a wide valley bottom located about  above sea level and including the western slopes almost  (Charance mountain and pic de Gleize). The highest point of the municipality is however outside this great valley, on another watershed slope, the Raz de Bec, at , is within the limits of the commune, and was in the former commune of Chaudun, which merged with Gap in the 19th century. This valley was shaped by the Glacier de la Durance during the last ice age, known as the Würm glaciation. Thus, soils are very often formed by moraine deposits. No less than five levels of lateral and frontal moraines are observable.Carte géologique de la France au 1/80 000. (Geologic Map of France 1/80,000) Feuilles de Gap, no 200, 3e édition. Ministère de l'Industrie. These are clearly visible, especially on the southern slopes of the Col Bayard, where they were formed in places of the terraces used by agriculture. In retreating, the glacier also left erratics of several metres high. Examples include, among others, the erratic boulders of Peyre-Ossel and Justice. The glacier, which in the Quaternary has shaped the Sillon de Gap, presented several : one to the glacier of the Drac from the cols of Manse and Bayard and one towards the Buëch Valley by the La Freissinouse border.Claude EYZENQ, Hautes-Alpes, Ubaye, Haut-Drac, Préalpes drômoises The cover of morainic debris is omnipresent in the Sillon de Gap but is not the only vestige of the Quaternary glaciation. There is also the typical topography of glacial valleys. The location of the town of Gap corresponds to an , where large quantities of clay were deposited. Upstream lies the  [glacial lock] of Pont-Sarrazin and downstream of Tourronde.Pierre Chauvet et Paul Pons, Les Hautes-Alpes, hier, aujourd'hui, demain, p. 863 The mechanical action of the glacier de la Durance was facilitated by the presence of relatively friable layers. The part which is central and south-east of the town consists mainly of soft rocks (Callovo-Oxfordian black marl). They consist of soft schist of bluish or brown colors.Notice explicative de la Carte géologique de la France au 1/80 000. (Geological Map of France at 1/80,000) Feuilles de Gap, no 200, 3e édition.

During its passage through the commune, the Luye receives several torrents. It merges on the right bank with the  long Buzon, the Bonne () and the torrent du Cristaye (); and on the left bank, the La Magdeleine Canal (), the Riotord () and the torrent du Partiment, () long. Even if the Luye hydrographic basin represents the largest share of the commune, waters at the southwest of the commune (the Saint-Jean quarter) drain into the torrent of Malecombe, a tributary of the Rousine, which flows into the Durance south of Tallard. In the northwest of the commune (located on the other side of the col de Gleize) lie the  sources. Around  above sea level, they are formed by several streams which converge at the old village of . Finally, an important channel feeds Gap with drinking water and water for irrigation: The , or Canal du Drac, about  long, leads the water captured in the Drac via a tunnel under the Col de Manse to the Jaussauds reservoir (altitude ) where it divides into two branches, including the main branch which bypasses Gap west to Correo through Charance. packed caption="Waters around Gap" alt=The Luye at Gap, near to the Parc de la Pépinière|The Luye at Gap, near to the Parc de la Pépinière alt=The lake of the Jaussauds reservoir|The lake of the Jaussauds Reservoir Its temperate climate is influenced by a Mediterranean climate (hot and dry summers) and also an Alpine climate (cold winters). Thus the main feature of the local climate is the importance of the sunshine enjoyed by the city. Furthermore, snowfall underscores the mountain character of the city. Thunderstorms are frequent in summer, fog is rather rare. The tables below represent averages of monthly temperatures. They also show the maximum and minimum mean temperatures over the period 1951-1970. Comparisons with surveys of the period 1878-1940 showed lower maximum averages over the period 1950-1970 for the winter and summer months. Over the same period, again for the winter and summer months, there was an increase in the average minimum. Thus the evolution of the climate tends towards a slight reduction of differences in winter temperatures on the one hand, and summer on the other. Extreme temperatures also highlight the mountain and Mediterranean components of the climate. Indeed, over the decade 1951-1960 the absolute minimum recorded was  on 3 February 1956. While the absolute maximum was of  observed July 8, 1952. Below is the average monthly rainfall. The evolution of the average monthly temperatures (in red) and an average monthly rainfall (in blue) are summarized in the chart below.    Outside of the valley breezes, the prevailing wind is from the north, locally named the bise wind. In fact, it is a component of the mistral. Up the Drac Valley, this wind crosses the Bayard plateau down to Gap. When it carries clouds, there is the phenomenon of "the bar of Bayard": a compact pile of clouds covering the Bayard plateau. Pushed by the wind, they descend into the valley. Under the effect of the increase in pressure and temperature, these clouds disappear immediately a few hundred metres further down. Even in perpetual motion, cloud cover appears motionless. If these conditions are synonymous with freshness in autumn and spring, and bright cold in the winter, they are always accompanied by a perfectly sunny and clear atmosphere above the city. The town of Gap lies at a crossroads. The route nationale  heads towards the north and the south, the  to the east and the departmental RD 994 road to the west. The RN 85 travels  north to Grenoble. Sisteron is located  in the opposite direction, and eventually also to the Mediterranean. The RN 94 travels  to reach Briançon and towards Italy via the Col de Montgenèvre. Meanwhile, the RD 994 joins with Pont-Saint-Esprit in Gard, more than  distant.  separates Gap from La Saulce on the  motorway. This highway provides fast travel to Aix-en-Provence and Marseille  away, via the Durance Valley. A planned extension of this highway to the north, to the  seems definitively buried. Although it has been desired by elected officials for the voters and the State, in order to divert trucks from the A7, the absence of this highway has not created the announced decline. On the contrary, the city ceased to grow (see demographics) without being absorbed by its relatively distant neighbours thanks precisely to its relative isolation from the main road network, including Grenoble (in no effect a dormitory community). Taking into account the increase in road traffic, the creation of an urban boulevard became a prospect of improvement. This one  long and comprising several structures, could bypass the city from the west. Concerning also the transit of traffic serving the city itself, it would act as a bypass, leaving the RN 85, close to the area of Micropolis to the southwest and lead to the RN 94, north-east towards the Romette intersection.  The city is served by SNCF. Gap is connected directly to Paris daily by a sleeper train (the sleeping car was removed in 2007) network Intercités at night, but also by Corail or TER in Briançon, Grenoble, Valence (Gare de Valence-Ville and Gare de Valence TGV), as well as in Aix-en-Provence and Marseille. In the 1930s, work aimed at the establishment of a metric line between Gap and Corps by the Col de Manse was undertaken. These were never finished and the  was never born. Portions were reused for the basis of the route nationale. The  was also begun in the east, but never completed. A double curve viaduct remains beneath the waters of the Lac de Serre-Ponçon. Located  from Gap, the Gap–Tallard Airport may receive passenger traffic. The company Air Alpes operated a DHC-6 Twin otter, with a regular service between Paris-Le Bourget and Gap from 1973 to 1977, since abandoned. The vast majority of air movements are sports-oriented. Public transport in the city is provided by the Linea network. In 2008, nine lines made up this network. There is also a school transport service, a shuttle between /Centre-ville/Gap-Bayard runs in July and August, a shuttle to the hyper-Centre and a taxibus is available on demand. Aside from the taxibus, all of these are totally free services for users. Several cycle paths traverse the city. Some are installed on their own, solely as cycleways, others are cycle lanes alongside roads. Of the 21,479 houses in Gap in 2011, 88% were principal residences (against 89.20% of 19,043 houses in 2006), and 8.50% were vacant (compared with 7% of the 19,043 in 2006). Two thirds of them are apartments (almost 65%). A majority of these houses consist of 4 rooms (30%) or 5 rooms (28%). Overall, the buildings date from the period between 1946-1990 (65%). Half of the inhabitants of principal residences are owners (51%), the share of social rental housing (HLM) represents only 15%.  The first attestation of the name of the city is located in the ancient texts as Vappincum, later reduced to Vappum, the form of Gap is found in the 13th century. The toponym Vappincum is analyzed on the basis of a radical Vapp- unknown meaning, and the suffix -incu of Ligurian origin found in Provence and the Massif central to the Alps (cf. Arlanc, Nonenque, Moirans and Morencum in the 10th century and Lemenc, a district of Chambéry, formerly Lemencum). The Gap form actually began as the short form Vappum, well attested, by the final drop. The v- has been radically treated as a w- Germanic,A. Dauzat and Ch.

This phonetic evolution would be more specifically made under the influence of the Gothic language.A. Farnaud, Étymologie du nom de Gap Bulletin de la Société d'études des Hautes-Alpes, année 1905, pages 431 à 434. The name in Provençal (Alpine) is also Gap. The first settlement of Gap dates back to the Neolithic.Société d'études des Hautes-Alpes, Histoire de la ville de Gap, p. 4. The culture of these first inhabitants belonged to the southern Chasséen.Bernard Bligny, Histoire du Dauphiné, p. 28. Very rare testimonies of the pre-Roman era are formed by the remains of an oppidum located at the summit of the hill of Saint-Mens with few visible traces of a dolmen uncovered in 1866Colette Jourdain-Annequin, Atlas culturel des Alpes occidentales. De la préhistoire à la fin du Moyen Âge, p. 78. and an ancient cemetery in the hamlet of Pré Camargue; but no remains were kept of these last two findings.Joseph Roman, L'Époque préhistorique et gauloise dans le département des Hautes-Alpes, pages 16 à 18. Gallic money was also found. Gap was the capital of the Celto-Ligurian  tribe.Histoire du passage des Alpes par Annibal, p. 212, Jean-André de Luc These peoples, probably belonging to the Caturiges tribe, spoke the Celtic language.Société d'études des Hautes-Alpes, Histoire de la ville de Gap, p. 5.  The  was then part of the territory of the Vocontii, a Gallic people who were Romanised during the conquest of Gallia Narbonensis in 125-124 BC, whose capitals were Luc-en-Diois and Vaison. Around 20 BC, Cottius, a leader of tribes of the Valley of Suze, allied to Rome, and urged by Augustus, undertook the building of a route of communication in the Valley of the Durance. He had to submit the various peoples concerned, who were eager to maintain their independence. This route, built between 14 and 6 BC, and which received the name of Via Cottia per Alpem, linked Turin to Sisteron and consisted of six stations. Then known as Vapincum, the town of Gap was founded from one of these stations. In 22 AD, Gap became the start of a Roman road to Valence.Société d'études des Hautes-Alpes, Histoire de la ville de Gap, pages 7 à 9. At this time, the location of the future city was a Roman camp. The camp was protected by a terraced wall surrounded by a ditch.Georges de Manteyer, Le nom et les deux premières enceintes de Gap, p. 146. It was the largest between Montgenèvre and Sisteron. The garrison that occupied it could be estimated at 360 men. They came from the surrounding peoples. They were assigned to protect users of the Roman roads against looters. Later, an axis towards the  was created. The Gap site took importance by becoming a hub of communications. The economy was mainly pastoral and the first crops grew on the slopes of Puymaure. Some houses were built on stilts as shown by excavations. During the first centuries, the population increased significantly. Towards the end of the 3rd century and 4th century, a new fortification was built. These ramparts,Georges de Manteyer, Le nom et les deux premières enceintes de Gap, schémas et plans en fin d'ouvrage. which completely surrounded the first enclosure, were composed of eleven ratings and eleven towers that protected the inhabitants of the city from barbarian invasions.Société d'études des Hautes-Alpes, Histoire de la ville de Gap, p. 11. With an enclosed area of , Gap made a big village. From 28 December 986, the Bishop of Gap had sovereignty over the city due to concerns about future Muslim invasions, and held that power until Revolutionary reforms in 1801 despite Gap being annexed by the French crown in 1512. Gap and its area became part of the , established at the end of the 10th century, and then by the County of Forcalquier, which separated in the 12th century. The Bishops of Gap were also the temporal lords of the city. But their control was long disputed by officers of the Counts of Forcalquier, notably under the episcopate of Arnoux, who later became the bishop of the city. On the death of the last Count of Forcalquier in 1209, the Embrun and Gap areas were passed to the Dauphiné while those of Forcalquier and Sisteron returned to the County of Provence. It is for this reason that the current coat of arms of the Region Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur is the coat of arms of the Dauphiné. In 1349 the Dauphin of Viennois Humbert II passed on his Principality to the eldest son of Philippe VI of France, the future King of France Charles V. From 1349 to 1457 Dauphiné remained a Principality separated from France, whose prince was the eldest son of the King of France. In 1457, Charles VII put an end to this status and joined the province to the Kingdom of France. The Knights Templar owned a house at Gap, a secondary establishment which depended on a . The creation of the , which ruled the city, dated back to before 1209. In the 14th century, the city took advantage of the benefits of the installation of the Popes in Avignon, which brought a more frequent passage of travellers to develop a craft of wool and skins, which made it thrive. Avignon linkages were strengthened by the presence of many clerics of the entourage of the Pope, within the chapter of the canons of Gap.  The 16th and 17th centuries were particularly dark times for the city. The Wars of Religion were lethal in the region. Gap was a Catholic stronghold, while the  switched to Protestantism. After various skirmishes, François de Bonne, leader of the Protestants, decided to attack Gap, nevertheless protected by 20 towers. On the night of 3 January 1577, François Philibert, known as Cadet de Charance, opened the Saint-Arey gate, and allowed him to attack the city by surprise. To cries of "Kill! Kill!" his men proceeded in veritable butchery. De Bonne burned the cathedral, plundered the monasteries, appropriated the property of the inhabitants, and built a proud citadel on the Colline de Puymaure [Puymaure Hill] where it dominated over Gap.id., p. 54 Returned to Catholicism in 1622, he abandoned all claims to the city. In 1692, the troops of the  ruler Victor Amadeus II, committed with the League of Augsburg, against the France of Louis XIV, captured the city, abandoned by its inhabitants, on 29 August. Gap was looted and burned, of the 953 houses in the commune, 798 were destroyed.  In 1790, during the French Revolution, the province of Dauphiné was divided into three departments: Drôme, Isère and Hautes-Alpes which Gap became the prefecture. Hautes-Alpes then became the highest Department of France and Gap, the highest prefecture of the country. It remains prefecture of Haute-Alpes to this day. In 1802, the baron  was appointed . Under his administration, the city of Gap and the Department of the Hautes-Alpes experienced some growth. It built roads linking Gap to Italy and the Drôme Valley and created a departmental nursery. His statue, carved by the Gap sculptor Jean Marcellin, was erected in 1866 at the square which bears his name.  Napoleon I left Elba in February 1815 and stopped at Gap on 5 March 1815 with 40 horsemen and 10 grenadiers, where he had thousands of copies of his Proclamations printed. The whole population of the city accompanied Napoleon when he left Gap. Acknowledging the reception of the population of these regions, he left the Haut-Alpins with the following message:  Gap experienced a new era from 1875 with the arrival of the railway. The commune of Chaudun was joined with Gap, by the prefectoral Decree of 22 October 1895.Jean-Pierre Bardet et Claude Motte, Paroisses et communes de France; Hautes-Alpes, p. 144. During World War II, the city was part of the free zone. But after November 1942 and the Case Anton, it was integrated into the occupied area. After Operation Overlord on 6 June 1944, the Germans placed some 1,000 men to hold the cuvette de Gap [Gap Basin], a key point of the Cannes-Lyon axis. , 37 years old, an original Gaullist resistant and accomplished soldier (he had trained more than 4000 resistance fighters in combat and about a hundred in sabotage) was sent by the GPRF of General de Gaulle to liberate the city on behalf of the Resistance. Aided by local guerrillas and resistance, he has however no way to take the city by force. He then started with his men in a campaign of sabotage and bombings that lasted more than a month. After having isolated the city by destroying the infrastructure surrounding it (overpasses, railway lines, bridges, etc.), the FFI had managed to rally the population and give the occupiers an impression of encirclement. A mid-August 1944, Drouot-L'Hermine, who lost his right-hand man, , a few days earlier, sent two emissaries to negotiate the surrender of the Germans. The Germans were convinced of facing a large-scale uprising, and agreed to lay down their weapons provided that it was to regular troops (they refused, therefore, to surrender to the Resistance). While the Americans were more than  away, time was pressing for Drouot-L'Hermine. Indeed, he received an order from De Gaulle to liberate the city before the arrival of the Allies, to support the position of France as a victorious nation, liberated through the active participation of the Resistance. Drouot-L'Ermine then developed a new ploy. He managed to convince the Allies to advance one of their tanks into enemy terrain, and shoot a few rounds close to Gap. Shots echoed in the valley, and the Germans immediately identified the characteristic sound of a tank, a weapon that the guerrillas did not hold. Thinking they were then dealing with the Allies, the troops of the Reich surrendered to the Resistance. Therefore, a few hundred resistance fighters were able to capture 1,200 German soldiers, including 40 officers. The city was liberated on the evening of 19 August 1944."Histoires Interdites: La Face cachée de la Libération" - documentaire raconté par Pierre Lescure, avec la collaboration de l'historien Olivier Wieviorka The commune of Romette was associated with that of Gap, by decree dated 25 November 1974.Jean-Pierre Bardet et Claude Motte, Paroisses et communes de France; Hautes-Alpes, p. 145. packed caption="Aerial photographs of Gap from the 20th century" An aerial photograph of Gap (IGN) from 1927 An aerial photograph of Gap (IGN) from 1945 An aerial photograph of Gap (IGN) from 1965 An aerial photograph of Gap (IGN) from 1978 An aerial photograph of Gap (IGN) from 1995 Gap ran a bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, but lost out as France's candidate to nearby Annecy.

Until the departmental elections of March 2015, Gap was divided into six cantons: Gap-Campagne (including five communes: La Freissinouse, Manteyer, Pelleautier, Rabou and La Roche-des-Arnauds), Gap-Centre, Gap-Nord-Est, Gap-Nord-Ouest, Gap-Sud-Est and Gap-Sud-Ouest.

Gap is twinned with a couple of European cities. It is in this framework that socio-cultural, educational and sports exchanges are made. In addition, decentralised cooperation agreements have been signed with a couple of cities in Africa and Asia. In 2012, the commune had 40,761 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses carried out in the town since 1793. From the 21st century, a census for communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants takes place every year as a result of a sample survey, unlike the other communes which have a real census every five years.At the beginning of the 21st century, the terms of census have been amended by Act No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002, known as the 'law of democracy of proximity' relating to local democracy, and in particular title V "census operations", in order to allow, after a transitional period running from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For communes with a population of over 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is carried out each year, all of the territory of these communes is taken into account at the end of the same period of five years. The first legal population later than 1999 and within this new system came into force on 1 January 1, 2009 and corresponds to the Census of 2006.In the table of censuses, by convention in Wikipedia, the principle has been retained for legal populations after 1999 to display in the table of censuses that populations corresponding to the year 2006, first published legal population calculated in accordance with the concepts defined in Decree No. 2003-485 of 5 June 2003, and the years corresponding to an exhaustive census investigation of communes under 10,000 inhabitants, and in the years 2006, 2011, 2016, etc. for the communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants, as well as the last legal population published by Insee for the Communes as a whole.  The population of the commune is relatively old. The rate of people over 60 years of age (24.8%) is higher than the national rate (21.6%) while being lower than the departmental rate (25%). Like national and departmental allocations, the female population of the commune is greater than the male population. The rate (52.2%) is of a similar order of magnitude as the national rate (51.6%).
