  In mathematics, a Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two.  That is, it is a prime number that can be written in the form  for some integer .  They are named after Marin Mersenne, a French Minim friar, who studied them in the early 17th century. The first four Mersenne primes  are 3, 7, 31, and 127. If  is a composite number then so is . ( is divisible by both  and .) The definition is therefore unchanged when written  where  is assumed prime. More generally, numbers of the form  without the primality requirement are called Mersenne numbers.  Mersenne numbers are sometimes defined to have the additional requirement that  be prime, equivalently that they be pernicious Mersenne numbers, namely those pernicious numbers whose binary representation contains no zeros.  The smallest composite pernicious Mersenne number is . Mersenne primes  are also noteworthy due to their connection to perfect numbers. , 49 Mersenne primes are known. The largest known prime number  is a Mersenne prime. Since 1997, all newly found Mersenne primes have been discovered by the “Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search” (GIMPS), a distributed computing project on the Internet. Many fundamental questions about Mersenne primes remain unresolved. It is not even known whether the set of Mersenne primes is finite or infinite. The Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and predicts their order of growth. It is also not known whether infinitely many Mersenne numbers with prime exponents are composite, although this would follow from widely believed conjectures about prime numbers, for example, the infinitude of Sophie Germain primes congruent to 3 (mod 4), for these primes ,  (which is also prime) will divide , e.g., , , , , , , , and .  The first four Mersenne primes are , ,  and . A basic theorem about Mersenne numbers states that if  is prime, then the exponent  must also be prime. This follows from the identity \begin{align}2^{ab}-1&=(2^a-1)\cdot \left(1+2^a+2^{2a}+2^{3a}+\cdots+2^{(b-1)a}\right)\\&=(2^b-1)\cdot \left(1+2^b+2^{2b}+2^{3b}+\cdots+2^{(a-1)b}\right). \end{align} This rules out primality for Mersenne numbers with composite exponent, such as . Though the above examples might suggest that  is prime for all primes , this is not the case, and the smallest counterexample is the Mersenne number . The evidence at hand does suggest that a randomly selected Mersenne number is much more likely to be prime than an arbitrary randomly selected integer of similar size. Nonetheless, prime  appear to grow increasingly sparse as  increases. In fact, of the 2,007,537 prime numbers  up to 32,582,657,  is prime for only 44 of them. The lack of any simple test to determine whether a given Mersenne number is prime makes the search for Mersenne primes a difficult task, since Mersenne numbers grow very rapidly. The Lucas–Lehmer primality test (LLT) is an efficient primality test that greatly aids this task. The search for the largest known prime has somewhat of a cult following. Consequently, a lot of computer power has been expended searching for new Mersenne primes, much of which is now done using distributed computing. Mersenne primes are used in pseudorandom number generators such as the Mersenne twister, Park–Miller random number generator, Generalized Shift Register and Fibonacci RNG.  Mersenne primes  are also noteworthy due to their connection to perfect numbers. In the 4th century BC, Euclid proved that if  is prime, then ) is a perfect number. This number, also expressible as , is the th triangular number and the th hexagonal number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that, conversely, all even perfect numbers have this form.Chris K. Caldwell, Mersenne Primes: History, Theorems and Lists This is known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. It is unknown whether there are any odd perfect numbers. Mersenne primes take their name from the 17th-century French scholar Marin Mersenne, who compiled what was supposed to be a list of Mersenne primes with exponents up to 257, as follows: :2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257 His list was completely accurate until 31, but then becomes largely incorrect, as Mersenne mistakenly included  and  (which are composite), and omitted , , and  (which are prime). Mersenne gave little indication how he came up with his list.The Prime Pages, Mersenne's conjecture.  Édouard Lucas proved in 1876 that  is indeed prime, as Mersenne claimed.  This was the largest known prime number for 75 years, and the largest ever found by hand.   was determined to be prime in 1883 by Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin, though Mersenne claimed it was composite, and for this reason it is sometimes called Pervushin's number.  This was the second-largest known prime number, and it remained so until 1911. Lucas had shown another error in Mersenne's list in 1876. Without finding a factor, Lucas demonstrated that  is actually composite. No factor was found until a famous talk by Frank Nelson Cole in 1903.  Without speaking a word, he went to a blackboard and raised 2 to the 67th power, then subtracted one.  On the other side of the board, he multiplied  and got the same number, then returned to his seat (to applause) without speaking. p. 228. He later said that the result had taken him "three years of Sundays" to find. A correct list of all Mersenne primes in this number range was completed and rigorously verified only about three centuries after Mersenne published his list. Fast algorithms for finding Mersenne primes are available, and  the eleven largest known prime numbers are Mersenne primes. The first four Mersenne primes , ,  and  were known in antiquity. The fifth, , was discovered anonymously before 1461; the next two ( and ) were found by Pietro Cataldi in 1588. After nearly two centuries,  was verified to be prime by Leonhard Euler in 1772. The next (in historical, not numerical order) was , found by Édouard Lucas in 1876, then  by Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin in 1883. Two more ( and ) were found early in the 20th century, by R. E. Powers in 1911 and 1914, respectively. The best method presently known for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers is the Lucas–Lehmer primality test. Specifically, it can be shown that for prime ,  is prime if and only if  divides , where  and, for ,  The search for Mersenne primes was revolutionized by the introduction of the electronic digital computer. Alan Turing searched for them on the Manchester Mark 1 in 1949,Brian Napper, The Mathematics Department and the Mark 1. but the first successful identification of a Mersenne prime, , by this means was achieved at 10:00 pm on January 30, 1952 using the U.S. National Bureau of Standards Western Automatic Computer (SWAC) at the Institute for Numerical Analysis at the University of California, Los Angeles, under the direction of Lehmer, with a computer search program written and run by Prof. R. M. Robinson. It was the first Mersenne prime to be identified in thirty-eight years; the next one, , was found by the computer a little less than two hours later. Three more&nbsp;— , , &nbsp;— were found by the same program in the next several months.  is the first Mersenne prime that is titanic,  is the first gigantic, and  was the first megaprime to be discovered, being a prime with at least 1,000,000 digits.The Prime Pages, The Prime Glossary: megaprime. All three were the first known prime of any kind of that size. In September 2008, mathematicians at UCLA participating in GIMPS won part of a $100,000 prize from the Electronic Frontier Foundation for their discovery of a very nearly 13-million-digit Mersenne prime. The prize, finally confirmed in October 2009, is for the first known prime with at least 10 million digits.  The prime was found on a Dell OptiPlex 745 on August 23, 2008.  This is the eighth Mersenne prime discovered at UCLA. On April 12, 2009, a GIMPS server log reported that a 47th Mersenne prime had possibly been found. This report was apparently overlooked until June 4, 2009. The find was verified on June 12, 2009. The prime is . Although it is chronologically the 47th Mersenne prime to be discovered, it is smaller than the largest known at the time, which was the 45th to be discovered. On January 25, 2013, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician at the University of Central Missouri, discovered a 48th Mersenne prime,  (a number with 17,425,170 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network.  This was the third Mersenne prime discovered by Dr. Cooper and his team in the past seven years. On January 19, 2016, Cooper also published about his discovery of a 49th Mersenne prime,  (a number with 22,338,618 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network. This was the fourth Mersenne prime discovered by Dr. Cooper and his team in the past ten years. The table below lists all known Mersenne primes (sequence  () and  () in OEIS): All Mersenne numbers below the 48th Mersenne prime () have been tested at least once but some have not been double-checked. Primes are not always discovered in increasing order. For example, the 29th Mersenne prime was discovered after the 30th and the 31st. Similarly,  was followed by two smaller Mersenne primes, first 2 weeks later and then 8 months later.GIMPS Milestones Report. Retrieved 2015-10-04 The largest known Mersenne prime  is also the largest known prime number. To help visualize its size, displaying the number in base 10 would require 5,957 pages with 75 digits per line and 50 lines per page.  was the first discovered prime number with more than 10 million decimal digits. In modern times, the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime.The largest known prime has been a Mersenne prime since 1952, except between 1989 and 1992; see Caldwell, "The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History" from the Prime Pages website, University of Tennessee at Martin. The factors of a prime number are by definition one, and the number itself - this section is about composite numbers. Mersenne numbers are very good test cases for the special number field sieve algorithm, so often the largest number factorized with this algorithm has been a Mersenne number.  , 2&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 is the record-holder,Thorsten Kleinjung, Joppe Bos, Arjen Lenstra "Mersenne Factorization Factory" http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653.pdf using a variant on the special number field sieve allowing the factorisation of several numbers at once.  See integer factorization records for links to more information. The special number field sieve can factorize numbers with more than one large factor. If a number has only one very large factor then other algorithms can factorize larger numbers by first finding small factors and then making a primality test on the cofactor. , the largest factorization with probable prime factors allowed is , where  is a 1,042,896-digit probable prime.

Signed -bit integers can express values between  and , using the two's complement representation. In the mathematical problem Tower of Hanoi, solving a puzzle with an -disc tower requires  steps, assuming no mistakes are made. The asteroid with minor planet number 8191 is named 8191 Mersenne after Marin Mersenne, because 8191 is a Mersenne prime (3 Juno, 7 Iris, 31 Euphrosyne and 127 Johanna having been discovered and named during the 19th century). A Mersenne–Fermat number is defined as , with  prime,  natural number, and can be written as , when , it is a Mersenne number, and when , it is a Fermat number, the only known Mersenne–Fermat prime with  are  and .A research of Mersenne and Fermat primes In fact, , where  is the cyclotomic polynomial. It is natural to try to generalize primes of the form  to primes of the form  (for  and ). However (see also theorems above),  is always divisible by , so unless the latter is a unit, the former is not a prime. There are two ways to deal with that: In the ring of integers (on real numbers), if  is a unit, then  is either 2 or 0. But  are the usual Mersenne primes, and the formula  does not lead to anything interesting (since it is always −1 for all ). Thus, we can regard a ring of "integers" on complex numbers instead of real numbers, like Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers. If we regard the ring of Gaussian integers, we get the case  and , and can ask (WLOG) for what  the number  is a Gaussian prime which will then be called a Gaussian Mersenne prime.Chris Caldwell: The Prime Glossary: Gaussian Mersenne (part of the Prime Pages)  is a Gaussian prime for the following : 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 19, 29, 47, 73, 79, 113, 151, 157, 163, 167, 239, 241, 283, 353, 367, 379, 457, 997, 1367, 3041, 10141, 14699, 27529, 49207, 77291, 85237, 106693, 160423, 203789, 364289, 991961, 1203793, 1667321, 3704053, 4792057, ...  This sequence is in many ways similar to the list of exponents of ordinary Mersenne primes. The norms (i.e. squares of absolute values) of these Gaussian primes are rational primes: 5, 13, 41, 113, 2113, 525313, 536903681, 140737471578113, ... . We can also regard the ring of Eisenstein integers,  we get the case  and , and can ask for what  the number  is an Eisenstein prime which will then be called a Eisenstein Mersenne prime.  is an Eisenstein prime for the following : 2, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 79, 163, 193, 239, 317, 353, 659, 709, 1049, 1103, 1759, 2029, 5153, 7541, 9049, 10453, 23743, 255361, 534827, 2237561, ...

The other way to deal with the fact that  is always divisible by , it is to simply take out this factor and ask which values of  make \frac{b^n-1}{b-1} be prime. (The integer  can be either positive or negative.) If for example we take , we get  values of: 2, 19, 23, 317, 1031, 49081, 86453, 109297, 270343, ... ,corresponding to primes 11, 1111111111111111111, 11111111111111111111111, ... . These primes are called repunit primes. Another example is when we take , we get  values of: 2, 5, 11, 109, 193, 1483, 11353, 21419, 21911, 24071, 106859, 139739, ... ,corresponding to primes −11, 19141, 57154490053, .... It is a conjecture that for every integer  which is not a perfect power, there are infinitely many values of  such that  is prime. (When  is a perfect power, it can be shown that there is at most one  value such that  is prime) Least  such that  is prime are (starting with ) 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 0, 2, 17, 2, 5, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 19, 3, 3, 2, 5, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 0, 3, 13, 313, 2, 13, 3, 349, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 19, 2, 127, 19, 0, 3, 4229, 2, 11, 3, 17, 7, 3, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 5, 0, 19, 2, 19, 5, 3, 2, 3, 2, ...

Another generized Mersenne number is \frac{a^n-b^n}{a-b} with ,  any coprime integers,  and . (Since  is always divisible by , the division is necessary for there to be any chance of finding prime numbers. In fact, this number is the same as the Lucas number , since  and  are the roots of the quadratic equation , and this number equals 1 when ) We can ask which  make this number prime.  It can be shown that such  must be primes themselves or equal to 4, and  can be 4 if and only if  and  is prime. (Since . Thus, in this case the pair  must be  and  must be prime. That is,  must be in .) It is a conjecture that for any pair  such that for every natural number ,  and  are not both perfect th powers, and if , the absolute values of  and  are not "one is a fourth power, the other is 4 times a fourth power". there are infinitely many values of  such that  is prime.  (When  and  are both perfect th powers for an  or when  and one of their absolute values is a fourth power, the other is 4 times a fourth power, it can be shown that there are at most two  values with this property.) However, this has not been proved for any single value of . (Note: if  and  is even, then the numbers  are not included in the corresponding OEIS sequence.) A conjecture related to the generalized Mersenne primes:Deriving the Wagstaff Mersenne ConjectureGeneralized Repunit Conjecture (the conjecture predicts where is the next generalized Mersenne prime, if the conjecture is true, then there are infinitely many primes for all such  pairs) For any integers  and  which satisfy the conditions: has prime numbers of the form R_p(a,b)=\frac{a^p-b^p}{a-b} for prime , the prime numbers will be distributed near the best fit line Y=G \cdot \log_a(\log_a(R_{(a,b)}(n)))+C where  \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} G=\frac{1}{e^\gamma}=0.561459483566\ldots  and there are about (\log_e(N)+m \cdot \log_e(2) \cdot \log_e \left(\log_e(N))+\frac{1}{\sqrt N}-\delta\right) \cdot \frac{e^\gamma}{\log_e(a)} prime numbers of this form less than . We also have the following three properties: If this conjecture is true, then for all such  pairs, let  be the th prime of the form , the graph of  versus  is almost linear.

In the Rhind papyrus (1650 BC) the Egyptian fraction expansions have fairly different forms for primes and composites, so it may be argued that they knew about prime numbers. See Prime Numbers Divide [Retrieved 2012-11-11]. "The Egyptians used ($) in the table above for the first primes  = 3, 5, 7, or 11 (also for  = 23). Here is another intriguing observation: That the Egyptians stopped the use of ($) at 11 suggests they understood (at least some parts of) Eratosthenes's Sieve 2000 years before Eratosthenes 'discovered' it." The Rhind 2/ Table [Retrieved 2012-11-11]. In the school of Pythagoras (b. about 570 – d. about 495 BC) and the Pythagoreans, we find the first sure observations of prime numbers. Hence the first two Mersenne primes, 3 and 7, were known to and may even be said to have been discovered by them. There is no reference, though, to their special form 22&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 and 23&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 as such. The sources to the knowledge of prime numbers among the Pythagoreans are late. The Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus, AD c. 245–c. 325, states that the Greek Platonic philosopher Speusippus, c. 408 – 339/8 BC, wrote a book named On Pythagorean Numbers. According to Iamblichus this book was based on the works of the Pythagorean Philolaus, c. 470–c. 385 BC, who lived a century after Pythagoras, 570 – c. 495 BC. In his Theology of Arithmetic in the chapter On the Decad, Iamblichus writes: "Speusippus, the son of Plato's sister Potone, and head of the Academy before Xenocrates, compiled a polished little book from the Pythagorean writings which were particularly valued at any time, and especially from the writings of Philolaus; he entitled the book On Pythagorean Numbers. In the first half of the book, he elegantly expounds linear numbers [i.e. prime numbers], polygonal numbers and all sorts of plane numbers, solid numbers and the five figures which are assigned to the elements of the universe, discussing both their individual attributes and their shared features, and their proportionality and reciprocity." Iamblichus The Theology of Arithmetic translated by Robin Waterfiled, 1988, p. 112f. [Retrieved 2012-11-11]. Iamblichus also gives us a direct quote from Speusippus' book where Speusippus among other things writes: "Secondly, it is necessary for a perfect number [the concept "perfect number" is not used here in a modern sense] to contain an equal amount of prime and incomposite numbers, and secondary and composite numbers." Iamblichus The Theology of Arithmetic translated by Robin Waterfiled, 1988, p. 113. [Retrieved 2012-11-11]. For the Greek original text, see Speusippus of Athens: A Critical Study with a Collection of the Related Texts and Commentary by Leonardo Tarán, 1981, p. 140 line 21–22 [Retrieved 2012-11-11] In his comments to  Nicomachus of Gerasas's Introduction to Arithmetic, Iamblichus also mentions that Thymaridas, ca. 400 BC – ca. 350 BC, uses the term rectilinear for prime numbers, and that Theon of Smyrna, fl. AD 100, uses euthymetric and linear as alternative terms. Nicomachus of Gerasa, Introduction to Arithmetic, 1926, p. 127 [Retrieved 2012-11-11] It is unclear though when this said Thymaridas lived. "In a highly suspect passage in Iamblichus, Thymaridas is listed as a pupil of Pythagoras himself."

If  and  are natural numbers such that  is prime, then  or . Proof: . Then , so . Thus . However,  is prime, so  or . In the former case, , hence  (which is a contradiction, as neither &minus;1 nor 0 is prime) or  In the latter case,  or . If , however,  which is not prime. Therefore, . If  is prime, then  is prime. Proof: suppose that  is composite, hence can be written  with a and . Then     so  is composite contradicting our assumption that  is prime. If  is an odd prime, then every prime  that divides  must be 1 plus a multiple of . This holds even when  is prime. Examples: Example I:  is prime, and . Example II: , where , and . Proof: By Fermat's little theorem,  is a factor of . Since  is a factor of , for all positive integers ,  is also a factor of . Since  is prime and  is not a factor of ,  is also the smallest positive integer  such that  is a factor of . As a result, for all positive integers ,  is a factor of  if and only if  is a factor of . Therefore, since  is a factor of ,  is a factor of  so . Furthermore, since  is a factor of , which is odd,  is odd. Therefore, . Note: This fact provides a proof of the infinitude of primes distinct from Euclid's theorem: for every odd prime , all primes dividing  are larger than ; thus there are always larger primes than any particular prime. If  is an odd prime, then every prime  that divides  is congruent to . Proof: , so  is a square root of .  By quadratic reciprocity, every prime modulo which the number 2 has a square root is congruent to . A Mersenne prime cannot be a Wieferich prime. Proof: We show if  is a Mersenne prime, then the congruence  does not hold. By Fermat's little theorem, . Now write, . If the given congruence is satisfied, then ,therefore   . Hence ,and therefore . This leads to , which is impossible since . If  and  are natural numbers then  and  are coprime if and only if  and  are coprime. Consequently a prime number divides at most one prime-exponent Mersenne number,Will Edgington's Mersenne Page so in other words the set of pernicious Mersenne numbers is pairwise coprime. If  and  are both prime (meaning that  is a Sophie Germain prime), and  is congruent to , then  divides .Proof of a result of Euler and Lagrange on Mersenne Divisors Example: 11 and 23 are both prime, and , so 23 divides . Proof: Let  be . By Fermat's little theorem, , so either  or . Supposing latter true, then , so &minus;2 would be a quadratic residue mod . However, since  is congruent to ,  is congruent to  and therefore 2 is a quadratic residue mod . Also since  is congruent to , &minus;1 is a quadratic nonresidue mod , so &minus;2 is the product of a residue and a nonresidue and hence it is a nonresidue, which is a contradiction. Hence, the former congruence must be true and  divides . All composite divisors of prime-exponent Mersenne numbers pass the Fermat primality test for the base 2. The number of digits in the decimal representation of  equals , where  denotes the floor function. , .  and  are coprime. (thus,  cannot be 0) For every natural number ,  and  are not both perfect th powers. (since when  and  are both perfect th powers, it can be shown that there are at most two  value such that  is prime, and these  values are  itself or a root of , or 2) If , the absolute values of  and  are not "one is a fourth power, the other is 4 times a fourth power" (if so, then the number has Aurifeuillean factorization).  is the base of the natural logarithm.  is Euler–Mascheroni constant.  is the logarithm in base .  is the th prime number of the form  for prime .  is a data fit constant which varies with  and .  is a data fit constant which varies with  and .  is the largest natural number such that  and  are both th powers.
