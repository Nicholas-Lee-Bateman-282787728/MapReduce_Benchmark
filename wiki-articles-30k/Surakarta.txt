    Surakarta (Hanacaraka: , often called Solo and less commonly Sala) is a city in Central Java, Indonesia of more than 499,337 people with a population density of 10,853 people/km2. The 46&nbsp;km2 city Badan Pusat Statistik: Luas Daerah menurut Kabupaten/Kota di Provinsi Jawa Tengah Tahun 2009 adjoins Karanganyar Regency and Boyolali Regency to the north, Karanganyar Regency and Sukoharjo Regency to the east and west, and Sukoharjo Regency to the south. Map of Surakarta On the eastern side of Solo lies Solo River (Bengawan Solo). Its built-up (or metro) area made of Surakarta Municipality and 59 districts spread on 7 regencies was home to 3,649,254 inhabitants as of 2010 census.http://www.citypopulation.de/php/indonesia-jawa-admin.php The city is the seat of Surakarta Sunanate keraton (palace/court). Together with Yogyakarta, Surakarta is the heir of the Mataram Kingdom that was split into two kingdoms in 1755. The two built-up area are actually agglomerating each other building a metropolis of more than 7,660,000 inhabitants. Surakarta is the birthplace of the current President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo. He served as Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012. Surakarta is also widely known by the name "Solo" or "Sala". "Surakarta" is used in formal and official contexts. The city has a similar name to the neighboring district of "Kartasura", where the previous capital of Mataram was located. The Dutch name "Soerakarta" influenced the Indonesian spelling "Soerakarta" in use before the 1948 spelling reform. Its ruling family lay claim to being the heirs to the Mataram dynasty. Like Yogyakarta, Solo has two royal palaces. A series of wars and clashes between the Adipati (dukes) followed the death of the last Sultan of Demak Bintoro, the first Islamic kingdom in Java. One of these  was Jaka Tingkir, son-in-law of the late sultan. After defeating the last opponent duke of Jipang-Panola, Jaka Tingkir, also known as Sultan Hadiwijaya, claimed the throne and moved the capital to the city of Pajang, located about 8 miles from present-day Surakarta. His adopted son, Sutawijaya, formed a conspiracy and killed him with the help of an assassin. Then he ascended the throne and once again moved the capital to Mataram in the present-day province of Yogyakarta, and a new dynasty was founded.   Up until 1744, Solo was little more than a quiet backwater village, 10&nbsp;km east of Kartasura, the contemporary capital of the Mataram kingdom. But in that year the Mataram susuhunan (king), Pakubuwono II, backed the Chinese against the Dutch, and the court at Kartasura was sacked as a result. Pakubuwono II searched for a more auspicious spot to rebuild his capital, and in 1745 the entire court was dismantled and transported in a great procession to Surakarta, on the banks of the Kali (River) Solo. February 17, 1745 is regarded as the official birthday of the city. It was said that the place he chose to be the new palace was situated on a small lake. The "babad" or official record of court historians still mentions that the lake was drained by the favor of the mythical queen of the southern sea, Nyi Roro Kidul. However, the decline continued, and in 1757, after the kingdom of Mataram was divided into the Surakarta Sultanate (northern court) and the Yogyakarta Sultanate (southern court), another rival royal house of Mangkunegara was established by Raden Mas Said, also known as Pangeran Samber Nyowo (The Slayer Prince), right in the centre of Solo. It marked the success of the Dutch policy of divide et impera (divide and conquer) in the East Indies. The Mataram held considerable power in Java, yet it submitted to the Dutch. Thereafter, Solo's royal houses quit fighting and instead threw their energies into the arts, developing a highly sophisticated and graceful court culture. The gamelan pavilions became the new theaters of war, with each city competing to produce the more refined court culture. Wayang Kulit and Wayang Wong are some theatrical arts still performed today. The Palace contains a notable museum, which used to house a female chastity belt until it was stolen by thieves. Perhaps the most significant ruler of the 20th century was Pakubuwono X. His relationship with the Dutch, his large family, and his popularity contributed to perhaps the largest funeral procession that ever occurred in Solo.  He had spent a large amount of money on the Royal Graveyard at Imogiri, both the main sections of the graveyard and the new section that he was buried in.  In the era just prior to independence Surakarta had European, Chinese, and Arab quarters. After hearing the proclamation of Indonesian Independence, both Mangkunegara VIII and Pakubuwono XII declared Surakarta a part of the Republic of Indonesia (RI). Because of this support, President Soekarno declared Surakarta the Daerah Istimewa Surakarta (DIS)/"Surakarta Special Region". In October 1945, an anti-"swapraja" (anti-feudalism/anti-monarchy) movement was established in Surakarta. One of the leaders of this movement was Tan Malaka, a member of the Indonesian Communist Party. This organization wanted to abolish all feudal kingdoms in Surakarta and the Surakarta special region (DIS) and replace all regents in Surakarta. The key issue was whether the end of Dutch rule should bring a total change in the government, or whether the ancient and historic institutions, giving the people a link to pre-colonial times, should be retained. On October 17, 1945, KRMH Sosrodiningrat, the vizier of Kasunanan kingdom, was kidnapped and murdered by communists. The new vizier, KRMT Yudonagoro, and 9 other officials from Kepatihan were also kidnapped and murdered by the same movement in March 1946. In 1946, the capital of the Republic of Indonesia (RI) was moved to the nearby city of Yogyakarta. On June 16, 1946, the DIS was abolished and replaced with the regency (kabupaten) of Surakarta. This event is commemorated as the birthday of the city of Surakarta.  This only has administrative and not civic significance. On June 26, 1946, Prime Minister of Indonesia Sutan Syahrir was kidnapped by a rebel movement led by Major General Soedarsono, the commander of the 3rd division. President Soekarno (more often called Sukarno) was angry at this kidnapping and on July 1, 1946, 14 civilian leaders of this movement, including Tan Malaka, were arrested by Indonesian police. On July 2, 1946, the rebel leaders were freed from Wirogunan prison by rebel troops, led by Maj. Gen. Soedarsono. President Soekarno asked the local military commander in Surakarta, Lieutenant Colonel Soeharto (who later became President Soeharto [often spelled Suharto]) to arrest Major General Soedarsono and the rebel group. Lt. Col. Soeharto refused to follow this command unless it was given directly by the Military Chief of Staff, General Soedirman. President Soekarno was angry at this rejection of his authority to give direct commands to all levels of the military, and called Lt. Col. Soeharto a stubborn ("koppig") officer. Lt. Col. Soeharto pretended that he supported the rebellion and persuaded Maj. Gen. Soedarsono and his group to stay at his headquarters at Wiyoro, Surakarta for their own safety. Later that night he persuaded Maj. Gen. Soedarsono to meet President Soekarno at his palace the next morning. Lt. Col. Soeharto secretly informed the presidential guard troops about Maj. Gen. Soedarsono's plan on the next morning.  On July 3, 1946, Maj. Gen. Soedarsono and his group were arrested by the presidential guard near the palace. Prime Minister Syahrir was released unharmed. Several months later, Maj. Gen. Soedarsono and his group were pardoned and released from prison. Later this rebellion was called the "failed July 3, 1946 coup". This event is mentioned in President Soeharto's autobiography published in 1988. From 1945 to 1948, the Dutch re-occupied various regions in Java. The remaining areas of the Republic of Indonesia were in Yogyakarta, Surakarta, and surrounding areas. In December 1948, the Dutch attacked and occupied the cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta.  The Indonesian army led by General Soedirman started a guerrilla war from surrounding areas. The Dutch said that the Republic was destroyed and no longer existed. To disprove this claim, the Indonesian army conducted large-scale raids into the cities of Jogyakarta and Surakarta, called Serangan Oemoem. The Indonesian troops managed to beat the Dutch troops and occupy the city for several hours. The leader of the raid to Yogyakarta was Lt. Col. Soeharto. The leader of a similar raid on Surakarta on August 7, 1949 was Lt. Col. Slamet Riyadi. To commemorate this event, the main street of the city of Surakarta was renamed "Brigadier General Slamet Riyadi Street". By 1950 Surakarta had a population of 165,484.Columbia-Lippencott Gazeteer In 1950 Surakarta, or Solo, was a trade center for such agricultural products as rice, rubber, corn, indigo, cassava, and sugar. It also had seen the development of some industries. These included tanning, textiles, and machinery. Also batik making was a common activity.  From October 1965 to 1966, there was large-scale chaos in Central Java, following an abortive coup and the subsequent killings of 1965â€“66. In May 1998, there was a large riot in Surakarta. It was initially triggered by rising oil prices, with an angry mob ransacking and setting many buildings on fire, particularly banks and official government buildings. But then the situation became uncontrolled as the mob also targeted shopping centers and other commercial buildings for destruction, before it finally turned into a racial riot as rioters targeted houses and business assets of the local Indonesian-Chinese, leading to widespread destruction in the region.  Surakarta is a lowland lying on flat terrain 105&nbsp;m above sea level (in the city center about 95&nbsp;m above sea level), with an area of 44.1&nbsp;km2 (0.14% of the area of Central Java). It is approximately  northeast of Yogyakarta and  southeast of Semarang. The eastern part of the town is bordered by Bengawan Solo River, the longest river on Java. The river is the inspiration for the song "Bengawan Solo", a 1940s composition by Gesang Martohartono which became famous throughout much of Asia. The city's soil is fertile because of the river and its tributaries. The city is surrounded by Merbabu and Mount Merapi (3,151&nbsp;m high) to the west and Mount Lawu (3265&nbsp;m high) to the east. The Sewu Mountain Range lies further south. Nearby is also the infamous Mount Kemukus (also known as Sex Mountain). The water sources for Surakarta are in the valley of Merapi, a total of 19 locations, with a capacity of 3,404 l/second. The average source water height is 800â€“1,200&nbsp;m above sea level. In 1890â€“1927 there were only 12 wells in Surakarta. Today, underground water wells in 23 locations produce about 45 l/second.PDAM Solo: The Greater Surakarta In March 2006, Surakarta's state water company (PDAM) had a production capacity of 865.02 l/second: from Cokrotulung, Klaten, 27&nbsp;km from Solo, 387 l/s; and from 26 deep wells, with a total capacity of 478,02 l/second. The total reservoir capacity is 9,140 m3 and can serve 55,22% of the population. Produksi air The soil in Solo is fertile, partly because of the volcanic activity of Mounts Merapi and Lawu. Combined with abundant water source, makes the hinterland good for planting vegetables, food and cash crops. But in the last 20 years, manufacturing industry and tourism have been booming and agriculture declining. Under the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, Surakarta features a tropical monsoon climate. The city has a lengthy wet season spanning from October through June, and a relatively short dry season covering the remaining three months (July through September). On average Surakarta receives just under 2200&nbsp;mm of rainfall annually, with its wettest months being December, January, and February. As is common in areas featuring a tropical monsoon climate, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year. Surakarta's average temperature is roughly 30 degrees Celsius every month. Surakarta borders the Karanganyar and Boyolali Regency in the west and north, Karanganyar and Sukoharjo Regency in the east, and Sukoharjo Regency in the south. At each of the city borders stands a gapura keraton or Javanese entrance monument, erected in 1931â€“32 during the reign of Pakubuwono X in Kasunanan Surakarta. Each of them serves as a border and an entry point to the capital of Keraton Surakarta with the neighboring territories. The gapuras were built not only on highways but also on the riverside of Bengawan Solo. Bengawan Solo used to be a port and crossing point (in Mojo/Silir). The gapuras were built in two sizes, large and small. Large gapuras were built on major roadways. They can be seen in Grogol (south), Kerten and Jurug (east). Small gapuras can be seen near Dr. Oen Hospital (north), on the road to Baki in Solo Baru (south), Makamhaji (west), and in Mojo/Silir. Each of the large gapuras also has a stele that contains the name of the reigning monarch and the year that it was built. Gapura Batas Kota (Keraton)  Surakarta City and its surrounding regencies, Karanganyar, Sragen, Wonogiri, Sukoharjo, Klaten, and Boyolali, are collectively called the ex-Surakarta Residency (Dutch: Residentie Soerakarta). After Surakarta became a city, it was divided into five districts (kecamatan), each led by a camat, and subdivided into 51 kelurahan, each led by a lurah. The districts of Surakarta are: Kecamatan dan Desa/Kelurahan menurut Kabupaten/Kota di Provinsi Jawa Tengah Tahun 2005, 2008 dan 2009 Surakarta as a dense core city in Central Java, and its second city, spills considerably into neighboring regencies.  Though a traffic study quotes the population as 1,158,000 as of 2008,http://www.cdia.asia/sharedfiles/PFS%20Training%20for%20NPOs%20presentations/Day%203/Surakarta%20Transport%20PFS%20Executive%20Summary.pdf this reflects only the very core, as the city affects entire neighboring regencies by significantly driving up overall population densities in Sukoharjo Regency and Klaten Regency over the already dense countryside.  Furthermore, the government of Indonesia officially defines a broader region as Surakarta's extended metropolitan zone, with the acronym Subosukawonosraten as the city and 6 surrounding regencies.,http://jurnal.pdii.lipi.go.id/admin/jurnal/131102025_1410-9409.pdfhttp://www.bappenas.go.id/get-file-server/node/7642/ though obviously not a core metropolitan area as some of its regencies are not particularly suburbanized, it reflects a broader planning region.  Both the metropolitan area and extended areas border Yogyakarta's metropolitan area, while only the extended metropolitan area borders Kedungsapur or Greater Semarang.  See also List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia. In the current Indonesian context, Surakarta is a city within the province of Central Java.  Previous to the Indonesian nation being formed, it was an autonomous kingdom ruled by the Susuhunan (Sunan) and a principality ruled by the Adipati Mangkunegara. During Dutch occupation Yogyakarta and Surakarta were known as the Vorstenland  or principalities. Rivalry between the two has been endemic since their founding in the 18th century and was a deliberate ploy by the Dutch to distract attention from the presence of the Dutch colonial power. The hereditary ruler of the keraton or main court within the city bears the title of Pakubuwono, the present king being Pakubuwono XIII. Like Yogyakarta, Surakarta also has a junior court, born of another civil war: the Mangkunegaran, a small principality inside Kasunanan, of which Mangkunegara IX is the present monarch. Neither holds any political power and according to Indonesian law, both only have civilian status. The current mayor of Surakarta  (until 2015) is F.X. Hadi Rudyatmo, who replaced Joko Widodo in 2012 after the latter was elected as Governor of Jakarta in 2012. Under Joko Widodo's mayorship, the city had experienced a marked improvement. He rebranded and promoted Solo as "The Spirit of Java," a Javanese culture and heritage center, batik capital, and tourist-friendly city. Juridically, the City of Surakarta was formed based on Government Regulation No. 16/SD 1946, announced at July 15, 1946. Based on several historical factors, 16 June 1946 is set as the anniversary of the Government of Surakarta. The city anniversary itself is celebrated every 16 February, based on the date of the moving of the palace from Kartasura to Surakarta in 1745. On 16 February 2011, the city celebrated its 256th anniversary. One of the earliest censuses held in Surakarta Residency (Residentie Soerakarta) was in 1885. At that time, with an area of about 5,677&nbsp;kmÂ², there were 1,053,985 people in Surakarta Residency, including 2,694 Europeans and 7,543 Indonesian-Chinese. The area, 130 times the current area of Surakarta, had a population density of 186 people/kmÂ². The capital of the residency itself (roughly the size of the City of Solo proper) in 1880 had 124,041 people living in it.
