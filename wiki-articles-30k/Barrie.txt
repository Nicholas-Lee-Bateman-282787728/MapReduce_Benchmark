    Barrie is a city in Central Ontario, Canada, on the western shore of Lake Simcoe. Although located in Simcoe County, the city is politically independent.  Barrie is  within the northern part of the Greater Golden Horseshoe, a densely populated and industrialized region of Ontario. In 2011 census, the city's population was originally reported as 135,711, making it the 34th largest in Canada. The city's 2011 population was subsequently revised to 136,063. The Barrie census metropolitan area (CMA) had a population of 187,013 residents, making it the 21st largest CMA in Canada.  At its inception, Barrie was an establishment of houses and warehouses at the foot of the Nine Mile Portage from Kempenfelt Bay to Fort Willow, an aboriginal transportation route that existed centuries before Europeans came to Simcoe County.  The portage linked Kempenfelt Bay through Willow Creek, connecting Lake Simcoe to the Nottawasaga River which flows into Georgian Bay off Lake Huron. Barrie played an integral role in the War of 1812.  During the War, the city became a supply depot for British forces, and in addition, the Nine Mile Portage was adopted by the British Military as a key piece of their supply line which provided a strategic path for communication, personnel, and vital supplies and equipment to and from Fort Willow and Georgian Bay / Lake Huron.  Today, the Nine Mile Portage is marked by signs along roads in Barrie and in Springwater Township. You can follow the scenic path from Memorial Square all the way to Fort Willow. The city was named in 1833 after Sir Robert Barrie, who was in charge of the naval forces in Canada and frequently commanded forces through the city and along the Nine Mile Portage. Barrie was also the final destination for one branch of the Underground Railroad.  In the mid-19th century, this network of secret routes allowed many American slaves to enter Barrie and the surrounding area.  This contributed to the development (and name) of nearby Shanty Bay. By 1869, Barrie was the county seat of Simcoe in the Township of Vespra with a population 3,000. It was a station of the Northern Railway. It was pleasantly situated on Kempenfelt Bay, Lake Simcoe. There were steamers to the Muskoka Territory Orillia & Stages to Penetanguishene.The province of Ontario gazetteer and directory. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869 During World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy named a Flower class corvette HMCS Barrie. On 7 September 1977, a private aircraft dropped altitude to 500 feet (150 m) in dense fog, struck the 1,000-foot (300 m) CKVR-TV tower, killing all five on the plane and destroying the tower and antenna. The station's 225-foot (69 m) auxiliary tower was also destroyed and there was some damage to the main studio.   CKVR were back on the air using a temporary 400' tower and reduced power of 40,000 watts at 8:55am on 19 September.  The new  1,000-foot (300 m) tower was rebuilt in 1978. On 31 May 1985, an F4 tornado struck Barrie. It was one of the most violent and deadliest tornadoes in Canadian history. On 12–13 June 1987, a sculpture called Spirit Catcher by Ron Baird was moved to Barrie from Vancouver, British Columbia, where it had been exhibited as part of Expo '86. The sculpture was erected permanently at the foot of Maple Avenue on the shore of Kempenfelt Bay. However, with the re-development along the waterfront/Lakeshore Drive, the city is considering moving the Spirit Catcher to the gravel outcropping at the foot of Bayfield Street. In January 2004, Barrie made international news when its city police raided the former Molson brewery, and found Canada's largest illegal cannabis grow operation. Barrie's Park Place (formerly Molson Park) was chosen to host Live 8 Canada on 2 July 2005.[ ]  The success of the concert contributed to the resistance to a plan to convert the concert area to a commercial district. However, the stage, buildings and many of the trees on site have been destroyed since construction of the Park Place commercial district has begun. An explosion in the Royal Thai restaurant, housed in the landmark Wellington Hotel, at the historic Five Points intersection in Barrie's downtown core occurred at 11:20 PM on 6 December 2007. The fire quickly spread to several neighbouring buildings. Firefighters battled the blaze well into the following morning, requiring assistance from other Simcoe County fire services. Officials estimate the damages to be in the millions. The Wellington Hotel building collapsed. It was over one hundred years old. On 17 February 2008, two people were charged in connection with the fire, after the Ontario Fire Marshal's office concluded the explosion and fire were the result of arson. Barrie is located in the central portion of Southern Ontario, approximately  north of Toronto within the Greater Golden Horseshoe subregion. It is accessible via Highways 26, 400, 11. Barrie's historic downtown area is situated in a distinct curved or wrapped valley, surrounding the western edge of Kempenfelt Bay (part of Lake Simcoe. Terrain is generally flat near the city's centre. Moving up the valley slopes toward the city's north and south ends, the terrain can be rather steep in some areas. The city does not have any major rivers within its limits, but does have numerous creeks and streams, most of which empty into Kempenfelt Bay. Barrie has been designated an Urban Growth Centre by the Province of Ontario (Places to Grow Simcoe Area, 2009). Its population growth, largely due to its emergence as a bedroom community for Toronto, has given rise to the development of numerous subdivisions on the southern side of the city. Barrie successfully annexed  of land from the neighbouring Town of Innisfil to the south and southeast on 1 January 2010.[ ]  The annexation comprised lands south beyond McKay Road and west of the 10th Sideroad, and as far south as Lockhart Road on the east side of the 10th Sideroad.[ ]  The annexation was intended to allow Barrie to meet its growing population demands without having to extend into the countryside on the northern, western, and eastern boundaries of the city's limits. Like the rest of southern Ontario, Barrie has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb), with warm, humid summers and cold winters. In late spring and summer months, the Barrie area is known for heavy thunderstorm activity, due to its location within a convergence of breezes originating from Georgian Bay, Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. In the winter months, the proximity to the Great Lakes moderates winter temperatures but also results in significant snowfall in the general area. Barrie is on the southern edge of Ontario's snowbelt region, where lake-effect snow, primarily from Georgian Bay, falls throughout the winter. An average of 238 centimetres (95&nbsp;inches) of snow falls annually, with at least 50% due to the lake effect. Since the snowfall gradient is tight, snowfall totals tend to be significantly higher just north of the city as compared with the south end. Barrie experienced tornadoes during the Barrie tornado outbreak of 1985 and the June 16–18, 2014 tornado outbreak during which an EF2 tornado spawned and caused minimal damage to southern Barrie but affected the nearby town of Angus to a greater extent.   In the 2011 Census, Barrie originally had a population of 135,711 living in 49,943 of its 52,185 total dwellings, a 5.7% change from its 2006 population of 128,430. Statistics Canada subsequently amended the 2011 census results to a population of 136,063 living in 50,075 of its 52,329 total dwellings, a 5.9% change from 2006. With a land area of , it had a population density of  in 2011. Barrie's median age is 37.2 years compared with the national average of 40.6 years. Comparatively, the Barrie CMA had a population of 187,013 living in 68,495 of its 72,817 total dwellings, a 5.6% change from its 2006 population of 177,061. With a land area of , the CMA had a population density of  in 2011. According to the 2011 National Household Survey,  of Barrie residents were Canadian citizens while  were not. The median value of a dwelling in Barrie is $276,279, which is almost on par with the national average of $280,552. Religious affiliations, 2011 The following are some of the city's major employers: Notwithstanding these major employers, Barrie has increasingly been perceived as a bedroom community for those commuting to Toronto, which is approximately  south of Barrie.  Approximately 32% of the resident-employed labour force (17,040 persons/53,400 persons) commute out of Barrie for employment purposes, however, approximately 28% of the resident-employed labour force (14,880 persons/53,400 persons) commute into Barrie for employment for a net out-commuting figure of only 4.26% (17,040 persons&nbsp;–14,880  persons)/(50,665 persons employed in Barrie)).

Downtown Barrie hosts many older buildings that have been kept up over the years or given new facades that exemplify their historical importance.  Many specialty shops, boutiques, pubs and restaurants are located throughout downtown Barrie, most notably along Dunlop Street East.  Downtown Barrie is becoming well known for its fashion boutiques, local art, live theatre, indie-music and nightlife scenes.

The current mayor of Barrie is Jeff Lehman, who was elected in November 2010, succeeding Dave Aspden. Barrie has a long military history dating back to at least the Nine Mile Portage of the War of 1812. By the time of the 1837 Rebellion, Simcoe County had a sufficient population to form a battlion of Sedentary Militia of almost 600 strong.  This battlion was involved in marching alleged rebels down Yonge Street to Toronto in order to face justice.  By 1855, Barrie was home to an independent company of Rifle Company of militia, followed in 1863 by a company of Infantry. These companies served during the Fenian Raids. With the Militia Act of 1866, the companies in Barrie were respectively organized as Number 1 and Number 5 companies, in the newly formed 35th Battalion of Infantry (Simcoe Foresters), gazetted on 14 September 1866. In 1885, four companies the 35th Simcoe Foresters, including those from Barrie, formed with four companies from the 12th York Battalion to form the York-Simcoe Battalion.  This specially raised battalion served in Western Canada during the Northwest Rebellion, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.E. O'Brien of Shanty Bay, Ontario. For its efforts, The Simcoe Foresters received its first Battle Honour "Northwest Canada 1885." Citizens of Barrie would next volunteer for military service during the Boer War in South Africa 1899-1902.  It was during this conflict that at the Battle of Paardeberg the citizens of Barrie and The Simcoe Foresters suffered their first fatal casualty, Private James Halkett Findlay.  Private Findlay was killed-in-action on 18 February 1900, while serving with C Company of the 2nd Battalion Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry. In 1914, the First World War broke out and many citizens of Barrie were quick to volunteer for service overseas with The Simcoe Foresters.  Late the following year, the Regiment was tasked with raising two overseas battalions, the 157th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF and the 177th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF.  In the spring of 1916, the Barrie and Collingwood companies of the 157th Battalion began clearing the land and construction of the new military camp on the Simcoe Pines Plain - Camp Borden (now CFB Borden).  This began Barrie's long friendship with the Base. With a re-organization of the Canadian Militia between the two World Wars, The Simcoe Foresters, headquartered in Barrie, were amalgamated in 1936 with the Grey Regiment, headquartered at Owen Sound, Ontario.  This event created the present-day regiment of The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, which is headquartered at the Armoury in Queen's Park, downtown Barrie. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, citizens of Barrie volunteered for service overseas with The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force.  The City of Barrie sponsored a ship in the RCN, HMCS Barrie K-138, a Flower class corvette.   Barrie is served by Provincial Highway Highway&nbsp;400, which acts as the primary route between Barrie and Toronto. Highway&nbsp;400 bisects the city on a roughly north-south basis. Highway&nbsp;26, also located in the city, is the main route to the Collingwood area and is known as Bayfield Street within the city limits. Barrie was once served by Highway&nbsp;27, Highway&nbsp;90, Highway&nbsp;93, Highway&nbsp;131 and Highway&nbsp;11. However, the province downgraded many highways in 1997 and 1998; these highways are now known as Simcoe County Road&nbsp;27, Simcoe County Road&nbsp;90 (Dunlop Street), Simcoe County Road&nbsp;93 and Simcoe County Road&nbsp;30. The portion of Highway&nbsp;11 through Barrie is known as Yonge Street, though it is actually part of the Penetanguishene Road Major arterial roads within the city include Mapleview Drive, Ferndale Drive, 10th Line, Big Bay Point Road, Essa Road, Huronia Road and Bayfield Street.
