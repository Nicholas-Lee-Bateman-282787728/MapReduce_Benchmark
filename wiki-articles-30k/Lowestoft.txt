     Lowestoft (,  or ) is a town in the English county of Suffolk.OS Explorer Map OL40: The Broads: (1:25 000) : ISBN 0 319 24086 X.   The town is on the North Sea coast and is the most easterly settlement of the United Kingdom.  It is  north-east of London,  north-east of Ipswich and  south-east of Norwich.  It is situated on the edge of The Broads system and is the major settlement within the district of Waveney with a population of 71,010 in 2011 Some of the earliest evidence of settlement in Britain has been found in Lowestoft and the town has a long history.  It is a port town which developed due to the fishing industry, and a traditional seaside resort.  It has wide, sandy beaches, two piers and a number of other tourist attractions.  Whilst its fisheries have declined, the development of oil and gas exploitation in the southern North Sea in the 1960s led to the development of the town, along with nearby Great Yarmouth, as a base for the industry.  This role has since declined and the town has begun to develop as a centre of the renewable energy industry within the East of England. Following the discovery of flint tools in the cliffs at Pakefield in south Lowestoft in 2005, the human habitation of the Lowestoft area can be traced back 700,000&nbsp;years.

In the 19th&nbsp;century, the arrival of Sir Samuel Morton Peto brought about a change in Lowestoft's fortunes. Railway contractor Peto was contracted by the Lowestoft Railway & Harbour Company to build a railway line between Lowestoft and Reedham. This stimulated the further development of the fishing industry and the Port of Lowestoft in general.Port of Lowestoft, Lowestoft Maritime Museum, February 2011. Retrieved 2011-04-15. The development of the port boosted trade with the continent. Peto's railway not only enabled the fishing industry to get its product to market, but assisted the development of other industries such as engineering and helped to establish Lowestoft as a flourishing seaside holiday resort. During World War I, Lowestoft was bombarded by the German Navy on 24&nbsp;April 1916 in conjunction with the Easter Rising.
