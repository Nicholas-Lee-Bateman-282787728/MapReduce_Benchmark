   Frankston is an outer-southeastern suburb of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, in the local government area of the City of Frankston. It is 41&nbsp;km south of the Melbourne city centre, at the northernmost point of the Mornington Peninsula. Due to its geographic location, it is often referred to as "the gateway to the Mornington Peninsula". European settlement of Frankston began around the same time as the foundation of Melbourne in 1835—initially as an unofficial fishing village serving the early Melbourne township. Prior to its European settlement, the Frankston area was inhabited primarily by the Mayone-bulluk clan from the Bunurong tribe of the Kulin nation. The new village of Frankston was officially established after formal land sales took place in 1854. It has given its name to the broader Frankston local government area since 1893, and serves as both its activity and administrative centre. Situated on the eastern shoreline of Port Phillip, Frankston has been a popular seaside destination of Melbourne since the mid-1880s. Frankston Beach remains one of the most frequented in Victoria, and is recognised as one of the cleanest in Australia. It is also home to one of the largest annual festivals of sand art exhibition in the Southern Hemisphere. Localities in the suburb (with the postcode 3199) include Frankston Central Business District (CBD), Frankston East, Frankston Heights, Karingal, Long Island, Mount Erin and Olivers Hill. The independent suburb of Frankston South also shares the same postcode as Frankston. According to the 2011 Australian census, the suburb of Frankston had a population of 35,009.

Retrieved 13 October 2009 The origins of the name "Frankston" is subject to conjecture. An enduring theory is that it was named after one of its first official land owners, Frank Liardet, eldest son of early Melbourne pioneer Wilbraham Liardet, who established his Ballam Park estate in 1854 (in what is now the Frankston locality of Karingal). However, in a letter to the editor of The Argus newspaper (published on 30 May 1916), a member of the Liardet family said that this was in fact not true.Liardet, C. Evelyn (30 May 1916). "Naming of Frankston". The Argus (1846–1957). p. 9. Retrieved 29 January 2014 The letter included excerpts of correspondence between the Liardet family and the Victorian state Department of Lands and Survey which refuted the theory, and instead states that Frankston was named after Charles Franks—an early Melbourne settler who was killed by Indigenous Australians. Charles Franks arrived in Melbourne in 1836 and made a squatting claim to land on the western side of Port Phillip near Mount Cottrel (northeast of what is now the Melbourne outer-western suburb of Wyndham Vale). Franks' land neighboured that of early Melbourne explorer and surveyor John Helder Wedge, which was managed by his nephew Charles Wedge prior to gaining a pre-emptive right to land license for the Frankston area. The correspondence with the Department of Lands and Survey states that, at the time of surveying the Frankston area, the name "Frankston" was probably suggested to honour the Wedge's deceased former neighbour. Another theory—that has become folklore—is that Frankston was named after a pub named "Frank Stone's Hotel".Charlwood, Don (8 February 1930). "Early History of Frankston" (first article in a series). The Frankston & Somerville Standard. p. 6. Retrieved 29 January 2014 In 1929, author Don Charlwood, a student of Frankston High School at the time, compiled an early history of Frankston using local records and oral sources supporting this theory—which was published in The Frankston & Somerville Standard newspaper the following year. The pub to which Charlwood refers, originally named the Cannanuke Inn, was the first permanent building in the Frankston area, and was built by pre-emptive Frankston settler James Davey in the mid-1840s. The Victorian Heritage Database states that it was located on the present site of the Frankston Mechanics' Institute, at 1R Plowman Place in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD).Former Cannanuke Inn site. Victorian Heritage Database. Heritage Victoria. Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure. Government of Victoria.

As there appear to be no licensing records for the Cannanuke Inn, it is difficult to determine if this is in fact true. However, Charlwood does mention that Stone had purchased the Cannanuke Inn from "a man named Standring". Licensing records state that Benjamin Standring was the owner of the Frankston Hotel from 1857 to 1860.Staff Writer (22 April 1857). "County of Bourke Licensing Session". The Age.

Davey did not have the right to sell or sub-let the Cannanuke Inn. It is therefore unlikely that Stone purchased or leased the Cannanuke Inn from Davey or Standring before the formal land sales for Frankston in 1854—and after which the name "Frankston" was already in use.Map of the Village of Frankston at Kananook Creek, Mount Eliza, Port Phillip Bay (1 May 1854).

Retrieved 29 September 2015 According to author Michael Jones, in his history book Frankston: Resort to City, Frankston was named after British army general Sir Thomas Harte Franks. Jones' theory is strengthened by the fact that a number of other places near Frankston such as Cranbourne, Hastings, Lyndhurst, Mornington and Pakenham also have names derived from British army generals and statesmen. Jones suggests that Sir Andrew Clarke, the Surveyor General of Victoria from 1853 to 1858, named all of these places.  Prior to the foundation of Melbourne by Europeans in 1835, the area surrounding Port Phillip was originally populated by Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation for an estimated 31,000 to 40,000 years. Particularly, the Frankston area was inhabited primarily by the Mayone-bulluk clan from the Bunurong tribe of the Kulin nation. The tribes of the Kulin nation were a nomadic people with no sedentary settlements. Instead, the tribes would travel between areas of their respective territories under the influence of the weather. As a result, there is minimal physical evidence of their past. The Bunurong tribe in particular were mainly hunter-gatherers that maintained an ecologically sustainable tradition of travelling between past designated areas of seasonally abundant resources. For the Mayone-bulluk clan of the Frankston area, Kananook Creek and the swamps and wetlands in the north, and Sweetwater Creek in the south, were a rich source of fish and eels as well as summer fruits and vegetables.Frankston Coastal Arts Discovery Trail (2006). City of Frankston. p. 15 An important meeting place for the clans of the Bunurong tribe on the Mornington Peninsula was the present site of the Frankston Mechanics' Institute, at 1N Plowman Place in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD), which was used for corroborees and as a trading place.Frankston Coastal Arts Discovery Trail (2006). City of Frankston. p. 23. Retrieved 8 October 2015 Bunurong territory, of which Frankston is a part, stretches from the Werribee River in the western metropolitan area of Melbourne east to Wilsons Promontory in Gippsland and was referred to as marr-ne-beek ("excellent country") amongst the Kulin nation tribes. According to the Indigenous Australian mythology of the Dreamtime, the Bunurong territory was created by the ancestor spirit Lohan. Patrilineally, all Bunurong tribe members are considered a direct descendent of Lohan. The creator of the Kulin nation-proper was the deity eaglehawk spirit Bunjil, and the protector of its waterways and keeper of the wind was the trickster crow spirit Waa. Bunjil and Waa are the two moiety totems that govern the kinship system of the Kulin nation tribes. The Mayone-bulluk clan of the Frankston area was closely linked through marriage to the Wurundjeri-balluk clan of the Melbourne city centre area, from the neighbouring Woiwurrung tribe, based on this system.

The earliest recorded encounter of the Bunurong tribe with Europeans in the Frankston area was in early-1803, when Captain Charles Robbins sailed his ship the Cumberland into Port Phillip on the surveying expedition headed by Charles Grimes. On 30 January, Grimes went ashore at Kananook Creek in search of fresh water and made peaceful contact with "around 30 of the natives"—most likely members of the Mayone-bulluk clan. Another possible encounter of the Mayone-bulluk clan with Europeans in 1803 was in late-December, with three convicts that had escaped from the failed settlement by Captain David Collins at Sorrento on the southern Mornington Peninsula. Among the escapees was William Buckley, who later lived with the Wadawurrung-balug clan from the neighbouring Wathaurong tribe of the Kulin nation for 32 years. After travelling north up the Mornington Peninsula for two days, Buckley describes coming to a creek that ran "near to the bay"—most likely Kananook Creek and Long Island in the Frankston area—where they encountered a "large tribe of the natives...armed with spears" but did not make direct contact. The number of Bunurong tribe members at the time of contact with Europeans in the 1800s was estimated to be 300. James Fleming, a member of Charles Grimes' surveying expedition in early 1803, reported observing smallpox scars on members of the Kulin nation tribes he had encountered—indicating that an epidemic had affected them prior to 1803. Smallpox arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788 and reached the Port Philip area in 1790, via the first European settlement in Australia at Port Jackson, claiming at least half the population of the combined Kulin nation tribes. Following permanent European settlement in 1835, another smallpox epidemic reduced the number of Bunurong tribe members to 83 by 1839. An influenza epidemic during the 1840s further reduced their number to 28 by 1850. The last full-blood member of the Bunurong tribe, Yam-mer-book, also known as Jimmy Dunbar (from the Ngaruk-Willam clan, which was geographically close to the Mayone-bulluk clan) who lived to the north of Frankston near Mordialloc, died of natural causes in 1877.

During the Miocene epoch in the Neogene period, the Frankston area was entirely flooded by the sea resulting in a mix of Balcombe Clay (at deep levels) and Baxter Sandstone (at shallow levels) covering the basaltic (lava) level. Fluctuating ice ages of the Pleistocene epoch in the current Quaternary period caused sea levels to rise and fall dramatically and for sedimentary rock and sand to be deposited on the surface of the hill. Aeolian processes in the current Holocene epoch, in which Port Phillip has periodically dried up (as recently as 1000 years ago), has caused further sand to be deposited.
