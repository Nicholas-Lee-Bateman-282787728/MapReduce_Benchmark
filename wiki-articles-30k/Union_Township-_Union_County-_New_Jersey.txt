"UNION, the third oldest English settlement in New Jersey after Newark and Elizabeth, is returning to its Colonial roots.... Union was settled in 1667 by Puritans, who left Connecticut fearing religious persecution. Then called Connecticut Farms, the community figured prominently in shipbuilding from the late 17th century, when the Headleys, one of its first European families, established a factory for wooden hoops to hold sails to masts."

On June 6, 1780, British troops, led by Hessian General Wilhelm von Knyphausen, boarded boats on Staten Island bound for Elizabeth, New Jersey.  At midnight, 5,000 troops started to land.

They were wrong on both counts and were unable to make their way to and through the Hobart Gap.Yesenko, Michael R.
