     Veganism is both the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals.For veganism and animals as commodities: Helena Pedersen, Vasile Staescu, "Conclusion: Future Directions for Critical Animal Studies," in Nik Taylor, Richard Twine (eds.), The Rise of Critical Animal Studies: From the Margins to the Centre, Routledge, 2014 (pp.&nbsp;262–276), p.&nbsp;267: "&nbsp;... we are vegan because we are ethically opposed to the notion that life (human or otherwise) can, or should, ever be rendered as a buyable or sellable commodity." Gary Steiner, Animals and the Limits of Postmodernism, Columbia University Press, 2013, p.&nbsp;206: "&nbsp;... ethical veganism, the principle that we ought as far as possible to eschew the use of animals as sources of food, labour, entertainment and the like&nbsp;... [This means that animals]&nbsp;... are entitled not to be eaten, used as forced field labor, experimented upon, killed for materials to make clothing and other commodities of use to human beings, or held captive as entertainment." Gary Francione, "Animal Welfare, Happy Meat and Veganism as the Moral Baseline," in David M. Kaplan, The Philosophy of Food, University of California Press, 2012 (pp.&nbsp;169–189) p.&nbsp;182: "Ethical veganism is the personal rejection of the commodity status of nonhuman animals&nbsp;..." Gary Steiner, "Animal, Vegetable, Miserable", The New York Times, 21 November 2009: "People who are ethical vegans believe that differences in intelligence between human and non-human animals have no moral significance whatsoever. The fact that my cat can't appreciate Schubert's late symphonies and can't perform syllogistic logic does not mean that I am entitled to use him as an organic toy, as if I were somehow not only morally superior to him but virtually entitled to treat him as a commodity with minuscule market value." For commodification of animals in general: Kathryn Gillespie, "Nonhuman animal resistance and the improprieties of live property," in Irus Braverman (ed.), Animals, Biopolitics, Law, Routledge, 2015, chapter six. See in particular the section "The Animal-as-Commodity." Rosemary-Claire Collard, Kathryn Gillespie, "Introduction," in Kathryn Gillespie, Rosemary-Claire Collard (eds.), Critical Animal Geographies, Routledge, 2015, p.&nbsp;2. Gregory R.

Ronald Engel, Laura Westra, Klaus Bosselman (eds.), Democracy, Ecological Integrity and International Law, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009. A follower of veganism is known as a vegan. Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming animal products, not only meat but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances. The term ethical vegan is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animal products for any purpose. Another term is environmental veganism, which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.Michael Shapiro, "Sea Shepherd's Paul Watson: 'You don't watch whales die and hold signs and do nothing'", The Guardian, 21 September 2010. Matthew Cole, "Veganism," in Margaret Puskar-Pasewicz (ed.), Cultural Encyclopedia of Vegetarianism, ABC-Clio, 2010 (pp.&nbsp;239–241), p.&nbsp;241. The term vegan was coined in 1944 by Donald Watson when he co-founded the Vegan Society in England, at first to mean "non-dairy vegetarian" and later "the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals."Donald Watson, Vegan News, No. 1, November 1944, p.&nbsp;2; Leslie Cross, "Veganism Defined", The Vegetarian World Forum, 5(1), Spring 1951. Interest in veganism increased in the 2010s; vegan stores opened, and vegan options became available in more supermarkets and restaurants in many countries. Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fibre, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals, and lower in calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12. Well-planned vegan diets can reduce the risk of some types of chronic disease, including heart disease, and are regarded as appropriate for all stages of the life-cycle by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, and Dietitians of Canada. Because uncontaminated plant foods do not provide vitamin B12 (which is produced by microorganisms such as bacteria), researchers agree that vegans should eat B12-fortified foods or take a supplement.   The origin of the English term vegetarian is unknown.Rod Preece, Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought, University of British Columbia Press, 2008, p.&nbsp;12. The earliest known use is attributed to the actress Fanny Kemble, writing around 1839 in Georgia in the United States. The practice can be traced to Pythagoras in 6th-century-BCE Greece. Greek philosophers Empedocles and Theophrastus were vegetarians, as were Seneca the Younger, Ovid, Plutarch, Plotinus, Porphyry,Daniel A. Dombrowski, "Vegetarianism and the Argument from Marginal Cases in Porphyry", Journal of the History of Ideas, 45(1), January&nbsp;–March 1984, pp.&nbsp;141–143.  and the Arab poet Al-Maʿarri.D. S. Margoliouth, "Abu‘l-'Alā al- Ma‘arrī's Correspondence on Vegetarianism," The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 34(02), 1902 (pp.&nbsp;289–332), p.&nbsp;290.   Their arguments were based on health, the transmigration of souls, animal welfare and the view, espoused by Porphyry in De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium ("On Abstinence from Animal Food"), that if humans deserve justice so do nonhumans. Vegetarianism established itself as a significant movement in 19th-century England and the United States.James Gregory, Of Victorians and Vegetarians, I. B. Tauris, 2007. There were ovo-lacto vegetarians, who avoided meat but ate eggs and dairy; pescetarians, who in addition ate fish; and dietary vegans, then called strict vegetarians, who ate no meat, nor animal related products."Under Examination," The Dietetic Reformer and Vegetarian Messenger, Vol XI, 1884, p.&nbsp;237: "There are two kinds of Vegetarians&nbsp;– an extreme sect, who eat no animal food whatever; and a less extreme sect, who do not object to eggs, milk, or fish&nbsp;... The Vegetarian Society&nbsp;... belongs to the more moderate division." In 1813 the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley published "A Vindication of Natural Diet," advocating "abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors," and in 1815 William Lambe, a London physician, claimed that a vegan diet could cure a range of diseases from cancer and tuberculosis to acne.James C. Whorton, Crusaders for Fitness: The History of American Health Reformers, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014, pp.&nbsp;69–70. Percy Bysshe Shelley, A Vindication of Natural Diet, London: F. Pitman, 1884 [1813]. William Lambe, Joel Shew, Water and Vegetable Diet, New York: Fowler's and Wells, 1854 [London, 1815]. Sylvester Graham's meatless Graham diet&nbsp;– mostly fruit, vegetables, water, and bread made at home with stoneground flour&nbsp;– became popular as a supposed health remedy in the 1830s in the United States.Andrew F. Smith, Eating History, New York: Columbia University Press, 2013, pp.&nbsp;29–35 (p.&nbsp;33 for popularity); Whorton 2014, p.&nbsp;38ff. Several vegan communities were established. Amos Bronson Alcott, father of novelist Louisa May Alcott, opened the Temple School in 1834 and Fruitlands in 1844 in Massachusetts.Hart 1995, p.&nbsp;14; Richard Francis, Fruitlands: The Alcott Family and their Search for Utopia, Yale University Press, 2010. In 1838 William Alcott, Amos's cousin, published Vegetable Diet: As Sanctioned by Medical Men and By Experience in All Ages (1838); see William A. Alcott, Vegetable Diet: As Sanctioned by Medical Men and By Experience in All Ages, Boston: Marsh, Capen & Lyon, 1838; Vegetable Diet, New York: Fowlers and Wells, 1851. The word vegetarian appears in the second edition but not the first. In England in 1838 James Pierrepont Greaves founded the Concordium, a vegan community at Alcott House on Ham Common.Gregory 2007, p.&nbsp;22. In 1843 members of Alcott House created the British and Foreign Society for the Promotion of Humanity and Abstinence from Animal Food, led by Sophia Chichester.Jackie Latham, "The political and the personal: the radicalism of Sophia Chichester and Georgiana Fletcher Welch," Women's History Review, 8(3), 1999.  William E. A. Axon, "A Forerunner of the Vegetarian Society", Vegetarian Messenger, December 1893, pp.&nbsp;453–455. Alcott House helped establish the British Vegetarian Society, which held its first meeting in 1847 in Ramsgate, Kent.David Grumett, Rachel Muers, Theology on the Menu: Asceticism, Meat and Christian Diet, Routledge, 2010, p.&nbsp;64. An article in the society's magazine in 1851 discussing alternatives to shoe leather suggests the presence of vegans within the membership who rejected animal use entirely."History of Vegetarianism: The Origin of Some Words", International Vegetarian Union, 6 April 2010. The first known vegan cookbook, Rupert H. Wheldon's No Animal Food: Two Essays and 100 Recipes, was published in London in 1910.Leah Leneman, "No Animal Food: The Road to Veganism in Britain, 1909–1944",Society and Animals, 7(3), 1999 (pp.&nbsp;219–228), p.&nbsp;220. Rupert Wheldon, No Animal Food, New York and New Jersey: Health Culture Co., 1910.    During a visit to London in 1931, Mahatma Gandhi&nbsp;– who had joined the Vegetarian Society's executive committee when he lived in London from 1888 to 1891&nbsp;– gave a speech to the society arguing that it ought to promote a meat-free diet as a matter of ethics, not health.Mahatma Gandhi, "The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism", Vegetarian Society, London, 20 November 1931, pp.&nbsp;11–14.Stanley A. Wolpert, Gandhi's Passion: The Life and Legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, Oxford University Press, 2002, pp.&nbsp;21–22, 161. The consumption of eggs and dairy had become something of an issue within the society. There were regular discussions in its newsletter, the Vegetarian Messenger, about the treatment of cows and hens; it appears from the correspondence that many opponents of veganism came from within the vegetarian community.Leneman 1999, pp.&nbsp;222–223. In August 1944 several members asked that a section of the society's newsletter be devoted to non-dairy vegetarianism. When the request was turned down, Donald Watson, secretary of the Leicester Vegetarian Society, set up a new quarterly newsletter, Vegan News, in November 1944, priced tuppence. He chose the word vegan himself.George D. Rodger, "Interview with Donald Watson", Vegetarians in Paradise, 11 August 2004. George D. Rodger, "Interview with Donald Watson", recorded 15 December 2002 (abridged version later published in The Vegan). The first edition attracted over 100 letters, including from George Bernard Shaw, who resolved to give up eggs and dairy.Donald Watson, "The Early History of the Vegan Movement", The Vegan, Autumn 1965, pp.&nbsp;5–7. Donald Watson, Vegan News, first issue, November 1944. The six members of the new Vegan Society held their first meeting in early November at the Attic Club, 144 High Holborn, London. World Vegan Day is held every 1 November to mark the society's creation."World Vegan Day", Vegan Society, accessed 13 August 2009. Vegan News changed its name to The Vegan in November 1945, by which time it had 500 subscribers.The Vegan, 1(5), November 1945; for 500, The Vegan, 10(3), Autumn 1994, p.&nbsp;iv. It published recipes, health news and a "vegan trade list" of animal-free products such as Colgate toothpaste, Kiwi shoe polish, Dawson & Owen stationery and Gloy glue.For an example of the vegan trade list, The Vegan, 2(2), Summer 1946, pp.&nbsp;6–7. Vegan books appeared, including Vegan Recipes by Fay K. Henderson, and Aids to a Vegan Diet for Children by Kathleen V. Mayo.Joanne Stepaniak, The Vegan Sourcebook, McGraw Hill Professional, 2000, p.&nbsp;5; The Vegan, Autumn 1949, p.&nbsp;22. The Vegan Society soon clear that it rejected the use of animals for any purpose, not only as food, and in 1951 it defined veganism as "the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals."Leslie Cross, "Veganism Defined", The Vegetarian World Forum, 5(1), Spring 1951, pp.&nbsp;6–7.Matthew Cole, "'The greatest cause on earth': The historical formation of veganism as an ethical practice," in Nik Taylor, Richard Twine (eds.), The Rise of Critical Animal Studies: From the Margins to the Centre, Routledge, 2014 (pp.&nbsp;203–224), p.&nbsp;203. In 1956 Leslie Cross, the society's vice-president, founded the Plantmilk Society to explore commercial soy milk production. As Plantmilk Ltd (later Plamil Foods) it began production in 1965 of one of the first widely distributed soy milks in the Western world.Harry Maher, "The Milk of Human Kindness", interview with Arthur Ling, Vegan Views, 37, Autumn 1986; "C Arthur Ling, 1919–2005", Plamil Foods; "The Plantmilk Society", The Vegan, X(3), Winter 1956, pp.&nbsp;14–16. The first vegan society in the United States was founded in 1948 by Catherine Nimmo and Rubin Abramowitz in California, who distributed Watson's newsletter.Stepaniak 2000, pp.&nbsp;6–7; Linda Austin and Norm Hammond, Oceano, Arcadia Publishing, 2010, p.&nbsp;39; Freya Dinshah, "Vegan, More than a Dream", American Vegan, Summer 2010, p.&nbsp;31. In 1960 H. Jay Dinshah founded the American Vegan Society (AVS), linking veganism to the concept of ahimsa, "non-harming" in Sanskrit.Stepaniak 2000, pp.&nbsp;6–7; "American Vegan Society: History", American Vegan Society.Colin Spencer, "The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism", Fourth Estate Classic House, pp.&nbsp33–68, 69–84 According to Joanne Stepaniak, the word vegan was first published independently in 1962 by the Oxford Illustrated Dictionary, defined as "a vegetarian who eats no butter, eggs, cheese or milk."Stepaniak 2000, p.&nbsp;3. In the 1960s a countercultural food movement emerged in the United States around concerns about diet, the environment and a distrust of food producers, leading to increasing interest in organic gardening and vegetarianism.Andrew F. Smith, Eating History, New York: Columbia University Press, 2013, p.&nbsp;197; Wright 2015, p.&nbsp;34. Frances Moore Lappé's Diet for a Small Planet (1971) sold over three million copies and suggested "getting off the top of the food chain."Frances Moore Lappé, Diet for a Small Planet: How to Enjoy a Rich Protein Harvest by Getting Off the Top of the Food Chain, Friends of the Earth/Ballantine, 1971; Smith 2013, p.&nbsp;197. From the late 1970s a group of scientists in the US, including physicians Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn, Neal D. Barnard, John A. McDougall, Michael Greger and biochemist T. Colin Campbell, argued that diets based on animal fat and animal protein, such as the Western pattern diet, were detrimental to health.Donna Maurer, Vegetarianism: Movement or Moment?, Temple University Press, 2002, p.&nbsp;23 (for health professionals' interest in vegetarian diets in the last quarter of the 20th century), 99–101 (for Ornish and Barnard).

The following decades saw a series of books recommend vegan or vegetarian diets, including McDougall's The McDougall Plan (1983), John Robbins's Diet for a New America (1987), which associated meat eating with environmental damage, and Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease (1990).Iacobbo and Iacobbo 2006, p.&nbsp;75 (for MacDougall Plan); Wright 2015, p.&nbsp;35 (for Robbins); Maurer 2002, pp.&nbsp;99–101 (for Ornish). In 2003 two major North American dietitians' associations approved the vegan diet as safe for all life stages.Joan Sabaté, "The contribution of vegetarian diets to health and disease: a paradigm shift?", The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 78(3), September 2003, pp.&nbsp;502S–507S.

The interest was reflected in increased page views on Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia article on veganism was viewed 73,000 times in August 2009 but 145,000 times in August 2013. Articles on veganism were viewed more during this period than articles on vegetarianism in the English, French, German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish Wikipedias.Meat Atlas, Heinrich Böll Foundation, Friends of the Earth Europe, 2014, p.&nbsp;57; Mona Chalabi, "Meat atlas shows Latin America has become a soybean empire", The Guardian, 9 January 2014.

Joel Stein, "The Rise of the Power Vegans", Bloomberg Businessweek, 4 November 2010. The idea of the "flexi-vegan" gained currency; in his book VB6 (2013), New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman recommended sticking to a vegan diet before 6 pm. De Vegetarische Slager, the first known vegetarian butcher shop, selling mock meats, opened in the Netherlands in 2010.Michael Valraven, "Vegetarian butchers make a killing", Radio Netherlands Worldwide, 14 September 2011; De Vegetarische Slager, accessed 16 July 2014.

In the Netherlands there were an estimated 16,000 vegans as of 2007."Vegetarian in Holland: Shopping and Cooking", The Hague Online, 19 February 2014.    Vegans do not eat beef, pork, poultry, fowl, game or seafood, eggs, dairy or any other animal products. Dietary vegans might use animal products in clothing (as leather, wool and silk), toiletries and similar.Francione and Garner 2010, p.&nbsp;257. Ethical veganism extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical vegans reject the commodification of animals.Francione and Garner 2010, p.&nbsp;62. The British Vegan Society will certify a product only if it is free of animal involvement as far as possible and practical, including animal testing."Criteria for Vegan food", "Trademark Standards", Vegan Society; "What is Vegan?", American Vegan Society, accessed 17 December 2012. Philosopher Gary Steiner argues that it is not possible to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are "deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society."Gary Steiner, Animals and the Limits of Postmodernism, Columbia University Press, 2013, pp.&nbsp;127–128. Animal products in common use include albumen, allantoin, beeswax, blood, bone char, bone china, carmine, casein, cochineal, elastin, emu oil, gelatin, isinglass, keratin, lactic acid, lanolin, lard, rennet, retinol, shellac, squalene, tallow/sodium tallowate, whey and yellow grease. Some of these are chemical compounds which can be derived from animal products, from plants, or from petrochemicals. Allantoin, lactic acid, retinol and squalene, for example, can be vegan. However, these products and their origins are not always included in the list of ingredients."Animal ingredients and products", Vegan Peace; David L. Meeker (ed.), Essential Rendering: All About The Animal By-Products Industry, National Renderers Association, 2006. Ethical vegans will not buy woollen jumpers, silk scarves, leather shoes, bedding that contains goose down or duck feathers, ordinary soap (usually made of animal fat), or cosmetics that contain animal products. They avoid certain vaccines; the flu vaccine, for example, is usually grown in hens' eggs, although an effective alternative, Flublok, is widely available in the United States."Flublok Seasonal Influenza (Flu) Vaccine", Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Non-vegan items acquired before they became vegan might be donated to charity or used until worn out. Some vegan clothes, in particular leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage involved in their production.Stepaniak 2000, pp.&nbsp;20, 115–118, 154 (p.&nbsp;116 for environmental damage and petroleum-based products). The main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude eggs and dairy products. Ethical vegans avoid them on the premise that their production causes animal suffering and premature death. In egg production, most male chicks are culled because they do not lay eggs.S. Aerts, et al., "Culling of day-old chicks: opening the debates of Moria?" in Kate Millar, Pru Hobson West, Brigitte Nerlich (eds.), Ethical Futures: Bioscience and Food Horizons, Wageningen Academic Publishers, 2009, p.&nbsp;117; "Egg Production & Welfare", Vegetarian Society, accessed 17 December 2012. To obtain milk from dairy cattle, cows are made pregnant to induce lactation; they are kept pregnant and lactating for three to seven years, then slaughtered. Female calves are separated from their mothers within 24 hours of birth, and fed milk replacer to retain the cow's milk for human consumption. Male calves are slaughtered at birth, sent for veal production, or reared for beef.Lori Gruen, Ethics and Animals, Cambridge University Press, 2011, pp.&nbsp;85–86; Erik Marcus, Veganism: The New Ethics of Eating, McBooks Press, 2000, pp.&nbsp;128–129. Vegan groups disagree about insect products.Daniel Engber, "The Great Vegan Honey Debate: Is honey the dairy of the insect world?", Slate, 30 July 2008. Neither the Vegan Society nor the American Vegan Society considers honey, silk and other insect products as suitable for vegans,"Honey: Ain't so sweet for the bees", Vegan Society, accessed 16 December 2012; "What is Vegan?", American Vegan Society, accessed 16 December 2012. while Vegan Action and Vegan Outreach view it as a matter of personal choice."Is honey vegan?", Vegan Action, accessed 16 December 2012; "What about honey and silk?", Vegan Outreach, accessed 16 December 2012. Agave nectar is a popular vegan alternative to honey.Chloe Coscarelli, Chloe's Kitchen, Simon and Schuster, 2012, p.&nbsp;9. Vegan diets are based on grains and other seeds, legumes (particularly beans), fruits, vegetables, edible mushrooms,  and nuts.Reed Mangels, Virginia Messina and Mark Messina, The Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2011, p.&nbsp;7. Meat analogues (mock meats) based on soybeans (tofu), or wheat-based seitan/gluten, are a common source of plant protein, usually in the form of vegetarian sausage, mince and veggie burgers. Dishes based on soybeans are a staple of vegan diets because soybeans are a complete protein; this means they contain all the essential amino acids for humans and can be relied upon entirely for protein intake. They are consumed most often in the form of soy milk and tofu (bean curd), which is soy milk mixed with a coagulant. Tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm and extra firm for stews and stir-fries, to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts and shakes. Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh, seitan and texturized vegetable protein (TVP); also known as textured soy protein (TSP), the latter is often used in pasta sauces.Mangels, Messina and Messina, 2011, p.&nbsp;444. Plant milks—such as soy milk, almond milk, grain milks (oat milk and rice milk), hemp milk, and coconut milk—are used in place of cows' or goats' milk. Soy milk provides around 7 g of protein per cup (240 ml or 8 fluid ounces), compared with 8 g of protein per cup of cow's milk. Almond milk is lower in calories, carbohydrates and protein.Monica Reinagel, Nutrition Diva's Secrets for a Healthy Diet, Macmillan 2011, pp.&nbsp;20–21. Soy milk should not be used as a replacement for breast milk for babies. Babies who are not breastfed need commercial infant formula, normally based on cows' milk or soy. The latter is known as soy-based infant formula or SBIF.Reed Mangels, The Everything Vegan Pregnancy Book, Adams Media, 2011, p.&nbsp;174. Russell J. Merritt, Belinda H.

Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg replacer and Ener-G egg replacer, are available for cooking and baking.Caldwell Esselstyn, Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure, Penguin, 2007, p.&nbsp;266. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;445. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs.Coscarelli 2012, p.&nbsp;183. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used."Egg Replacements", People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.   Since 1991 the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) has recommended a no-cholesterol, low-fat vegan diet based on what they call the New Four Food Groups: fruit, legumes, grains and vegetables. Legumes include peas, beans, lentils and peanuts. PCRM recommends three or more servings a day of fruit (at least one of which is high in vitamin C, such as citrus fruit, melon or strawberries); two or more of protein-rich legumes (such as soybeans, which can be consumed as soy milk, tofu or tempeh); five or more of whole grains (such as corn, barley, rice and wheat, in products such as bread and tortillas); and four or more of vegetables (dark-green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, and dark-yellow and orange such as carrots or sweet potatoes)."The New Four Food Groups", Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, accessed 16 January 2013. The New Four Food Groups was created as an alternative to the Four Food Groups&nbsp;– meat, milk, vegetables and fruit, and cereal and breads&nbsp;– recommended by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) from 1956 until 1992.Marian Burros, "Eating Well; Rethink 4 Food Groups, Doctors Tell U.S.", The New York Times, 10 April 1991. In 1992 the USDA replaced this with the food guide pyramid and in 2011 with MyPlate, which is consistent with a vegan diet. MyPlate is divided into five groups: grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy (or calcium-fortified soymilk), and protein. The protein includes meat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts and seeds. In the UK the National Health Service recommends the Eatwell Plate, also with five groups and consistent with a vegan diet: fruit and vegetables; potatoes, bread and other starchy foods; dairy or non-dairy alternatives; meat, fish, eggs or beans for protein; and fat and sugar.   Proteins are composed of amino acids. Vegans obtain all their protein from plants, omnivores usually a third and ovo-lacto vegetarians half.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;71; for their chapter on protein, pp.&nbsp;65–79. Sources of plant protein include legumes such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, texturized vegetable protein, soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as quinoa (pronounced keenwa), brown rice, corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (the latter eaten as bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds. Combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids include rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, pp.&nbsp;72, 78. Soy beans and quinoa are known as complete proteins because they each contain all the essential amino acids in amounts that meet or exceed human requirements.M. Messina and V.

PMID 20622542 Mangels et al. write that consuming the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of protein (0.8 g/kg body weight) in the form of soy will meet the biologic requirement for amino acids. In 2012 the United States Department of Agriculture ruled that soy protein (tofu) may replace meat protein in the National School Lunch Program."Crediting Tofu and Soy Yogurt Products", USDA, 22 February 2012. The American Dietetic Association said in 2009 that a variety of plant foods consumed over the course of a day can provide all the essential amino acids for healthy adults, which means that protein combining in the same meal may not be necessary.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;75ff. Mangels et al. write that there is little reason to advise vegans to increase their protein intake, but erring on the side of caution, they recommend a 25 percent increase over the RDA for adults, to 1.0 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;77.   Vitamin B12 is a bacterial product needed for cell division, the formation and maturation of red blood cells, the synthesis of DNA, and normal nerve function. A deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia and nerve damage.Reed Mangels, Virginia Messina, and Mark Messina, "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)", The Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2011, pp.&nbsp;181–192. Vegans are unable in most cases to obtain B12 from their diet. Vegetarians are also at risk, as are older people and those with certain medical conditions.Roman Pawlak, et al., "The prevalence of cobalamin deficiency among vegetarians assessed by serum vitamin B12: a review of literature," European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 68(5), May 2014, pp.&nbsp;541–548.  PMID 24667752C. W. Wong, "Vitamin B12 deficiency in the elderly: is it worth screening?", Hong Kong Medical Journal, 21(2), April 2015, pp.&nbsp;155–164.  PMID 25756278 A 2013 study found that "vegetarians develop B12 depletion or deficiency regardless of demographic characteristics, place of residency, age, or type of vegetarian diet. Vegetarians should thus take preventive measures to ensure adequate intake of this vitamin, including regular consumption of supplements containing B12." Increased hygiene in the food supply is probably the cause of B12 depletion from plant-based diets.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;192. Neither plants nor animals make B12; it is produced by microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi and algae. Plants not washed properly may contain B12 from bacteria in the soil, often from faeces, and drinking water may be similarly contaminated, particularly in the developing world. Animals obtain it by eating contaminated plants, other animals, or their own faeces, and become sources of B12 if eaten themselves. Intensively farmed animals are often given B12 supplements or injections, particularly pigs and poultry, because when raised indoors they have no access to plants and less access to their own faeces.Lee Russell McDowell, Vitamins in Animal and Human Nutrition, John Wiley & Sons, 2008, p.&nbsp;555–556. Bacteria in the human digestive tract produce B12, but most is expelled in the faeces. The mouth is another source, but in small amounts and possibly analogue (not biologically active). Japanese researchers say that around 4 g of dried purple nori, an edible seaweed, supplies the adult RDA of 2.4 mcg (µg) of B12. Tempeh, a fermented soybean food, is cited as another source, perhaps because of contamination during production.Fumio Watanabe, et al., "Vitamin B12-Containing Plant Food Sources for Vegetarians", Nutrients, 6(5), 5 May 2014, pp.&nbsp;1861–1873.  PMID 24803097 Fumio Watanabe, et al., "Biologically active vitamin B12 compounds in foods for preventing deficiency among vegetarians and elderly subjects," Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry, 61(280), 17 July 2013, pp.&nbsp;6769–6775.

There is no gold standard for assessing B12 status and few studies exist of long-term vegans who have not used supplements or fortified foods.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, pp.&nbsp;182–183. Studies of vegans not taking supplements or eating fortified food have found low B12 levels and clinical signs of deficiency; low B12 levels without signs of a deficiency; and neither.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, pp.&nbsp;183–185.Timothy J. Key, Paul N. Appleby, Magdalena S. Rosell, "Health effects of vegetarian and vegan diet," Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 65(1), February 2006, pp.&nbsp;35–41.  PMID 16441942 Nevertheless, the consensus among researchers is that vegans and vegetarians should use supplements, or eat B12-fortified foods such as plant milk or breakfast cereal.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;181. Mangels et al. say: "It is likely that all Western vegans consuming unsupplemented diets will eventually develop vitamin B12 deficiency, although it may take decades for this to occur.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, pp.&nbsp;183. No animal products are involved in the production of B12 supplements.   Calcium is needed to maintain bone health and for several metabolic functions, including muscle function, vascular contraction and vasodilation, nerve transmission, intracellular signalling and hormonal secretion. Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth."Calcium", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health. The RDA for adults is 1,000&nbsp;mg for 19–50 years, 1,000&nbsp;mg for 51–70 years (men) and 1,200&nbsp;mg (women), and 1,200&nbsp;mg for 71+. The RDA for eighteen years and under is 200&nbsp;mg for 0–6 months, 260&nbsp;mg for 7–12 months, 700&nbsp;mg for 1–3 years, 1,000&nbsp;mg for 4–8 years, 1,300&nbsp;mg for 9–18 years. Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;109ff.Catherine A. Ross, et al. (eds.), "DRI Dietary Reference Intakes, Calcium, Vitamin D", Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D and Calcium, Institute of Medicine, 2011. Vegans are advised to eat three servings a day of a high-calcium food, such as fortified plant milk, fortified tofu, almonds or hazelnuts, and to take a supplement as necessary. Plant sources include broccoli, turnip, bok choy and kale; the bioavailability of calcium in spinach is poor. Vegans should make sure they consume enough vitamin D, which is needed for calcium absorption.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;110. A 2007 report based on the Oxford cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which began in 1993, suggested that vegans have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, likely because of lower dietary calcium intake. The study found that vegans consuming at least 525&nbsp;mg of calcium daily have a risk of fractures similar to that of other groups.A. Reed Mangels, "Bone nutrients for vegetarians", American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, July 2014, Supplement 1, pp.&nbsp;69S–765S.  PMID 24898231 A 2009 study found the bone mineral density (BMD) of vegans was 94 percent that of omnivores, but deemed the difference clinically insignificant.L. T. Ho-Pham et al., "Effect of vegetarian diets on bone mineral density: a Bayesian meta-analysis", American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 90(4), October 2009, pp.&nbsp;943–950.  PMID 19571226   Vitamin D (calciferol) is needed for several functions, including calcium absorption, enabling mineralization of bone, and bone growth. Without it bones can become thin and brittle; together with calcium it offers protection against osteoporosis. Vitamin D is produced in the body when ultraviolet rays from the sun hit the skin; outdoor exposure is needed because UVB radiation does not penetrate glass. It is present in salmon, tuna, mackerel and cod liver oil, with small amounts in cheese, egg yolks and beef liver, and in some mushrooms."Vitamin D", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health; Mangels et al. 2011, pp.&nbsp;204–209; Ross et al. (Institute of Medicine) 2011, pp.&nbsp;75–124. Most vegan diets contain little or no vitamin D without fortified food. People with little sun exposure may need supplements. The extent to which sun exposure is sufficient depends on the season, time of day, cloud and smog cover, skin melanin content, and whether sunscreen is worn. According to the National Institutes of Health, most people can obtain and store sufficient vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer and fall, even in the far north. They report that some researchers recommend 5–30 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen between 10 am and 3 pm, at least twice a week. Tanning beds emitting 2–6 per cent UVB radiation have a similar effect, though tanning is inadvisable.Mangels et al. 2011, pp.&nbsp;207–208; "Vitamin D: Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin D", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health. Vitamin D comes in two forms. Cholecalciferol (D3) is synthesized in the skin after exposure to the sun, or consumed in the form of animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from lanolin in sheep's wool. Ergocalciferol (D2) is derived from ergosterol from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms may or may not be bioequivalent.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp; 209. According to researchers from the Institute of Medicine, the differences between D2 and D3 do not affect metabolism, both function as prohormones, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.Ross et al. (Institute of Medicine) 2011, p.&nbsp;75.   Vegetarian and vegan diets usually contain as much iron as animal-based diets, or more. Vegan diets generally contain more iron than vegetarian diets because dairy products contain very little. There are concerns about the bioavailability of iron from plant foods, assumed by some researchers to be 5–15 percent compared to 18 percent from a nonvegetarian diet.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, pp.&nbsp;138ff, 143–144. For a detailed discussion, "Iron", Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academy Press, 2001, pp.&nbsp;290–393. Iron deficiency anaemia is found as often in nonvegetarians as in vegetarians, though studies have shown vegetarians' iron stores to be lower.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;146. Mangels et al. write that, because of the lower bioavailability of iron from plant sources, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences established a separate RDA for vegetarians and vegans of 14&nbsp;mg for vegetarian men and postmenopausal women, and 33&nbsp;mg for premenopausal women not using oral contraceptives.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;143. Supplements should be used with caution after consulting a physician, because iron can accumulate in the body and cause damage to organs. This is particularly true of anyone with hemochromatosis, a relatively common condition that can remain undiagnosed."Iron: Health Risks from Excessive Iron", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health. High-iron vegan foods include soy beans, black-strap molasses, black beans, lentils, chickpeas, spinach, tempeh, tofu and lima beans.Davida Gypsy Breier, Reed Mangels, Vegan & Vegetarian FAQ, The Vegetarian Resource Group, 2001, p.&nbsp;27. Iron absorption can be enhanced by eating a source of vitamin C at the same time,Tom A. Sanders, "The nutritional adequacy of plant-based diets", The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 58(2), 1999, pp.&nbsp;265–269.  PMID 10466165 such as half a cup of cauliflower or five fluid ounces of orange juice. Coffee and some herbal teas can inhibit iron absorption, as can spices that contain tannins (turmeric, coriander, chillies and tamarind).Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p.&nbsp;142; Reed Mangels, "Iron in the Vegan Diet", The Vegetarian Resources Group. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is found in leafy green vegetables and nuts, and in vegetable oils such as canola and flaxseed oil."Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Health", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health. The Adequate Intake for ALA is 1.1–1.6 g/day. Vegan Outreach suggests vegans take 1/4 teaspoon of flaxseed oil (also known as linseed oil) daily, and use oils containing low amounts of omega-6 fatty acids, such as olive, canola, avocado or peanut oil.Jack Norris, "Omega-3 Fatty Acid Recommendations for Vegetarians", Vegan Outreach, accessed 4 February 2011. Iodine supplementation may be necessary for vegans in countries where salt is not typically iodized, where it is iodized at low levels, or where, as in Britain and Ireland, dairy products are relied upon for iodine delivery because of low levels in the soil.Paul N. Appleby, et al., "The Oxford Vegetarian Study: an overview", American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 70(3), September 1999, pp.&nbsp;525S–531S. Iodine can be obtained from most vegan multivitamins or regular consumption of seaweeds, such as kelp.H. J. Lightowler, G. J. Davies, M. D. Trevan, "Iodine in the diet: Perspectives for vegans", Journal of the Royal Society of Health, 116(1), February 1996, pp.&nbsp;14–20.  PMID 8683536"Iodine", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health. The RDA is 110 mcg (0–six months), 130 mcg (7–12 months), 90 mcg (1–8 years), 120 mcg (9–13 years), 150 mcg (14+). The RDA for pregnancy and lactation is 220 and 290 mcg respectively.   Veganism appears to provide health benefits, including a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and heart disease.Note: several sources use the word vegetarian to refer to a vegan or entirely plant-based diet: Marian Glick-Bauer, Ming-Chin Yeh, "The Health Advantage of a Vegan Diet: Exploring the Gut Microbiota Connection", Nutrients, 6(11), November 2014, pp.&nbsp;4822–4838.

Beyond meatless diets, further avoidance of eggs and dairy products may offer a mild additional benefit.

In general, the protective effects of vegetarian diets are stronger in men than in women."  PMID 24871675 Philip J. Tuso, et al., "Nutritional Update for Physicians: Plant-Based Diets", The Permanente Journal, 17(2), Spring 2013, pp.&nbsp;61–66: "The major benefits for patients who decide to start a plant-based diet [vegetarian or vegan] are the possibility of reducing the number of medications they take to treat a variety of chronic conditions, lower body weight, decreased risk of cancer, and a reduction in their risk of death from ischemic heart disease."

PMID 24898223 According to nutritionist Winston Craig, writing in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2009, vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fibre, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals, and lower in calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12. Craig wrote that vegans tend to be thinner, with lower serum cholesterol and lower blood pressure. Factors associated with a vegan diet being considered cancer-protective include an increased intake of fruits and vegetables; absence of meat; sources of vegan protein, including soy protein; and typically lower body mass index (BMI). Eliminating all animal products increases the risk of deficiencies of vitamins B12 and D, calcium and omega-3 fatty acids. Craig advised vegans to eat fortified foods or take supplements, and warned that iron and zinc may be problematic because of limited bioavailability. Vegans might be at risk of low bone mineral density without supplements. The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada state that properly planned vegan diets are appropriate for all life stages, including pregnancy and lactation. They indicate that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders, but that its adoption may serve to camouflage a disorder rather than cause one. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well-planned vegan diet as viable for any age."Position of the American Dietetic Association: vegetarian diets", Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 109(7), July 2009, pp.&nbsp;1266–1282: "It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.

Animal ingredients are ubiquitous because they are cheap. After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers are put through the rendering process, and some of that material, particularly the fat, ends up in toiletries. Common ingredients include tallow in soap, and glycerine (derived from collagen), used as a lubricant and humectant in haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foam, soap and toothpaste; there is a plant-based form but it is usually animal-based. Lanolin from sheep's wool is found in lip balm and moisturizers. Stearic acid is a common ingredient in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos; as with glycerine, it can be plant-based but is usually animal-derived. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid derived from animal milk, is used in moisturizers, as is allantoin, from the comfrey plant or cows' urine, in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste.Animal Ingredients A to Z, E.

Carmine from scale insects, such as the female cochineal, is used in food and cosmetics to produce red and pink shades.Rosie Mestel, "Cochineal and Starbucks: Actually, this dye is everywhere", Los Angeles Times, 20 April 2012; Raymond Eller Kirk, Donald Frederick Othmer, Kirk-Othmer Chemical Technology of Cosmetics, John Wiley & Sons, 2012, p.&nbsp;535. The British Vegan Society's sunflower logo and PETA's bunny logo mean the product is certified vegan, which includes no animal testing. The leaping-bunny logo signals no animal testing, but it might not be vegan.Messina 2013, pp.&nbsp;232–233; Aexis Croswell, "How to Read a Cruelty-Free Cosmetics Label", One Green Planet, 5 February 2014; "Certify", Vegan Action; FAQ, Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics. The Vegan Society criteria for vegan certification are that the product contain no animal products, and that neither the finished item nor its ingredients have been tested on animals by, or on behalf of, the manufacturer or by anyone over whom the manufacturer has control. Its website contains a list of certified products,"Trademark Standards" and Trademark search, British Vegan Society. as does Australia's Choose Cruelty Free website."Accredited Cruelty-Free Vegan Companies", Choose Cruelty Free. Animal Ingredients A to Z (2004) and Veganissimo A to Z (2013) list which ingredients might be animal-derived. Beauty Without Cruelty, founded as a charity in 1959, was one of the earliest manufacturers and certifiers of vegan toiletries.Linzey, Andrew. "Dowding, Lady Muriel," Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare. Greenwood, 1998, p.&nbsp;139; "History", Beauty Without Cruelty. Several international companies stock large vegan ranges, including Kiss My Face, MuLondon and Lush.Britanny Helmrich, "13 Cool Vegan-Friendly Businesses That Inspire", Business New Daily, 10 June 2015; "Why aren't all your products vegan?", FAQ, Lush. Virginia Messina, Vegan for Her, Da Capo Press, 2013, p.&nbsp;233. Ethical vegans avoid clothing that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere and angora), fur, feathers, or leather, snakeskin, or any other kind of skin or product. Most leather clothing is made from cows' and calves' skins, but sheep, goats, horses and pigs are also used. Less common skins include those from kangaroos, elephants, zebras, seals, crocodile and deer. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry.Stepaniak 2000, p.&nbsp;115. They wear shoes, belts, jackets and carry handbags made of hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, synthetic leather (known as pleather), rubber or vinyl. Manufacture of the petroleum-based materials is harmful to the environment.Stepianak 2000, p.&nbsp;16; Messina 2013, p.&nbsp;231.   Ethical veganism is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of species membership alone. Divisions within animal rights theory include rights-based (deontological) and utilitarian (consequentialist) approaches, as well as protectionism, which pursues improved conditions for animals, and abolitionism, which seeks to end human ownership of non-humans. Abolitionists argue that protectionism serves only to make the public feel that animal use can be morally unproblematic (the "happy meat" position). Rights-theorists tend to be abolitionist and utilitarians protectionist.Francione and Garner 2010, pp.&nbsp;71–72.Gary Francione, Animals as Persons, Columbia University Press, 2013, p.&nbsp;150; Erik Marcus "Erik Marcus Debates Professor Francione on Abolition vs. Animal Welfare", Erik's Diner, 25 February 2007. Law professor Gary Francione, a rights theorist and prominent abolitionist, argues that all sentient beings should have the right not to be treated as property, and that adopting veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non-humans have intrinsic moral value.Francione and Garner 2010, p.&nbsp;62ff. Pursuing improved welfare conditions is like campaigning for "conscientious rapists" who will rape without beating, he argues. Philosopher Tom Regan, also a rights theorist, argues that animals possess value as "subjects-of-a-life," because they have beliefs, desires, memory and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals. The right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden by other moral principles, but pleasure, convenience and the economic interests of farmers are not weighty enough.Tom Regan, The Case for Animal Rights, University of California Press, 1983, pp.&nbsp;243, 333–339. Philosopher Peter Singer, a prominent protectionist and utilitarian, argues that there is no moral or logical justification for failing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making decisions, and that killing animals should be rejected unless necessary for survival.Peter Singer, Practical Ethics, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p.&nbsp;50; Singer 1999, pp.&nbsp;60–61. Despite this, he writes that "[e]thical thinking can be sensitive to circumstances," and that he is "not too concerned about trival infractions."Peter Singer and Jim Mason, The Way We Eat, Rodale, 2006, pp.&nbsp;281–282. An argument proposed by Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because it focuses on personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can.Bruce Friedrich, "Personal Purity vs. Effective Advocacy", PETA, 2006. For Francione, this is similar to arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms.Francione and Garner 2010, pp.&nbsp;72–73. Another view is that ethical veganism remains "subtly human-centred." Philosopher Val Plumwood saw ethical veganism, which she called "Ontological Veganism," as an example of human/nature dualism in that it views humanity as separate from the rest of nature; ethical vegans want to admit non-humans into the category that deserves special protection, rather than recognize the "ecological embeddedness" of all.Val Plumwood, "Gender, Eco-Feminism and the Environment," in Robert White (ed.), Controversies in Environmental Sociology, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;52–53. Plumwood maintained that animal food may be an "unnecessary evil" from the perspective of the consumer who "draws on the whole planet for nutritional needs," and she strongly opposed factory farming, but for anyone relying on a much smaller ecosystem, it is very difficult or impossible to be vegan, she argued.Val Plumwood, The Eye of the Crocodile, edited by Lorraine Shannon, Canberra: Australian National University E Press, 2012, p.&nbsp;87.   Environmental vegans focus on conservation, rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing, hunting, trapping and farming, particularly factory farming, are environmentally unsustainable. Around 30 percent of the planet's surface is devoted to the livestock sector. In the United States ten billion land animals are killed every year for human consumption, and in 2005 48 billion birds were killed globally.Henning Steinfeld, et al., Livestock's Long Shadow, Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations, 2006, p.&nbsp;132. A 2006 UN report, Livestock's Long Shadow, concluded that livestock farming (mostly of cows, chickens and pigs) has an impact on the air, land, soil, water, biodiversity and climate change.Steinfeld et al. 2006, pp.&nbsp;3, 74. Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society called pigs and chicken "major aquatic predators," and said that all Sea Shepherd ships are vegan for environmental reasons. In 1999 222 million tonnes of meat were produced globally.Steinfeld et al. 2006, p.&nbsp;xx. Livestock consumed 1,174 million tonnes of food in 2002, including 7.6 million tonnes of fishmeal and 670 million tonnes of cereals, one-third of the global cereal harvest.Steinfeld et al. 2006, p.&nbsp;12. In 2001 they consumed 45 million tonnes of roots and vegetables and 17 million tonnes of pulses.Steinfeld et al. 2006, p.&nbsp;42. The roots, vegetables and pulses are mostly cassava, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cabbage, plantain, peas and beans. As of 2006 the livestock industry accounted for 9 percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, 37 percent of methane, 65 percent of nitrous oxide, and 68 percent of ammonia; livestock waste emitted 30 million tonnes of ammonia a year, which is involved in the production of acid rain.Steinfeld et al. 2006, p.&nbsp;272."Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks: 1990–2009", United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2011. Greenhouse gas emissions are not limited to animal husbandry. Plant agriculture such as rice cultivation can also cause environmental problems.Heinz-Ulrich Neue, "Methane emission from rice fields", BioScience, 43(7), 1993, pp.&nbsp;466–473; Tim Hirsch, "Plants revealed as methane source", BBC News, 11 January 2006. A 2007 Cornell University study concluded that vegetarian diets use the least land per capita, but require higher quality land than is needed to feed animals.Christian J. Peters, Jennifer Wilkins, Gary W. Ficka, "Testing a complete-diet model for estimating the land resource requirements of food consumption and agricultural carrying capacity: The New York State example", Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems, 22(2), June 2007, pp.&nbsp;145–153.  Susan Lang, "Diet for small planet may be most efficient if it includes dairy and a little meat, Cornell researchers report", Cornell Chronicle, Cornell University, 4 October 2007. A 2010 UN report, Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production, argued that animal products "in general require more resources and cause higher emissions than plant-based alternatives."Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production, International Panel for Resource Management, United Nations Environment Programme, June 2010. It argued that a move away from animal products is needed to reduce environmental damage.Felicity Carus, "UN urges global move to meat and dairy-free diet", The Guardian, 2 June 2010; "Energy and Agriculture Top Resource Panel's Priority List for Sustainable 21st Century", United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Brussels, 2 June 2010. For an opposing position, Simon Fairlie, Meat: A Benign Extravagance, Chelsea Green Publishing, 2010. Steven Davis, a professor of animal science, argued in 2003 that, applying the least-harm principle, human beings should convert to a ruminant-based rather than plant-based diet, because of the animals killed by crop production. Based on a finding that wood-mouse populations fell from 25 to five per hectare after harvest, Davis estimated that 10 animals per hectare are killed from crop farming every year. If all  of cropland in the continental United States were used for a vegan diet, 500 million animals would die, but if half the land were used for ruminant pasture the number would be 900,000. This assumes that people switch to beef, lamb and dairy products from the eight billion poultry killed each year.S. L. Davis, "The Least Harm Principle May Require That Humans Consume a Diet Containing Large Herbivores, Not a Vegan Diet," Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics, 16(4), 2003, pp.&nbsp;387–394 (courtesy link); also see George Schedler, "Does Ethical Meat Eating Maximize Utility?" Social Theory and Practice, 31(4), 2005, pp.&nbsp;499–511.  S. L. Davis, "What is the Morally Relevant Difference between the Mouse and the Pig?", Proceedings of EurSafe 2000, 2nd Congress of the European Society for Agricultural and Food Ethics, 2000, pp.&nbsp;107–109. Philosopher Andy Lamey argued that, to include nonhuman deaths in the moral cost of veganism, Davis must also include human deaths caused by his proposed diet.Andy Lamey, "Food Fight! Davis versus Regan on the Ethics of Eating Beef", Journal of Social Philosophy, 38(2), Summer 2007 (pp.&nbsp;331–348), pp.&nbsp;340–341 (courtesy link).  Economist Gaverick Matheny wrote that Davis had miscalculated the animal deaths, basing his figures on land area rather than per consumer. In addition, by focusing on numbers rather than welfare, and by excluding factory-farmed animals, Davis had equated lives with lives worth living. His argument ignored the harm done to farmed animals: pain from branding, dehorning and castration, confinement, transport without food or water to a slaughterhouse, and a frightening death. Matheny argued that (strict) vegetarianism probably allows for a greater number of animals with lives worth living.Gaverick Matheny, "Least Harm: A Defense of Vegetarianism from Steven Davis's Omnivorous Proposal," Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics, 16(5), 2003, pp.&nbsp;505–511 (courtesy link). Matheny uses the terms vegetarianism, strictly vegetarian (vegan), and vegan-vegetarian to refer to dietary veganism.
