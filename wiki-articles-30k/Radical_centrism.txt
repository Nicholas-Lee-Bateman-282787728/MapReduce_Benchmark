   The terms radical centrism, radical center (or radical centre), and radical middle refer to a political philosophy that arose in the Western nations, predominantly the United States and the United Kingdom, in the late 20th century. At first it was defined in a variety of ways, but at the beginning of the 21st century a number of texts and think tanks gave the philosophy a more developed cast.Olson, Robert (January–February 2005). "The Rise of 'Radical Middle' Politics". The Futurist, vol. 39, no. 1, pp. 45–47. Publication of the World Future Society. Retrieved 7 February 2013.Tanenhaus, Sam (14 April 2010). "The Radical Center: The History of an Idea". The New York Times Book Review. Retrieved 7 February 2013. The "radical" in the term refers to a willingness on the part of most radical centrists to call for fundamental reform of institutions.Halstead, Ted; Lind, Michael (2001). The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics. Doubleday / Random House, p. 16. ISBN 978-0-385-50045-6. The "centrism" refers to a belief that genuine solutions require realism and pragmatism, not just idealism and emotion.Avlon, John (2004). Independent Nation: How the Vital Center Is Changing American Politics. Harmony Books / Random House, p. 2. ISBN 978-1-4000-5023-9. Thus one radical centrist text defines radical centrism as "idealism without illusions".Satin, Mark (2004). Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now. Westview Press and Basic Books, p. 5. ISBN 978-0-8133-4190-3. Most radical centrists borrow what they see as good ideas from left, right, and wherever else they may be found, often melding them together. Most support market-based solutions to social problems with strong governmental oversight in the public interest.Miller, Matthew (2003). The Two Percent Solution: Fixing America's Problems in Ways Liberals and Conservatives Can Love. Public Affairs / Perseus Books Group. p. 71. ISBN 978-1-58648-158-2. There is support for increased global engagement and the growth of an empowered middle class in developing countries.Halstead, Ted, ed.(2004). The Real State of the Union: From the Best Minds in America, Bold Solutions to the Problems Politicians Dare Not Address. Basic Books, Chaps. 27–31. ISBN 978-0-465-05052-9. Many radical centrists work within the major political parties, but also support independent or third-party initiatives and candidacies.Avlon (2004), Part 4. Criticism of radical centrist policies and strategies has mounted as the political philosophy has developed. One common criticism is that radical centrist policies are only marginally different from conventional centrist policies.Marx, Greg (25 July 2011). "Tom Friedman's 'Radical' Wrongness". Columbia Journalism Review. Retrieved 1 February 2013. Another criticism is that the radical centrist penchant for third parties is naive and self-defeating. Some observers see radical centrism as primarily a process of catalyzing dialogue and fresh thinking among polarized people and groups. Some influences on radical centrist political philosophy are not directly political. Robert C. Solomon, a philosopher with radical-centrist interests,Solomon, Robert C. (2003). A Better Way to Think About Business: How Personal Integrity Leads to Corporate Success. Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-538315-7. identifies a number of philosophical concepts supporting balance, reconciliation, or synthesis, including Confucius's concept of ren, Aristotle's concept of the mean, Erasmus's and Montaigne's humanism, Vico's evolutionary vision of history, William James's and John Dewey's pragmatism, and Aurobindo Ghose's integration of opposites.Solomon Robert C. Higgins, Kathleen M. (1996). A Short History of Philosophy. Oxford University Press, pp. 93, 66, 161, 179, 222, 240, and 298. ISBN 978-0-19-510-196-6. However, most commonly cited influences and precursors are from the political realm. For example, British radical-centrist politician Nick Clegg considers himself an heir to political theorist John Stuart Mill, former Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George, economist John Maynard Keynes, social reformer William Beveridge, and former Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond.Stratton, Allegra; Wintour, Patrick (13 March 2011).

In his book Independent Nation (2004), John Avlon discusses precursors of 21st-century U.S. political centrism, including President Theodore Roosevelt, Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, and African-American Senator Edward W. Brooke.Avlon, John (2004), pp. 26, 173, 223, 244, and 257. Radical centrist writer Mark Satin points to political influences from outside the electoral arena, including communitarian thinker Amitai Etzioni, magazine publisher Charles Peters, management theorist Peter Drucker, city planning theorist Jane Jacobs, and futurists Heidi and Alvin Toffler.Satin (2004), pp. 10, 23, and 30 Satin calls Benjamin Franklin the radical middle's favorite Founding Father since he was "extraordinarily practical", "extraordinarily creative", and managed to "get the warring factions and wounded egos [at the U.S. Constitutional Convention] to transcend their differences".Satin (2004), p. 22. One of the first uses of the term "radical middle" in a political context came in 1962, when cartoonist Jules Feiffer employed it to mock what he saw as the timid and pretentious outlook of the American political class.Feiffer, Jules (21 January 1962). "We've All Heard of the Radical Right and the Radical Left ... ". Library of Congress website. Retrieved 1 February 2013.Feiffer, Jules (2010). Backing into Forward: A Memoir. Nan A. Talese / Doubleday, p. 345. ISBN 978-0-385-53158-0. One of the first people to develop a positive definition was Renata Adler, a staff writer for The New Yorker. In the introduction to her second collection of essays, Toward a Radical Middle (1969), she presented radical centrism as a healing radicalism.Adler, Renata (1969). Toward a Radical Middle: Fourteen Pieces of Reporting and Criticism. Random House, pp. xiii–xxiv. ISBN 978-0-394-44916-6. It rejected the violent posturing and rhetoric of the 1960s, she said, in favor of such "corny" values as "reason, decency, prosperity, human dignity, [and human] contact".Adler (1969), p. xxiii. She called for the "reconciliation" of the white working class and African-Americans. In the 1970s, sociologist Donald I. Warren described the radical center as consisting of those "middle American radicals" who were suspicious of big government, the national media, and academics, as well as rich people and predatory corporations. Although they might vote for Democrats or Republicans, or for populists like George Wallace, they felt politically homeless and were looking for leaders who would address their concerns.Warren, Donald I. (1976). The Radical Center: Middle Americans and the Politics of Alienation. University of Notre Dame Press, Chap. 1. ISBN 978-0-268-01594-7. In the 1980s and 1990s, several authors contributed their understandings to the concept of the radical center. For example, futurist Marilyn Ferguson added a holistic dimension to the concept when she said, "[The] Radical Center ... is not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road".Ferguson, Marilyn (1980). The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980s. J. P. Tarcher Inc. / Houghton Mifflin, pp. 228–29. ISBN 978-0-87477-191-6. Sociologist Alan Wolfe located the creative part of the political spectrum at the center: "The extremes of right and left know where they stand, while the center furnishes what is original and unexpected."Wolfe, Alan (1996). Marginalized in the Middle. University of Chicago Press, p. 16. ISBN 978-0-226-90516-7. African-American theorist Stanley Crouch upset many political thinkers when he pronounced himself a "radical pragmatist".Author unidentified (30 January 1995). "The 100 Smartest New Yorkers". New York Magazine, vol. 28, no. 5, p. 41. He explained, "I affirm whatever I think has the best chance of working, of being both inspirational and unsentimental, of reasoning across the categories of false division and beyond the decoy of race".Crouch, Stanley (1995). The All-American Skin Game; or, The Decoy of Race. Pantheon Books. ISBN 978-0-679-44202-8. In the 1990s, political independents Jesse Ventura, Angus King, and Lowell Weicker became governors of American states. According to John Avlon, they pioneered the combination of fiscal prudence and social tolerance that has served as a model for radical centrist governance ever since. They also developed a characteristic style, a combination of "common sense and maverick appeal".Avlon (2004), p. 277. In his influentialSatin (2004), p. 10. 1995 Newsweek cover story, "Stalking the Radical Middle", journalist Joe Klein described radical centrists as angrier and more frustrated than conventional Democrats and Republicans. He said they share four broad goals: getting money out of politics, balancing the budget, restoring civility, and figuring out how to run government better. He also said their concerns were fueling "what is becoming a significant intellectual movement, nothing less than an attempt to replace the traditional notions of liberalism and conservatism".Klein, Joe (24 September 1995).

In 1998, British sociologist Anthony Giddens claimed that the radical center is synonymous with the Third Way.Giddens, Anthony (1998). The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy. Polity Press, pp. 44–46. ISBN 978-0-7456-2267-5. For Giddens, an advisor to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and for many other European political actors, the Third Way is a reconstituted form of social democracy.Giddens, Anthony (2000). The Third Way and Its Critics. Polity Press, Chap. 2 ("Social Democracy and the Third Way"). ISBN 978-0-7456-2450-1. Some radical centrist thinkers do not equate radical centrism with the Third Way. In Britain, many do not see themselves as social democrats. Most prominently, British radical-centrist politician Nick Clegg has made it clear he does not consider himself an heir to Tony Blair, and Richard Reeves, Clegg's longtime advisor, emphatically rejects social democracy.Reeves, Richard (19 September 2012). "The Case for a Truly Liberal Party". The New Statesman, p. 26. Retrieved 7 January 2013. In the United States, the situation is different because the term Third Way was adopted by the Democratic Leadership Council and other moderate Democrats.Smith, Ben (7 February 2011). "The End of the Democratic Leadership Council Era". Politico website. Retrieved 2 February 2013. However, most U.S. radical centrists also avoid the term. Ted Halstead and Michael Lind's introduction to radical centrist politics fails to mention it,Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 263. and Lind subsequently accused the organized moderate Democrats of siding with the "center-right" and Wall Street. Radical centrists have expressed dismay with what they see as "split[ting] the difference", "triangulation",Burns, James MacGregor; Sorenson, Georgia J. (1999). Dead Center: Clinton-Gore Leadership and the Perils of Moderation. Scribner, p. 221.

The first years of the 21st century saw publication of four introductions to radical centrist politics: Ted Halstead and Michael Lind's The Radical Center (2001), Matthew Miller's The Two Percent Solution (2003), John Avlon's Independent Nation (2004), and Mark Satin's Radical Middle (2004).Satin (2004), p. 10 (citing "big-picture introductions" by Halstead-Lind and Miller).Wall, Wendy L.

These books attempted to take the concept of radical centrism beyond the stage of "cautious gestures"Avlon (2004), p. 3. and journalistic observation and define it as a political philosophy. The authors came to their task from diverse political backgrounds: Avlon had been a speechwriter for New York Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani;Avlon (2004), pp. 378–79. Miller had been a business consultant before serving in President Bill Clinton's budget office;Miller (2003), p. xiv. Lind had been an exponent of Harry Truman-style "national liberalism";Lind, Michael (1996). Up from Conservatism: Why the Right Is Wrong for America. Free Press / Simon & Schuster, p. 259. ISBN 978-0-684-83186-2. Halstead had run a think tank called Redefining Progress; and Satin had co-drafted the U.S. Green Party's foundational political statement, "Ten Key Values".Gaard, Greta (1998). Ecological Politics: Ecofeminism and the Greens. Temple University Press, pp. 142–43. ISBN 978-1-56639-569-4. There is, however, a generational bond: all these authors were between 31 and 41 years of age when their books were published (except for Satin, who was nearing 60). While the four books do not speak with one voice, among them they express assumptions, analyses, policies, and strategies that helped set the parameters for radical centrism as a 21st-century political philosophy: Along with publication of the four overviews of radical centrist politics, the first part of the 21st century saw a rise in the creation and dissemination of radical centrist policy ideas. Several think tanks are developing radical centrist ideas more thoroughly than was done in the overview books. Among them are Demos, in Britain; the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership, in Australia; and the New America Foundation, in the United States. The New America Foundation was started by authors Ted Halstead and Michael Lind, and two others, to bring radical centrist ideas to Washington, D.C. journalists and policy researchers. A radical centrist perspective can also be found in major periodicals. In the United States, for example, The Washington Monthly was started by early radical centrist thinker Charles Peters,Satin (2004), pp. 22–23 ("Franklin to Peters to You").Carlson, Peter (30 April 2001).

Matthew Miller acknowledges that Perot had enough principle to support a gasoline tax hike,Miller (2003), p. 187. Halstead and Lind note that he popularized the idea of balancing the budget,Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 115. and John Avlon says he crystallized popular distrust of partisan extremes.Avlon (2004), p. 284. But none of those authors examines Perot's ideas or campaigns in depth, and Mark Satin does not mention Perot at all. Joe Klein mocks one of Perot's campaign gaffes and says he was not a sufficiently substantial figure. Miller characterizes Perot as a rich, self-financed lone wolf.Miller (2003), p. 178.

By the decade of the 2010s, radical centrists were engaged in a variety of actions in the English-speaking nations: Following the 2010 election, Nick Clegg, then leader of the Liberal Democrats (Britain's then third party), had his party enter into a Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement to form a majority government.Author unidentified (12 May 2011).

Our opponents try to divide us with their outdated labels of left and right. But we are not on the left and we are not on the right. We have our own label: Liberal.

After spending time with a variety of radical centrists, journalist Alec MacGillis concluded that their perspectives are so disparate that they could never come together to build a viable political organization.MacGillis, Alec (2 November 2011). "Beware: 'Radical Centrists' On the March!". The New Republic. Retrieved 5 February 2011. Some radical centrists are less than sanguine about their future. One concern is co-optation. For example, Michael Lind worries that the enthusiasm for the term radical center, on the part of "arbiters of the conventional wisdom", may signal a weakening of the radical vision implied by the term. Another concern is passion. John Avlon fears that some centrists cannot resist the lure of passionate partisans, whom he calls "wingnuts".Avlon, John (2010). Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America. Beast Books / Perseus Books Group, pp. 1–3 and 238–39. ISBN 978-0-9842951-1-1. By contrast, Mark Satin worries that radical centrism, while "thoroughly sensible", lacks an "animating passion" – and claims there has never been a successful political movement without one.Satin, Mark (fall 2002). "Where's the Juice?". The Responsive Community, vol. 12, no. 4, pp. 74–75. Retrieved 5 February 2013. Some radical centrists, such as mediator Mark GerzonSatin (2004), p. 27. and activist Joseph F. McCormick, see radical centrism as primarily a commitment to process.Gerzon, Mark (2006). Leading Through Conflict: How Successful Leaders Transform Differences into Opportunity. Harvard Business School Press, pp. 4–8. ISBN 978-1-59139-919-3. Their approach is to facilitate processes of structured dialogue among polarized people and groups, from the neighborhood level on up.Gerzon (2006, Chaps. 9–10. A major goal is to enable dialogue participants to come up with new perspectives and solutions that can address every party's core interests.Gerzon (2006), Chap. 11. Both ecologist Gary Nabhan and Onward Christian Athletes author Tom Krattenmaker speak of the radical center as that (metaphoric) space where such dialogue and innovation can occur.Krattenmaker, Tom (27 December 2012).

The city of Portland, Oregon, has been characterized as "radical middle" in USA Today newspaper because many formerly antagonistic groups there are said to be talking to, learning from, and working with one another.      Our problems cannot be solved by twiddling the dials; substantial reforms are needed in many areas.Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 16.Satin (2004), pp. 3–5. Solving our problems will not require massive infusions of new money.Miller (2003), pp. ix–xiii. However, solving our problems will require drawing on the best ideas from left and right and wherever else they may be found.Miller (2003), pp. xii–xii. It will also require creative and original ideas – thinking outside the box.Avlon (2004), p. 21.Halstead and Lind (2001), pp. 6–12.Utne, Leif (September–October 2004). "The Radical Middle".

A mixture of idealism and realism is needed.Satin (2004), pp. 5–6. "Idealism without realism is impotent", says John Avlon. "Realism without idealism is empty". North America and Western Europe have entered an Information Age economy, with new possibilities that are barely being tapped.Halstead and Lind (2001), pp. 13, 56-58, and 64.Satin (2004), pp. 14–17. In this new age, a plurality of people is neither liberal nor conservative, but independentAvlon (2004), pp. 1 and 13. and looking to move in a more appropriate direction.Miller (2003), p. 52. Nevertheless, the major political parties are committed to ideas developed in, and for, a different era; and are unwilling or unable to realistically address the future.Avlon (2004), p. 19.Halstead and Lind (2001), pp. 223–24. Most people in the Information Age want to maximize the amount of choice they have in their lives.Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 19.Satin (2004), pp. 6–8. In addition, people are insisting that they be given a fair opportunity to succeed in the new world they are entering.Miller (2003), Chap. 4. An overriding commitment to fiscal responsibility, even if it entails means-testing of social programs.Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 78.Miller (2003), p. 207.

A commitment to market-based solutions in health care, energy, the environment, etc., so long as the solutions are carefully regulated by government to serve the public good.Avlon (2004), pp. 15 and 26–43 (on Theodore Roosevelt).Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 14. The policy goal, says Matthew Miller, is to "harness market forces for public purposes". A commitment to provide jobs for everyone willing to work, whether by subsidizing jobs in the private sectorMiller (2003), Chap. 8. or by creating jobs in the public sector.Satin (2004), pp. 92–93. A commitment to need-based rather than race-based affirmative action;Halstead and Lind (2001), pp. 170–76.Satin (2004), Chap. 8. more generally, a commitment to race-neutral ideals.Avlon (2004), pp. 257–76 (on Senator Edward W.

Miller's balanced and pragmatic individuals, or Halstead and Lind's triad of disaffected voters, enlightened business leaders, and young people.Halstead and Lind (2004), pp. 214–23. National political leadership is important; local and nonprofit activism is not enough.Avlon (2004), p. 18.Miller (2003), p. 230, and Postscript. Political process reform is also important – for example, implementing rank-order voting in elections and providing free media time to candidates.Halstead and Lind (2001), pp. 109–28.Satin (2004), pp. 198–202. A radical centrist party should be created, assuming one of the major parties cannot simply be won over by radical centrist thinkers and activists. In the meantime, particular independent, major-party, or third-party candidacies should be supported.Satin (2004), Chap. 18. Coyle, Diane (1997).
