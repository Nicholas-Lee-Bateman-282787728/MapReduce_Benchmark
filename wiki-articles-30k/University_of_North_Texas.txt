   The University of North Texas (UNT), based in Denton, is a public institution of higher education and research committed to a wide array of sciences, engineering fields, liberal arts, fine arts, performing arts, humanities, public policy, and graduate professional education. Ten colleges, two schools, an early admissions math and science academy for exceptional high-school-age students from across the state, and a library system comprise the university. Its research is driven by about 34 doctoral degree programs. During the 2013–2014 school year, the university had a budget of $865 million, of which $40 million was allocated for research.  North Texas was founded as a nonsectarian, coeducational, private teachers college in 1890; and, as a collaborative development in response to enrollment growth and public demand, its trustees ceded control to the state in 1899. In 1901, North Texas was formally adopted by the State."Denton Normal School," Dallas Morning News, May 25, 1901, pg. 2 The Denton campus is located in the largest populated region of Texas under two categories defined by the U.S. Census: (i) core based statistical area (CBSA; Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington — 4th largest, nationally) and (ii) combined statistical area (CSA; Dallas-Fort Worth — 7th largest, nationally). From an economic perspective, the Denton campus lies within the Dallas-Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan area, as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, which as of 2011, had the sixth highest GDP (aka gross metropolitan product) of the nation's 366 metropolitan areas.GDP by Metropolitan Area, Advance 2011, and Revised 2001–2010, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, February 22, 2013 As a state, Texas, as of 2011, had the second highest GDP in the country.Table 1. Real GDP by State, 2008–2011, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, June 5, 2012 On behalf of the state, the university, in its civic advocacy for the state, prevailed with three new-location, capital-intensive expansions over the last  years. In 1981, the university spun off its new medical school as its own independent institution under the UNT Board of Regents."Board Okays NT, TCOM Final Merger," by Joyce Hopkins, Denton Record-Chronicle, December 8, 1974  In 2009, the University of North Texas at Dallas became its own independent institution. That same year, the Texas legislature approved the creation of University of North Texas at Dallas College of Law, opening in 2014 in Downtown Dallas as part of UNT Dallas. UNT and its three sister institutions are governed by University of North Texas System — a system established in 1980 by the Board of Regents and legislatively recognized in 2003 by the 78th Texas Legislature.  In 2004, North Texas opened UNT Discovery Park —  — in Denton, north of the main campus with technology incubator facilities dedicated to science and engineering. In 2011, the College of Visual Arts and Design launched the Design Research Center in downtown Dallas in the Design District as a laboratory dedicated to design-driven solutions in a community of real-world professionals.UNT Press Release: UNT opens Design Research Center in Dallas, UNT News Service, January 31, 2011 In 1985 the Governor's Select Committee on Higher Education recommended that North Texas be designated an "emerging national research university."  Nine years earlier, in 1976, the Carnegie Foundation designated North Texas as a "Class 1 Doctorate-Granting Institution."  And in 1988, U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett cited UNT for its innovative approach to undergraduate education in the Classic Learning Core, an integrated liberal arts curriculum similar to those usually found only in small, private colleges. In 1992, UNT was elected to full membership in the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.  And, in 2011, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board included UNT as one of eight Emerging Research Institutions in its accountability system. Certified enrollment as of the fall of 2013 was 36,198, the fourth largest in the state. For the 2011 academic year, the university awarded 8,608 degrees, of which 24 percent were at the graduate level. North Texas awarded 459 PhD degrees from fiscal years 2009 to 2011.   Of the thirteen constituent collegiate units, ten sponsor 97 bachelor's degree programs, and the remaining three units serve other roles. The Toulouse Graduate School coordinates admissions, recruiting, and other aspects of the 81 masters and 34 doctorate degree programs offered by the ten collegiate units. The Honors College is described below. The Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science — for exceptional high-school-aged Texas scholars — awards high school diplomas that reflect two years of accelerated and enriched college classical core academics in biology, chemistry, physics, lab work, mathematics, English, history, political science, interdisciplinary seminar, and electives. The student-faculty ratio at UNT is 23:1, and 28.8 percent of its classes consist of fewer than 20 students. The most popular majors include business, management, marketing, communication, journalism, English, multi/interdisciplinary studies, and visual and performing arts.University of North Texas at "Best Colleges Rankings," U.S. News & World Report As of this year, , North Texas is a -year member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and is among the twenty-seven universities in Texas at Level VI, the highest level. As of 2013, the university was home to seventy-one research centers and institutes, and sixty-one are sponsored by colleges. Three have been sponsored by the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, and seven have been sponsored by the university's Office of Research and Economic Development.  years ago, North Texas launched fifteen research clusters — collaborative, cross-disciplinary teams composed of researchers, faculty, students, multiple departments and/or colleges and outside institutions. Simultaneously, the university launched six additional strategic research areas, some of which involving frontiers in science, medicine, and hi-tech. In 2010, the National Science Foundation ranked UNT (Denton campus) 104th out of 418 academic institutions for cumulative number of science and engineering doctorates awarded. North Texas has offered non-science doctorates — doctorates of philosophy in music and doctorates in education — since 1951. But its science doctorates — doctorates of philosophy in chemistry, biology, and physics and doctorates in business management — were launched in 1964 and 1965, respectively. The College of Engineering has been offering PhD programs since its inception in 2003.National Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Earned Doctorates, 2010 In 2010, the National Science Foundation ranked UNT (Denton campus) 104th out of 418 academic institutions for cumulative number of non-science doctorates awarded.National Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Earned Doctorates, 2010 The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching classifies the University of North Texas as a research university with high research activity. Based on the number of non-science and engineering PhDs awarded at 2,722 national institutions of higher learning in the country, North Texas was ranked as follows:  The College of Arts and Sciences is composed of nineteen academic departments, twenty-three centers and institutes, seven interdisciplinary programs, five public services (including a psychology clinic and a speech and hearing clinic), and eight student services (of which seven are labs). The Department of Political Science is one of the top programs in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of North Texas. The faculty not only rank among the most productive researchers, per capita, in the nation, faculty are also committed to outstanding teaching (having won myriad university and statewide teaching awards) and university service. It is home to the only NSF-REU program in political science, houses the American Political Science Review (2012-2016), and boasts a nationally-recognized peace studies program, bolstered by the Castleberry Peace Institute. The English department has for decades been large. In 1961, it had more English majors than any other Texas institution."Functional, Beautiful, Impressive," Denton Record-Chronicle, March 26, 1961  In 1963, a group of English majors founded the Folk Music Club, which attracted student musicians, several of whom later went on with other performing artists to define a Texas music and cultural movement in Austin that grew to national prominence and left a legacy that endures today (re: Sixth Street, South by Southwest, Austin City Limits, Austin City Limits Music Festival). Its student members included Spencer Perskin,"The Coming of Redneck Hip," by Dan Roth & Jan Charles Reid (born 1945), Texas Monthly, pg. 72, November 1973 Steven Fromholz, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Michael Martin Murphey, and Eddie Wilson (co-founder of Armadillo World Headquarters and current owner of Threadgill's in Austin). Other notable alumni include Larry McMurtry ('58; B.A., English), a prolific fiction writer who, in 1986, won a Pulitzer Prize in Fiction for his novel, Lonesome Dove; and Dick Penner ('58; B.A., English), who co-composed, with Wade Lee Moore, Ooby Dooby, which became a rockabilly hit for North Texas alumnus Roy Orbison. Former notable faculty include Arthur McCullough Sampley, PhD (1903–1975), Texas Poet Laureate from 1951 to 1953. Annie Webb Blanton (1879–1945) — professor of English from 1901 to 1918, suffragist, and author of a series of grammar textbooks. Blanton was elected Superintendent of Texas Public Instruction in 1918, making her the first woman in Texas elected to statewide office. The 1918 July Texas primary and November general election marked the first time Texas women could exercise their right to vote.Biography: "Blanton, Annie Webb," by Debbie Mauldin Cottrell, Handbook of Texas Online (uploaded June 12, 2010; accessed February 12, 2014) As of 2013, the creative writing faculty included Bruce Bond, Corey Marks, and Miro Penkov. J. Baird Callicott, PhD, is a philosopher and prolific research scholar at the frontier of environmental philosophy and ethics. He is a UNT Distinguished Research Professor and Regents Professor in the department and the Institute of Applied Sciences at the university. North Texas has been offering Bachelor of Science degrees for  years, master of science degrees (in biology, mathematics, chemistry, and economics) for  years, and doctor of philosophy degrees in several scientific disciplines — including chemistry, biology, and physics — for  years. North Texas is a sponsoring institution member (PhD-granting) of Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), a consortium of 105 major research universities that leverage scientific research through partnerships with national laboratories, government agencies, and private industry. It has been a member of the consortium since 1954.  The college sponsors 24 distinct research units in the form of centers, institutes, clinics, and laboratories, including the Institute of Applied Science, which conducts science-based interdisciplinary environmental research about the human impact on the environment and uses its findings to develop solutions. Its collaborators include biologists, ecologists, geologists, engineers, computer scientists, chemists, geographers, archaeologists, policy experts, and philosophers. 1951 Nobel Prize laureate Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton (1903–1995) lectured in physics for three months in the fall of 1975"Nobel Scientist Joining Faculty," North Texan, Vol. 26, No. 1, June 1975"NT Nobel Prize Winner: Physicist Right at Home," by Joyce Hopkins, Denton Record-Chronicle, September 19, 1975, pg. 1  The department's Ion Beam and Modification Analysis Laboratory houses four active linear particle accelerators. The lab is among the more sophisticated ion beam facilities in the country. Three of the accelerators are housed in a 450 square-meter, ultra-clean, microbeam, raster-scanning, depth-profiling, Cs-sputtering ion source laboratory, one being a 3 million volt tandem Pelletron accelerator, Model 9-SDH, delveloped by National Electrostatics Corporation, and installed at North Texas in December 1989. It is the workhouse of the laboratory and is used for trace element analysis via accelerator mass spectroscopy.Accelerator Mass Spectrometry at the University of North Texas, by J.M. Anthony, S. Matteson, F.D. McDaniel, J.L. Duggan, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms, v40-41 (April 2, 1989), p. 731-733   One of the older accelerators, a 2.5 MV, is used for routine PIXE, RBS, and NRA and for advanced undergraduate and first year graduate student laboratory experiments. A smaller laboratory, 78-square-meters, houses a 200 kilovolt Cockcroft-Walton accelerator and a 2.5 megavolt Van de Graaff. North Texas is the host of the International Conference on the Application of Accelerators in Research and Industry, held every November. Notable professors in Chemistry include Thomas R. Cundari, PhD, Guido Verbeck, PhD, Angela K. Wilson, PhD (Physical), Oliver Chyan, PhD (Analytic) and Paul Marshall, PhD (Physical).  Some of the research throughout the university extends outside its campuses, including an aquatic biological field station at a nearby lake.   years ago, North Texas partnered with the Chilean Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity at the University of Magallanes, along with several U.S. and Chilean non-profit organizations, to open the world's first environmental philosophy, science and policy field station at the southern tip of Chile in Puerto Williams on Navarino Island and the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. The biology department has for  years been a research pioneer in freshwater conditions. The water research program was initiated and spearheaded by the late Joseph Kean Gwynn Silvey, PhD (1907–1989),Who's Who in America, Volume 33, 1964–1965 Marquis Who's Who, pg. 1841, Chicago a renowned limnologist who joined the biology faculty in 1935"Dr. Silvey: Limnologist," by Dokrthie Erwin, Dallas Morning News, May 6, 1967, Sec. A, pg. 10 and served as chairman of the department from 1952 to 1973. In 2008, a lifesize bronze statue in his honor was installed in front of the Environmental Education, Science and Technology building."NTSU Works to Improve Water Quality, Quantity," North Texan, Vol. 12, No. 4, September 1961 Biochemistry is currently attached to the Biology Department, not Chemistry. It is noted for research in plant lipid research, among others. Notable professors are: Robert Benjamin, PhD; Rebecca Dickstein, PhD; and Richard A. Dixon, ScD. Sociology was established in 1933 by the School of Arts and Sciences as the Department of Sociology and Economics under Jack Vernon Johnson, PhD (1884–1959), who chaired it until his retirement in 1954. Hiram Johnson Friedsam, PhD (1920–2007), a prolific researcher and notable pioneer in the study of aging, chaired it from 1954 to 1972. In 1969, Economics became its own department and the Department of Sociology adopted Anthropology, in name and mission."Motto for Economics, Sociology: Divided We Stand," by Tommy Bonk, The Campus Chat (Denton, Texas), Vol. 52, No. 35, Ed. 1, February 28, 1969, pg. 2  In 1973, the Department of Sociology and Anthropology moved from the School of Arts and Sciences to the newly created School of Community Services (which became a College and added "Public Affairs" to its name in 2005). From 1973 forward, the department launched several centers and institutes — notably the Center for Studies in Aging."Dr. Hiram Friedsam Dean of New Community Services School," Denton Record-Chronicle, August 12, 1973, pg. 6E  More name changes followed — in the mid 1980s, the department was "Sociology, Anthropology, and Social Work," in the mid 1990s, it was "Sociology and Social Work."  In 1996, Sociology became its own department when Social Work merged into the Department of Rehabilitation, Social Work and Addictions. In 1997, Anthropology launched as an Institute and became a full department in 2002. In 2013, Sociology moved back to its founding constituent collegiate unit of 40 years, the College of Arts and Sciences. In 2015, Anthropology also moved back to the College of Arts and Sciences. The Intercollegiate Debate Team is active in the National Debate Tournament and Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA). In September 2012, the team was ranked first in the state and 95th in the world by the International Debate Education Association (IDEA).World University Debate Rankings, International Debate Education Association, August 24, 2012  UNT's Director of Debate, Brian A. Lain, PhD, was coach of the 2012 American National Debate Team sponsored by National Communication Association. North Texas won the second annual National Debate Tournament in 1948 and is the first Texas institution to have won it in its -year history. (Baylor has since won the tournament twice.) In 2015, the Department of Communication Studies became the home of UNT's Computer Mediated Communication Research Lab.   The College of Business is host to five academic departments: (i) Accounting, (ii) Finance, Insurance, Real Estate and Law, (iii) Information Technology and Decision Sciences, (iv) Marketing and Logistics, and (v) Management. It offers seven undergraduate programs, fourteen MBA and master of science programs, and six PhD programs. In Fall 2011, the college moved into a new state-of-the-art Gold LEED certified $70 million facility named the Business Leadership Building.  The college is accredited in both business and accounting by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business — accreditation for the former stretches back  years (1961) and the latter,  years (1987). In 2011, 4,272 students were enrolled as business majors at the undergraduate level — 15% of total undergraduates at the university. In 2011, 718 students were working on graduate degrees — 639 at the masters level and 79 at the PhD level.  470 were in the MBA program, half of whom were full-time, 169 were in Master of Science programs for accounting, 15 were in the Business Computer Information Sciences. The MBA alumni include Michael R. Bowlin (BBA '65/MBA '67), former President and CEO of ARCO. The college is host to three research centers, one applied academics center, and one institute: (i) the Center for Decision and Information Technologies; (ii) the Institute of Petroleum Accounting; (iii) the Murphy Center for Entrepreneurship; (iv) Center for Logistics Education and Research; and (v) the Professional Development Institute. U.S. News & World Report's "2013 Best Online Education Programs" ranked North Texas 20th in the nation among the Best Online Graduate Business Programs.Best Online Graduate Business Programs, U.S. News & World Report, January 2013 The College of Education is a legacy of the university's founding as a teachers college  years ago. The college is organized as four departments and one center: (i) Counseling and Higher Education, (ii) Educational Psychology, (iii) Kinesiology, Health Promotion and Recreation, (iv) Teacher Education and Administration, and (v) The Kristin Farmer Autism Center. As of the Fall 2012, enrollment was 4,178 — 27% at the graduate level (609 masters, 416 doctoral, 86 post doctoral). As of the 2010–2011 school year, the college certified over 1,147 teachers, the second largest number in the state by a university.2010–2011 Annual Performance Report, Texas Education Agency  years ago (March 1979), the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board approved renaming the "School of Education" to the "College of Education."  At that time, the college was the largest in Texas and the Southwest, the largest doctoral program in the state, and the twenty-fifth largest producer teacher certificates in the United States."New Graduate Degrees Approved for NTSU," Dallas Morning News, March 14, 1970, Sec. C, pg. 6  Its prior name, "School of Education," dates back to 1946, when the teachers college outgrew itself and reorganized as six schools and colleges. The doctor of education program is in its  year"First Earned Doctor's Degree Given Ex-Dallasite at NTSC," Dallas Morning News, August 29, 1953, Section–Part I, pg. 7 and the masters program is in its  year.

The college is host to three research centers, one of which being the Net-Centric Software and Systems Center (launched February 24, 2009), a research consortium hosted by UNT and organized as a National Science Foundation Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (NSF I/UCRC). It is primarily funded by industry members (which as of 2012 consist of 16 corporations) and universities (which as of 2012 consist of 5). The focus is developing computing models for the future — models that go beyond applications with preordained fixed capabilities — models capable of services that are dynamically created, verified, and validated in the field and .  The Laboratory for Recreational Computing (LARC) was founded in 1993, distinguishing North Texas as one of the first universities in the country to offer courses in game programming. LARC began offering a certificate program in 2008. More than 500 students have passed through UNT's gaming courses and today many of UNT's graduates are making an impact in the $18-billion gaming industry. In 2010, GamePro and The Princeton Review ranked North Texas in the top 50 of 500 institutions in North America for places to study game design."Gaming Program Readies Students for Top Industry Players," UNT Game Design Lab, accessed April 15, 2015. In addition to the certificate program, Gaming Design offers programs leading to degrees for Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, Master of Science, and Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science & Engineering."Top 50 Undergraduate Video Game Design Programs," The Princeton Review, February 28, 2010  Notable alumni include Cesar Stastny (BS Computer Science, '04), Director of Technology at Treyarch and member of the design team for Call of Duty: World at War. The College of Information was created in October 2008 by consolidating two existing academic units: Learning Technologies (formerly within the College of Education) and the School of Library and Information Sciences. The School of Library and Information Services was created in 1970 as an outgrowth of its former structure as the Department of Library Services."College Adds Four Degrees to Program", Dallas Morning News, 22 October 1970, Sec. A, p. 8. The college sponsors three research centers, one being The Texas Center for Digital Knowledge.  U.S. News & World Report's "2014 Best Grad Schools" ranked three of its graduate programs as among the nation's best: Library and information Sciences (21st), Health Librarianship (6th), and School Library Media (8th)2014 "Best Graduate Schools", U.S. News and World Report, March 2013. The college is structured as a professional school with a global perspective. Enrollment exceeded 1,500 in fall 2011, a 51-percent increase over six years. The college offers bachelor's degrees with majors in digital retailing, home furnishings merchandising, hospitality management and merchandising, and master's degrees in hospitality management, international sustainable tourism and merchandising.   The College of Music is a comprehensive institution of international rank.Warren Henry, PhD, University of North Texas College of Music, The Grove Dictionary of American Music, 2nd edition, February 24, 2010, Oxford University Press; also Oxford Music Online   Its heritage dates back  years, when North Texas was founded. The college has the largest enrollment of any music institution accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music.HEADS Data &ndash; Special Report, 2010–11, National Association of Schools of MusicJames Lloyd Rogers (1926–2006), The Story of North Texas, University of North Texas Press (c2002)   It has been among the largest music institutions of higher learning in North America since the 1940s. The music library, founded in 1941, has one of the largest music collections in the United States, with over 300,000 volumes of books, periodicals, scores, and approximately 900,000 sound recordings. North Texas was first in the world to offer a degree in jazz studies.Philip Allen Scott, Jazz Educated, man; a sound foundation, pg. 19, American International Publishers, Washington, D.C. (©1973)    U.S. News and World Report ranked the jazz studies program as the best in the country every year from 1994, when it began ranking graduate jazz programs, to 1997, when it retired the category.US News and World Report  The One O'Clock Lab Band has been nominated for 6 Grammy Awards. The College of Public Affairs and Community Service, formerly named "College of Community Service," adopted its current name in 2005. The college is organized in six departments, one of which is the Department of Public Administration, home of the nation's first comprehensive degree program in emergency and disaster management that launched  years ago (1983). The degree incorporates interdisciplinary curricula from other colleges that include applied philosophy and environmental ethics. The degree is tailored for both management practitioners and researchers and is collaborative with the Federal Emergency Management Agency Region VI — based in Denton — which oversees Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Denton became home to FEMA when its predecessor, the Office of Civil Defense and Mobilization, constructed the nation's first Federal underground defense center in 1959.Georgia Caraway & Cupit, Images of America: Denton, Arcadia Publishing, pg. 43 (2009)   ISBN 978-0-7385-7854-5 The college is host to five research institutes, one being the Turkish Institute for Police Studies (TIPS). The institute has, since its founding in 1999, been based at North Texas. Its mission is to draw upon practical experience of the Turkish National Police (TNP) — in areas of terrorism, organized crime, narcotics, administration, intelligence, and investigation — and enhance it with an academic and theoretical foundation at the masters and doctorate level at U.S. universities. TIPS also serves as a bridge between the TNP and U.S. law agencies. The institute also coordinates the placement and academic monitoring of students in over twenty-four U.S. Universities, including UNT, American University, Rutgers, University of Maryland, Michigan State University, University of Cincinnati, John Jay College, Kent State University, Sam Houston State University, and the University of Central Florida. TIPS holds professional development worldwide in areas of human rights, police intelligence, community policing, police training, forensic sciences, cyber crime, terrorism, crime analysis, criminology, corruption, juvenile justice, and police administration.Huseyin Durmaz, Bilal Sevinc, Ahmet Sait Yayla, Siddik Ekici Understanding and Responding to Terrorism,  pg. 101, IOS Press (2007) ISBN 978-1-58603-740-6 US News 2012 Grad School survey ranked Public Affairs 54th in the country, and its sub-category, City Management and Urban Policy 9th. The Rehabilitation, Social Work and Addictions, another department within the college, received a ranking of 13 by US News 2012 graduate school survey. The College of Visual Arts and Design has the 10th largest enrollment of any art and design school accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design, and the second largest of any that awards doctorates.HEADS Data &ndash; Special Report, 2010-11, National Association of Schools of Art and Design  The college name changes reflect the curricular expansion of programs. In 1992, what then had been the "Department of Art" within the College of Arts and Sciences, became "School of Visual Arts;" and in 2007, it became the "College of Visual Arts and Design."  Art classes began at UNT in 1894, four years after its founding. Master's degrees were initiated in the 1930s and the first master of science degree in art was awarded in 1937.  US News 2012 grad school survey ranked fine arts 62nd in the nation. Since 1972, the college has served as curator and custodian of the Texas Fashion Collection"NTSU Schedules Exhibition of Fashion Group Costumes," Dallas Morning News, September 2, 1973, pg. E2 that was started by Stanley Marcus in 1938. The Design Research Center (DRC) is sponsored by the Department of Design and is strategically located in downtown Dallas in the heart of the Design District. The center serves as an interdisciplinary structure that draws upon scholars and design practitioners to develop solutions for basic and complex social, environmental, technological, economic, and public policy problems.Strategic Plan for Research: 2010–2010, The University of North Texas Its interior design program is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation.  G. Harvey (Gerald Harvey Jones; born 1933), widely known for his paintings of romantic town street scenes from turn-of-the-century America, is a noted alumnus."An American Original: G.

The faculty includes Nada Shabout, PhD, and Terry Barrett, PhD. Numerous visiting professors include art innovator György Kepes (1944)"Lady on the Edge," by Michael Ennis, Texas Monthly, July 1983, pg. 148 and Carlos Mérida (1944). The Honors College offers academic enrichments, including honors seminars and exclusive classes for high-achieving undergraduates. There is no age limit. Its classes can either supplement or substitute core coursework. Its objective is to challenge exceptional students at higher levels and to promote leadership. The college is an autonomous collegiate unit on equal footing with the other collegiate units. Academically, it offers no degrees; but its courses are integrated with the baccalaureate programs of the nine constituent colleges and the journalism school. Graduates are awarded a special medallion. The college offers many perks, including scholarships, exchange programs, and exclusive housing — Honors Hall. The college began as an honors program  years ago (Fall 1971). Its initial enrollment of 50, back then, quickly grew to 400. But the program lost support under a system of borrowing faculty members.Charldean Newell, "Early Honors," North Texan (alumni magazine), posted online June 11, 2012  The Honors Program was reconstituted in 1994 and was elevated as a college in 2005. Curricular journalism at North Texas dates back to 1945. As a department, Journalism eventually became part of the College of Arts and Sciences. The Graduate Division of Journalism began in the fall of 1970 under the direction of Reginald Conway Westmorland, PhD (born 1926)."Journalism Offers Two New Plans," North Texas Daily, Vol. 54, No. 115 (ed. 1), August 5, 1971 In 1999, twelve years after the death of Frank W. Mayborn, its graduate program was renamed the Frank W. Mayborn Graduate Institute of Journalism. On September 1, 2009, the entire program was elevated as its own collegiate unit and named the Frank W. and Sue Mayborn School of Journalism. Eight Pulitzer Prizes have been won by five of its alumni, among whom are Bill Moyers and Howard Swindle. Other notable alumni include Samir Husni, a world-renowned expert on print journalism, and Cragg Hines. Since 1969, the news-editorial sequence has been accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications; and since 1986, entire program has been accredited. The school is in its  year as founding host of the annual Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference. Virginia Ellison (née Virginia Jones Paty; 1920–2009) — a North Texas alumna (BA, English, '41) who also taught English and journalism, sponsored the Student Press Club, and served as director of publicity at North Texas from 1942 to 1944 — won a Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship in 1945, the year she earned a degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism."3 Win Scholarships," New York Sun, May 18, 1945, pg. 15"Obituary: Virginia Paty Ellison," Houston Chronicle, February 25, 1913"Three Women Get Pulitzer Awards," New York Times, May 18, 1945  She is the mother of Keith P. Ellison, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas.   TAMS is a two-year residential early college entrance program that since 1987 has been serving exceptionally qualified Texas students who otherwise would be attending high school as juniors and seniors. It was the first of its kind in the nation and, as of 2012, the only in the state and one of five in the nation. The Toulouse Graduate School, founded  years ago,"The Education Encyclopedia: Doctor Degrees, Fast Growing Campus Marked NT Development," Denton Record-Chronicle, Sec. V, pg. 5, August 19, 1951 is the academic custodian and administrator of all graduate programs offered by nine colleges and one school. It maintains records, administers admissions, and serves various roles in recruiting. It was renamed in 1990 in honor of Robert Bartell Toulouse, EdD (born 1918), who joined in 1948 as a professor in the College of Education, then served dean of the Graduate School from 1954 to 1982. Toulouse, now professor emeritus, has served other roles at the university, including provost and vice president of academic affairs from 1982 to 1985. UNT Libraries are made up of four public service points and two remote storage facilities. Willis Library is the main library on campus, housing the business, economics, education, humanities and social sciences collections along with microforms and special areas such as the Music Library, Government Documents, the Digital Library Division, Archives, and the Rare Book and Texana collections. The Media Library in Chilton Hall houses a large collection of audiovisual materials, including films, audiobooks, and video games. Video recording equipment and gaming consoles are available for checkout. The Eagle Commons Library in Sycamore Hall focuses on physics, chemistry, biology, art, psychology and mathematics. It also houses the Collaboration and Learning Commons, a place to study in groups, create multi-media projects, and record presentations. The Discovery Park Library supports the College of Engineering and the College of Information, Library Science, and Technologies. It covers multiple areas of engineering, library and information science, and learning technology. Established in 1977, IELI serves international students and is one of the largest language programs for learning academic English in the United States. All freshmen are required to live on campus to satisfy a residency requirement. 15.5% of students, or 5,620, live in on-campus residence halls. In addition, 37.3%, or 13,494, live within the city of Denton while 4,021, or 11.1% live outside of the city of Denton but within Denton County and 36.1% or 13,043 students live outside of Denton County.  There are 13 residence halls on the Denton campus. UNT also offers the Residents Engaged in Academic Living (REAL) Communities program. The REAL communities offer students the ability to live with other residents in their major, and allow them to interact with each other and participate in programs that are geared toward their major or discipline.  On August 22, 2011, -year-old Maple Street Hall became the first all-vegan ("Mean Greens") college cafeteria in the country."Opening Day at UNT's Vegan Cafeteria: Greens Aren't Mean," by Seth Cohn, Dallas Observer, August 23, 2011  The social Greek community is made-up of four councils that oversee 39 fraternities and sororities.  Four percent of students of both genders are members of social fraternities and sororities.  North Texas adopted green and white as its official primary colors during the 1902–1903 school year. In recent years, black has been added as another primary color.  UNT's mascot, the American eagle, was adopted on February 1, 1922, as a result of a student-faculty council debate and ensuing student election."UNT InHouse" (faculty newsletter), December 22, 2005 (retrieved September 17, 2007) InHouse website The eagle has had three nicknames, beginning with "Scrappy" in 1950."North Texas College Plans Huge Bonfire," Dallas Morning News, November 14, 1950, Sec. I, pg. 8  The human costumed eagle character, launched in 1963, carried the name "Scrappy" until 1974 — during the throes of the Vietnam War — when students adopted the name "Eppy" because it sounded less warlike. Since then, the name has switched back and forth, from Eppy to Scrappy; but for the last  years, the name "Scrappy" has endured. In the spring of 2002, a student group attempted to make the albino squirrel the school's secondary mascot. The student body narrowly rejected the measure. In August 2006, the albino squirrel, believed to bring luck to students who spotted him before an exam, was killed by a red-tailed hawk. By May 2007, another albino squirrel had been born on campus.North Texas News Service, February 2006 (retrieved September 17, 2007) Unt.edu  The name "Mean Green," now in its  year, was adopted by fans and media in 1966 for a North Texas football defensive squad that finished the season second in the nation against the rush."Eagles are 19-Point Favorite," Denton Record-Chronicle, Sep 21, 1967, pg 10  That season, Joe Greene, then a sophomore at North Texas, played left defensive tackle on the football team and competed in track and field (shot put). The nickname "Mean Joe Greene" caught-on during his first year with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1969 when Pittsburgh fans wrongly assumed that "Mean Green" was derived from a nickname Joe Greene had inherited while at North Texas. The North Texas athletic department, media, and fans loved the novelty of the national use of its nickname, and its association with Joe Greene's surname and university's official school color. By 1968, "Mean Green" was branded on the backs of shirts, buttons, bumper stickers, and the cover of the North Texas football brochure."Mean Green Same as Nickname," by Mike Cochran (né John Michael Cochran; born 1936), Abilene Reporter-News (AP), September 1, 1968  Francis Edwin Stroup, EdD (1909–2010),Leaders in Education, Fifth edition, R.R.

The song, "Fight, North Texas," has endured for  years and the lyrics have changed minimally to reflect the name changes of the university.  While serving as an Associate Professor at the University of Wyoming from 1946 to 1950, Stroup rewrote the lyrics for the chorus to "Ragtime Cowboy Joe," which was adopted in 1961 as the university's fight song.  After serving as Head of the Physical Education Department at Southern Arkansas University from 1950 to 1959, Stroup became Professor of Physical Education at Northern Illinois University.  While there, Stroup rewrote the lyrics to the chorus of Alonzo Neil Annas' (1882–1966) NIU "Loyalty Song" (©1942), which was informally adopted in 1961 and officially 1963 as the "Huskie Fight Song.""Fight song composer turns 100," by Dana Herra, Daily Chronicle (Illinois), September 7, 2009"Stroup, 101, wrote NIU fight song," by Kate Schott, Daily Chronicle (Illinois), December 3, 2010"Living Knows No Season — Composer of Fight North Texas Crafts a Life Full Of Song," by Jill King, North Texan, Summer 2008"NIU mourns passing of Francis Stroup, Former men's swimming coach penned lyrics to Huskie Fight Song," NIU Today, December 1, 2010College Fight Songs II: A Supplementary Anthology,, by William E.

A collegiate academician who played piano mostly by ear and neither majored nor worked in music, Stroup lived to be 101, a number exceeding the songs he composed by one digit.  Stroup was inducted in the Halls of Fame of Northern Illinois University and the University of North Texas (1987).  In 1919, Julia Smith (1905–1989), while a music student, and Charles Kirby Langford (1903–1931), then a third-year letterman on the football team and an outstanding overall athlete, composed "Glory to the Green and White" which was adopted as the school's alma mater in 1922. Smith wrote the music and Langford wrote the lyrics.Glory to the Green and White: Alma Mater Song, by Julia Smith, Mowbray Music Publishers, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, distributed by Theodore Presser Company (1969)  The Spirit Bell — a  bell brought from Michigan in 1891 — was a curfew bell from 1892 to 1928. The Talons, a spirit and service organization formed in 1960, acquired it in the 1964, mounted it on a wagon, and began the tradition of running it around the football field to rally fans."Four Major Groups Cheer the Eagles to Victory," Denton Record-Chronicle, August 7, 1977, pg 12 It was retired to the University Union in 1982 after it developed a crack. A similar  Spirit Bell is currently in use at games.  A different organization by the name "Talons" was founded in 1926 as the first social fraternity at North Texas."Round About Town," by R. J. "Bob" Edwards, Denton Record-Chronicle, April 17, 1949, pg. 1, col. 1 On Homecoming Fridays, the Talons light a bonfire built from wooden pallets, typically in a 40-by-40-by-25-foot-height structure. The tradition has endured since the 1930s. "Boomer" is a cannon fired by the Talons at football games since the 1970s. It is a 7/8th scale M1841 6 pound, smooth bore muzzleloader, resting on hand-crafted solid oak from the campus. Talon alumni have restored it three times, the most recent being in the Fall of 2007, adding a custom  for transport and equipment. The Green Machine, a green 1931 Ford Model A Tudor Sedan, is driven by the Talons Cannon Crew at football games and special events. It was donated by alumnus Rex Cauble ('74). In 2012, a team of engineering students installed a NetGain WarP 9 electric engine."Mean Green Machine Gets a 'Green' Makeover," North Texan, May 11, 2012 McConnell Tower, the clock tower atop the Hurley Administration Building at the center of campus, is bathed in green light for victories. The clock is depicted on the official class ring with two different times on its faces: 1:00 (for the One O'Clock Lab Band) and 7:00 — the curfew initiated in 1892. The eagle talon hand signal is formed by curling the thumb and index and middle fingers forward — the ring and pinkie fingers stay closed against the palm. "In High Places," is a  tall bronze statue of a flying eagle created by Gerald Balciar and dedicated during the University's centennial in 1990.  KNTU (88.1 FM), licensed and owned by the university and operated by students, has, for  years,"KNTU-FM Reaches Air: NT Radio Becomes Reality," Denton Record-Chronicle, November 4, 1969 broadcast to the North Texas region. Jazz has always been a feature of the station; but in 1981, it became the predominant format. KNTU began broadcasting in stereo in 1986 and, on March 22, 1988, increased its broadcasting power from 6,700 watts to 100,000, extending its reach to about a 60-mile radius from its tower located on the Denton campus. KNTU is part of the Mean Green Radio Network, which reaches 10 million listeners. Under the guidance of now-retired faculty member Bill Mercer, several sports broadcasters and radio personalities have emerged from North Texas, including Dave Barnett formerly of ESPN, George Dunham, and Craig Miller. NTTV, UNT's 24-hour cable television station, features student-produced and student-centric programming.  North Texas Review is an annual publication of the English Department. It is produced by UNT students and exclusively features works — art, poetry, fiction, non-fiction — by UNT students.North Texas Review 2010, University of North Texas, Department of English (1991–)  Student yearbooks through the years have included Cotton-tail (1906), Yucca (1907–1974), Wings (1977–1980), and Aerie (1982–2007).

As of 2012, North Texas sponsored fifteen athletic teams that compete at the intercollegiate level of NCAA Division I — for men: football;  for men and women: basketball, track & field, cross country, and golf; for women only: Diving, Soccer, Softball, Swimming, Tennis, and Volleyball. UNT has been a member of Conference USA since 2013. In its –year history of intercollegiate athletics, the North Texas football team has won 24 conference championships, with the last four occurring from 2001 to 2004 in the Sun Belt Conference.  As of 2014, the team has appeared in eight bowl games, winning three — including the 2002 New Orleans Bowl and the 2014 Heart of Dallas Bowl. Dan McCarney is in his  year as head coach. From 1952 to 2010, home football games were played at Fouts Field. In 2011, UNT began playing in newly constructed Apogee Stadium. The North Texas men's basketball team won the 2006–2007 Sun Belt Conference championship and advanced to the NCAA Tournament. The season marked the beginning of a four consecutive seasons of 20-plus wins. North Texas won the Sun Belt Conference championship again during the 2009–2010 season, and again advanced to the NCAA Tournament. The – season marks the  season that the UNT Coliseum has served as the home for Men's basketball.

It was originally housed in leased facilities above the B.J. Wilson Hardware Store on the northwest corner of Denton Square (current location of Ethan Allen Furniture). Crumley1893–1894 In 1893, Chilton turned the school over to John Jackson Crumley, who, among his accomplishments, helped put the "North" into "North Texas."  The renaming was the result of a mixup when Emory C. Smith, a State Senator from Denton, introduced a bill (with "North Texas" in its name) that passed in the Texas Legislature in 1893 authorizing the College to issue teaching certificates. Terrill1894–1899 Menter Bradley Terrill led the College following the Panic of 1893. He ended his term as president when the College became state institution in 1899 under its new name, "North Texas State Normal College."  He went on to found the Terrill School for boys in Dallas in 1906 and played a role in persuading Ela Hockaday, who earned a Bachelor of Arts from North Texas in 1897, to start a school for girls in 1913. Both schools prevailed as Dallas' first attempts to develop private schools on par with some of the exceptional East Coast counterparts."Miss. Ela Builds a Home," by Patricia Conner Coggan, Legacies: A History Journal for Dallas and North Central Texas, Vol. 14, No. 1, Spring 2002 Kendall1899–1906 Joel Sutton Kendall is credited for having strengthened a start-up institution, improved its physical facilities, and raised standards in a statewide operational setting that, in the words of historian James Rogers, was "backwards." Bruce1906–1923 William Hershel Bruce, PhD (Mercer), AM (Baylor), AB (Auburn), elevated North Texas from normal to full state-college status. North Texas, before 1921, had maintained high standards of a senior liberal arts college; but, its academic structure was legislatively limited to that of a professional school devoted to training teachers. In the 1917–1918 school-year, North Texas introduced programs leading to a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science degree. Broadening academic disciplines was part of a mandated State and concerted national movement to strengthen teachers colleges. In 1921, the State approved its new name, North Texas State Teachers College.Year Book, The American Association of Teachers Colleges,  pg. 104 (1922)  That same year, North Texas was admitted to Class A membership in the American Association of Teachers Colleges. Bruce was an internationally known mathematics pedagogue who began his career at North Texas in 1901 as a math professor.Day in the Sun, by Ron Hendry, pg. 56 (2006)  Marquis1923–1934 In 1925, Robert Lincoln Marquis launched a controversial statewide campaign to ban freshmen and first-year transfers from competing in intercollegiate athletics. Roy Bedichek, then the chief of Intercollegiate Bureau of the University of Texas Division of Extension, was among his strongest allies. That same year, five religious denominated universities — Southwestern, Trinity University (Texas), Howard Payne University, Simmons University, and Austin College — resigned from the TIAA  to form the Texas Conference. The measure passed in 1927; but there was little success with enforcement. Marquis died in 1934. McConnell1934–1951 Under president Weston Joseph McConnell, the college grew tremendously; the first master's degrees were awarded in 1936. By 1940, North Texas was the largest state supported teachers college in the world;"W.N. Masters, Pioneer of Teachers College Faculty, Gives Personality Sketch of Each of Presidents Serving Institution," Denton Record-Chronicle, April 16, 1940, pg. 10 and, McConnell hired a music school pioneer, Wilfred Bain, who restructured the music program into a comprehensive music school, which as of the early 1940s, became one of the largest in the country. In May 1949, North Texas, by enactment of the Fifty-first Texas Legislature, dropped the word "Teachers" from its name, divorced itself from statewide teachers college system, and established a board of regents of its own. Its enrollments during 1947–48 and 1948–49 increased more than any other institution in the state. In 1949, it was the fourth largest institution in the state and the only teachers college in the South that was fully approved by the American Association of Universities."Big Growth Seen for NTSC," by Riley Cross, Dallas Morning News, May 22, 1949, Sec.IV, pg. 5Down the Corridor of Years: A Centennial History of the University of North Texas in Photographs, 1890–1990, by Robert Sherman La Forte (born 1933) & Richard L.

Matthews also oversaw important developments, including mandated integration in 1956. In 1961, the college became North Texas State University. While North Texas had been offering doctor of education degrees and doctor of philosophy degrees in music (in composition, musicology, and theory) since September 1950, the Texas Commission on Higher Education authorized doctor of philosophy programs in chemistry, biology, and physics in 1964 — and doctor of philosophy in business administration in 1965. Beginning of desegregation — 1954  In June 1954, A. Tennyson Miller (né Lord Alfred Tennyson Miller; 1913–1993), a principal at Lincoln High School in Port Arthur who had been accepted in the doctoral program in education, became the first African American student to enroll."Coming Together, A Retrospective Look at Integration on Campus," North Texan, Vol. 44, No. 2, June 1994  He had been admitted under the Heman Marion Sweatt ruling."NTSC Admits Negro Student," Dallas Morning News, July 21, 1954, sec. I, pg 5 Joseph Louis Atkins (born 1936), who had recently graduated from high school, visited North Texas in June 13, 1955 — accompanied by his mother, Mable, and Juanita Craft — to seek enrollment for that fall. University officials turned Atkins down, reportedly, to avoid statutes of the state prohibiting enrollment of African American undergraduates. Atkins, a minor, and his father, Willie, sued Matthews in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Sherman to force the university of uphold Brown vs. Board of Education.Joe L. Atkins, a Minor, by his father and next friend, Willie Atkins, v. James Carl Matthews, President, North Texas State College, et al., U.S. District Court, Eastern District, Texas (59th District), Civ. No. 1104, 19 September 1955  On December 2, 1955, Judge Joe Sheehy ruled in Atkins' favor, denying North Texas the right to refuse admission to Atkins and further ordering Matthews to immediately implement its proposed "gradual plan" for admitting African American undergraduates.Advancing Democracy: African Americans and the Struggle for Access and Equity in Higher Education in Texas, Amilcar Shabazz, University of North Carolina Press (2004) "Judge Tells N.T.S.C. to Admit Negroes," Dallas Morning News, December 3, 1955, Sec. 1, pps 1 & 3 Matthews waived his option to appeal and made plans to integrate the following semester. Atkins had already enrolled at the University of Texas at El Paso which admitted him and 12 other African Americans in the Fall of 1955 in compliance with a court order from the Thelma White case. But at North Texas, in February 1956, Irma Etta Sephas (née Irma Etta Loud; 1914–1991) became the first African American undergraduate to enroll. Ben Wooten, a North Texas alumnus and the Chairman of the Board of Regents at the time, later stated that a court order served to minimize potential controversy, rather than had the university been proactive under its own volition. Grace Cartwright, another regent, said that the board began making plans for desegregation almost as soon as the Atkins lawsuit had been filed. Matthews, who had barred the media from campus and maintained a low profile during desegregation, has in retrospect, been cited favorably for having employed a strategy devoid of any major incident, relative to antagonistic occurrences at other institutions and continued widespread denials of admissions. In the fall of 1956, after the race barrier had been broken at North Texas, then Governor Allan Shivers launched a fight against desegregation in Texas, ordering state police to prevent the court-ordered desegregation of Mansfield High School. That same year, at Texarkana Junior College and Lamar State College in Beaumont, angry mobs turned away African American students. Atkins returned to North Texas in 1967 to earn a master's degree and had a successful career as a school teacher and education consulting. In March 2001, the Texas Legislative Black Caucus presented him with the "Outstanding Texan Award."  In March 2001, UNT awarded two Doctor of Humane Letters degrees, one to Atkins and one (posthumously) to Miller — and has since established two scholarships in their names. Kamerick1968–1970 John Joseph Kamerick, PhD (born 1919), who previously had been Vice President and Provost of Kent State University, was considered an academic progressive who presided during a national atmosphere of student protests, primarily in opposition to the Vietnam War. Students and faculty perceived him favorably as a strong academic and advocate of academic freedom."This Student Demonstration to Honor NTSU President," Dallas Morning News, December 10, 1969, pg. A12  He resigned in 1970, reportedly under pressure from then Governor Preston Smith."State Relations Caused Quitting," Dallas Morning News, May 28, 1970, pg. A12  In sharp contrast to his predecessor, Kamerick was a proponent of involving students and faculty in forming new policies. He also ended Matthews' moratorium on private fund-raising and foundation development. Nolen,Vandiver1970–1982 Presidents during this period: John L. Carter, Jr. (acting, 1970–1971), C.C.
