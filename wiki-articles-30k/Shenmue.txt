     is an open-world action-adventure video game developed by Sega AM2, produced and directed by Yu Suzuki, and published by Sega for the Dreamcast in December 1999 in Japan and late 2000 in other territories. It is the first game in the Shenmue series, a "revenge epic in the tradition of Chinese cinema", which Suzuki plans to span at least four games. Shenmue consists of open-world 3D environments interspersed with brawler battles and quick time events. It features a level of detail considered unprecedented at the time, including a day-and-night system, variable weather effects, non-player characters with daily schedules, and various minigames. The story follows the teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki as he sets out in revenge for the murder of his father in 1980s Yokosuka, Japan. After developing several successful Sega arcade games, including Hang-On (1985), Out Run (1986) and Virtua Fighter (1993), Suzuki wanted to create a longer game experience. AM2 began work on an RPG for the Sega Saturn set in the Virtua Fighter world. In 1997, development moved to the Dreamcast, the game was named Shenmue and the Virtua Fighter connection was dropped. It became the most expensive video game ever developed at the time, with an estimated production and marketing cost of $47 to $70 million USD, though some of the development also covered Shenmue II (2001). Shenmue received mostly positive reviews; critics praised its graphics, soundtrack, realism and ambition, but criticized its slow pace and voice acting. Though its unusual focus on mundane details divided players, it attracted a cult following, appearing in several "greatest video games of all time" lists, and is credited for pioneering game systems including quick time events and open-world environments. Despite sales of 1.2 million, Shenmue did not recoup its development cost and is considered a commercial failure. After the release of Shenmue II, further games in the series entered development hell. In July 2015, Suzuki and his development company Ys Net began developing Shenmue III for PlayStation 4 and PC after a successful crowdfunding campaign, having licensed the rights from Sega. In 1986 Yokosuka, Japan, teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki returns to his family dojo to witness a confrontation between his father Iwao and a Chinese man, Lan Di. Ryo intervenes, but is easily incapacitated. Lan Di demands Iwao give him a mysterious stone artifact known as the dragon mirror. When he threatens to kill Ryo, Iwao tells him the mirror is buried under the cherry blossom tree outside. As Lan Di's men dig up the mirror, he mentions a man Iwao allegedly killed in China. He delivers a finishing blow and Iwao dies in Ryo's arms. Ryo swears revenge on Lan Di. He begins his investigation by interviewing people about what they witnessed. Just as he is about to run out of leads, a letter addressed to Ryo's father arrives from a Chinese man named Zhu Yuanda suggesting he seek the aid of Master Chen, who works at Yokosuka Harbor. Through Chen and his son Guizhang, Ryo learns that the dragon mirror taken by Lan Di is one of two mirrors. He locates the second, the phoenix mirror, in a hidden basement beneath his father's dojo. Chen reveals that Lan Di has left Japan for Hong Kong. Ryo borrows money to buy a plane ticket from a disreputable travel agency; when he goes to collect the ticket, he is ambushed by Chai, a member of Lan Di's criminal organization, the Chi You Men, who destroys his ticket. Ryo learns that the Chi You Men is connected to the local harbor gang, the Mad Angels, and takes a job at the harbor as a forklift driver to investigate. After he causes trouble, the Mad Angels kidnap his schoolfriend Nozomi. Ryo rescues her and makes a deal with the Mad Angels leader to beat up Guizhang in exchange for a meeting with Lan Di. Ryo realizes the deal is a trap and teams up with Guizhang to defeat the Mad Angels. Ryo arranges to take a boat to Hong Kong with Guizhang. On the day of departure, they are attacked by Chai. Ryo defeats him, but Guizhang is injured in the fight and urges Ryo to go without him, saying he will meet him in China later. Chen advises Ryo to seek the help of a martial artist in Hong Kong named Lishao Tao. Ryo boards the boat and leaves for Hong Kong.  The player controls teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki as he investigates his father's murder: exploring the game's open world, searching for clues, examining objects and talking to non-player characters for information. The game features a 3D fighting system similar to Sega's Virtua Fighter series; Ryo can fight multiple opponents at once, and practice moves to increase their power. In quick time events, the player must press the right button within a time limit to succeed. Shenmue features a level of detail considered unprecedented for games at the time. Shops open and close, buses run to timetables, and characters have their own routines, each in accordance with the game's persistent clock. Though not all objects are interactive, the player can inspect elements including drawers, cabinets and shelves. Ryo receives a daily allowance which can be spent on items including food, raffle tickets, audio cassettes and capsule toys. There are several minigames; in the local arcade, for example, Ryo can throw darts or play complete versions of the Sega arcade games Hang-On and Space Harrier. Later in the game, Ryo gets a part-time job at the docks and must ferry crates between warehouses and compete in races using a forklift. Edge described Shenmue as "a game of middle management, often composed of the unglamorous daily grinds – being home for bedtime, wisely spending money earned from a day job, or training combat moves through lonely practice – that other games bypass." According to GamesRadar, Shenmue's appeal lies in "soaking up all this detail and really feeling like you're in this world&nbsp;... walking leisurely back to your home as the night draws in, watching the shadows move under Ryo's feet."<ref name=":02" /> In 2015, ''Shenmue'' creator [[Yu Suzuki]] said he felt the series was popular because "by focusing on nostalgia and the ordinary, ''Shenmue'' creates a window into Japanese and Chinese culture&nbsp;... it shows us cultural differences through the ordinary and familiar."<ref>{{cite web|title = From the Desk of Yu Suzuki: A Community Exclusive Update Pack! ~Oct 30th 2015|url = http://shenmueambassador.tumblr.com/post/132143057983/from-the-desk-of-yu-suzuki-a-community-exclusive|website = shenmueambassador.tumblr.com|accessdate = October 30, 2015}}</ref>  ==Development== [[File:Yu Suzuki - Game Developers Conference 2011 - Day 3 (2).jpg|thumb|''Shenmue'' was created, produced and directed by Yu Suzuki.|left]] ''Shenmue'' creator [[Yu Suzuki]] joined Sega in 1983 and went on to create several successful [[arcade game]]s including ''[[Hang-On]]'' (1985)'', [[Out Run]]'' (1986) and ''[[Virtua Fighter (series)|Virtua Fighter]]'' (1993)''.''<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title = Creator Yu Suzuki shares the story of Shenmue's development|url = http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/19/5527120/yu-suzuki-shenmue-gdc-2014-classic-game-postmortem|website = Polygon|accessdate = June 29, 2015}}</ref> In comparison to arcade games, where the ideal experience was only a few minutes long, Suzuki wanted to make a longer experience and researched [[Role-playing game (video game)|role-playing games]].<ref name=":0" /> To test camera, combat and conversation systems, he and [[Sega AM2]] built a prototype [[Sega Saturn]] game called ''The Old Man and the Peach Tree'' about a young man, Taro, seeking a martial arts [[grandmaster (martial arts)|grandmaster]] in 1950s [[Luoyang]], China.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title = Shenmue once featured cats that walk on two legs|url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-03-19-shenmue-once-featured-cats-that-walk-on-two-legs|accessdate = June 29, 2015}}</ref> Taro brings an old man a peach in exchange for information about the grandmaster's location; at the end of the game, the old man skilfully skips stones across water to hunt fish, suggesting that he is the grandmaster.<ref name=":0" />  In 1996, AM2 began developing a 3D Saturn RPG with the working title ''Guppy''.<ref name=":1" /> This became an RPG based on the ''[[Virtua Fighter (series)|Virtua Fighter]]'' [[Virtua Fighter (series)|series]], titled ''Virtua Fighter RPG: Akira's Story'', with the ''Virtua Fighter'' character Akira as the hero.
