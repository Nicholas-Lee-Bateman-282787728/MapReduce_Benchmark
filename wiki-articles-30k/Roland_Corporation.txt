    The  is a Japanese manufacturer of electronic musical instruments, electronic equipment and software. It was founded by Ikutaro Kakehashi in Osaka on April 18, 1972, with ¥33 million in capital. In 2005, Roland's headquarters relocated to Hamamatsu in Shizuoka Prefecture. Today it has factories in Italy, Taiwan, Japan, and the USA. As of March 31, 2010, it employed 2,699 employees.Roland Corporate Data It has existed in different forms since 1960, making it relatively old among still-operating manufacturers of musical electronics. Known for hundreds of popular synthesizers, drum machines, and other instruments, Roland has been one of the top names in professional music equipment since the late 1970s. In 2014, Roland Corporation was subject to a management buyout by Roland's CEO Junichi Miki, supported by Taiyo Pacific Partners.  Kakehashi founded Ace Electronic Industries in 1960, a manufacturer of numerous combo organs, guitar amplifiers, and effects pedals. He was also contracted by Hammond to produce rhythm machines for the company's line of home organs. In 1973, Kakehashi cut ties with both companies to found Roland. As with many Japanese start-ups of the period, the name Roland was selected for export purposes as Kakehashi was interested in a name that was easy to pronounce for his worldwide target markets. Rumour has long circulated that he named his company after the French epic poem La Chanson de Roland. In reality, the name Roland was found in a telephone directory. Kakehashi opted for it as he was satisfied with the simple two-syllable word and its soft consonants. The letter "R" was chosen because it was not used by many other music equipment companies, and would therefore stand out in trade show directories and industry listings. Kakehashi did not learn of "The Song Of Roland" until later.I Believe In Music, Ikutaro Kakehashi with Robert Olsen, 2002. p. 64 Roland markets products under a number of brand names, each of which are used on products geared toward a different niche. At one point, Roland acquired the then-defunct Rhodes name, and released a number of digital keyboards bearing the Rhodes brand, but it no longer owns the name. The late Harold Rhodes regained the right to the name in 2000. Rhodes was dissatisfied with Roland's treatment of the marque, and had plans to re-introduce his iconic electric piano, but died before he was able to bring it to market.  1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987  1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 DIGITAL RECORDERS HOME/ACCOMPANIMENT PRODUCTS GUITAR SYNTHS MASTER KEYBOARDS PIANOS RHYTHM PRODUCTS SAMPLERS SEQUENCERS SOUND CANVASES SYNTHS & HI-TECH 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 AMPS, MIXERS & SPEAKERS DIGITAL ACCORDIONS FR5 & FR7 DIGITAL RECORDERS & MIXERS EDIROL PRODUCTS GUITAR SYNTHS HOME/ARRANGER KEYBOARDS ORGANS PIANOS RHYTHM PRODUCTS SYNTHS & HI-TECH 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2014 As of May 23, 2015, SubBass Academy of Electronic Music will be hosting the world's first Roland certified Aira Academy.Roland AIRA Course David Barnard, Roland's education consultant said he was delighted to welcome SubBass as the world’s first AIRA Academy and looks forward to developing a range of courses that balance technical knowledge with musical know-how.World first Roland Aira Academy launches at SubBass 2015 The Roland brand is used on a wide range of products including synthesizers, digital pianos, electronic drum systems, dance/DJ gear, guitar synthesizers, amplifiers, and recording products. BOSS is a brand used for products geared toward guitar players and is used for guitar pedals, effects units, rhythm and accompaniment machines, and portable recording equipment. Edirol was a line of professional video-editing and video-presentation systems, as well as portable digital audio recorders. Edirol also had Desktop Media (DTM) products, more production-oriented, and included computer audio interfaces, mixers, and speakers. Following Roland's purchase of a controlling interest in Cakewalk Software, most of the division's products were rebranded as Cakewalk products or blended with the professional audio/RSS products to form Roland Systems Group. Roland Systems Group is a line of professional commercial audio and video products. Rodgers was founded in 1958 as an organ company and survives today as a subsidiary of Roland, still manufacturing high-quality electric, electronic, and pipe organs. Cakewalk music software company is a long-term partner of Roland’s. In January 2008, Roland announced the purchase of controlling interest in the company. In 2013, ownership of Cakewalk passed from Roland to Gibson Guitar Corporation.

The JV-80 also came in a 1U rack spaced unit aptly named, the JV-880 sound module. Roland SR-JV80 Sample Wave ROM Expansion Boards: Both the JV-80 and JV-880 could also be expanded with Roland's proprietary SR-JV80 series expansion boards. These expansion boards at the time of their release could add up to an extra 8mb of wave sample ROM, thus increasing the number of patches (sounds) that could be played and accessed. Later, during the next eight years, the SR-JV80 expansion boards would also be integrated and adapted to the JV, XP and XV line of Roland keyboards and sound modules. Interestingly enough after more than 20 years, since their release date, the SR-JV80 expansion boards continue to be considered a valued sound source in various contemporary music styles among songwriters and musicians, due to the high quality of the sample wave ROM that was used at the time. Roland produced the SR-JV80 series Expansion Boards for specific types of music genres, which included, but not limited to: R&B, Soul, Rap, Country, Rock, Vintage Rock, Instrumental and Orchestra (classical instruments). In addition the SR-JV80 series expansion boards have been used in many movies, TV shows, plays and popular music during the last two decades - It is widely known that Star Wars composer and former Boston Pops conductor John Williams used various Roland JV products with the SR-JV80 expansions boards; Also, the late film composer Jerry Goldsmith who composed five Star Trek movie scores, The Mummy and Air Force One among others, had a JV-1080 with various SR-JV80 boards. The SR-JV80 expansion boards sample wave ROMs were done so well, that Roland decided to continue to use them in the SRX line of expansion boards well into 21st century.SynthMania.com has many different Roland SR-JV80 boards and highlights associated sounds with each board, but does not contain all the patch names and all the sounds of each board; The Roland Corporate Support website has all the different boards listed here along with manuals which contain patch listings.
