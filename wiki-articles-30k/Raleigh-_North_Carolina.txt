   Raleigh (; ) is the capital of the state of North Carolina as well as the seat of Wake County in the United States. It is the second most populous city in North Carolina, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the "City of Oaks" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of . The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population to be 439,896 as of July 1, 2014. It is also one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County. Raleigh is home to North Carolina State University and is part of the Research Triangle area, together with Durham (home of Duke University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The "Triangle" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham & Wake Counties partway between the three cities and their universities. The Research Triangle region encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013. The Raleigh Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013. Most of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a very small portion extending into Durham County. The towns of Cary, Morrisville, Garner, Clayton, Wake Forest, Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, Knightdale, Wendell, Zebulon, and Rolesville are some of Raleigh's primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns. Raleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city, chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. In the United States Civil War the city was spared from any significant battle, only falling in the closing days of the war, though it did not escape the economic hardships that plagued the rest of the American South during the Reconstruction Era. The twentieth century saw the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, and with the jobs it created the region and city saw a large influx of population, making it one of the fastest growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century. Raleigh is home to numerous cultural, educational, and historic sites. The Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts in Downtown Raleigh features three theater venues and serves as the home for the North Carolina Symphony and the Carolina Ballet. Walnut Creek Amphitheatre is a large music amphitheater located in Southeast Raleigh. Museums in Raleigh include the North Carolina Museum of Art in West Raleigh, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History and North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences located next to each other near the State Capitol in Downtown Raleigh. Several major universities and colleges call Raleigh home, including North Carolina State University, the largest public university in the state, and Shaw University, the first historically black university in the American South and site of the foundation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, an important civil rights organization of the 1960s. One U.S. president, Andrew Johnson, was born in Raleigh. Bath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the establishment at the new capital New Bern in 1743.  In December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties. The county gets its name from Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury. New Bern, a port town  from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, governing from that location on the wide Neuse River became infeasible. Raleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast, and was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital (incorporated on December 31, 1792 - charter granted January 21, 1795). The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the "lost colony" on Roanoke Island. The city's location was chosen, in part, for being within  of Isaac Hunter's Tavern, a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators. No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South streets. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia. The North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and quickly granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners (elected by the city after 1803) and an "Intendant of Police" (which would eventually become the office of Mayor) to govern it. In 1799, the N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser became the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.  In 1808, Andrew Johnson, the nation’s 17th President, was born at Casso’s Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures the project was abandoned. 1819 saw the arrival of Raleigh's first volunteer fire company, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company. In 1817 the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh. In 1831, a fire destroyed the State Capitol. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried granite being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new Capitol and new Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company in 1840. In 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition. After the Civil War began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. During General Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, Raleigh was captured by Union cavalry under the command of General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick on April 13, 1865. As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War, but due to the economic problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.       After the Civil War ended in 1865, African Americans were emancipated. The Reconstruction legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the Freedmen's Bureau, many freedmen migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had a free black community and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas. Shaw University, the South's first African-American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans. In 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation’s first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. And in 1874, a Federal Building was constructed in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the South following the Civil War. In 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer. It remains Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established. In the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. They were unsuccessful. In 1900, the state legislature passed a new constitution, with voter registration rules that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office, local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive. It was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. No African American was elected to Congress until 1992. In 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating. From 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleigh citizens. In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster. On December 12, 1924, The Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI and the Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop. The city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing. During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943. In 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a council-manager form of government, the current form. The Dorton Arena, a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena designed by Matthew Nowicki, was opened in 1952 on the grounds of the North Carolina State Fair. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Raleigh experienced significant damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954. In 1956, WRAL-TV became the first local television station. With the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, Raleigh began to experience a population increase, resulting in a total city population of 100,000 by 1960. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Raleigh's population as 76.4% white and 23.4% black. Following passage of the federal Voting Rights Act, one of the main achievements of the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) and the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, political participation and voting by African Americans in Raleigh increased rapidly. In 1967, Clarence E. Lightner was elected to the City Council, and in 1973 became Raleigh's first African-American mayor. In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country. During the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, easing traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads. The first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977. Fayetteville Street was turned into a pedestrian-only street in an effort to help the then-ailing downtown area, but the plan was flawed and business declined for years to come. Fayetteville Street was reopened in 2007 as the main thoroughfare of Raleigh's downtown. The 1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak of November 28, 1988, was the most destructive of the seven tornadoes reported in Northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia between 1:00 AM and 5:45 AM. The Raleigh tornado produced over $77 million in F4 damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in Nash County) and 154 injuries. The damage path from the storm was measured at  long, and  wide at times. In 1991, two large skyscrapers in Raleigh were completed, First Union Capitol Center and Two Hannover Square, along with the popular Walnut Creek Amphitheatre in Southeast Raleigh. In 1996, the Olympic Flame passed through Raleigh while on its way to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Also in 1996, Hurricane Fran struck the area, causing massive flooding and extensive structural damage. In addition, WRAL-TV became the first High-Definition broadcast station in the world. In 1997, the National Hockey League's Hartford Whalers announced their intention to move to Raleigh as the Carolina Hurricanes, becoming the city's first major league professional sports franchise. In 1999, the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later renamed the RBC Center and now called PNC Arena), opened to provide a home for the Hurricanes and the [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball]] team, as well as an up-to-date major concert venue.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|last= |first= |title=City of Raleigh Years (1991 - 1999) |work= |publisher=City of Raleigh |date= |url=http://www.raleighnc.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-150347-Years__1991___1999.html |accessdate=2008-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060302040927/http://www.raleighnc.gov:80/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-150347-Years__1991___1999.html |archivedate=March 2, 2006 }}</ref>  ===21st century=== In the first decade of the 21st century, Raleigh was featured prominently in a number of "Top 10 Lists," including those by [[Forbes]], [[MSNBC]] and [[Money (magazine)|Money Magazine]], due to its quality of life and business climate.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  In 2001, the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium complex was expanded with the addition of the [[Progress Energy Inc|Progress Energy]] Center for the Performing Arts, Meymandi Concert Hall, Fletcher Opera Theater, Kennedy Theatre, Betty Ray McCain Gallery and Lichtin Plaza.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|last= |first= |title=City of Raleigh Years (1999 - 2002) |work= |publisher=City of Raleigh |date= |url=http://www.raleighnc.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-155646-Years__1999___2002.html |accessdate=2008-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060302040933/http://www.raleighnc.gov:80/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_306_202_0_43/http%3B/pt03/DIG_Web_Content/category/Resident/Raleigh_At_A_Glance/History_of_Raleigh/Cat-2CA-2006109-155646-Years__1999___2002.html |archivedate=March 2, 2006 }}</ref>  Fayetteville Street reopened to vehicular traffic in 2006. A variety of downtown building projects began around this time including the 34-story RBC Bank Tower, multiple condominium projects and several new restaurants.

[[File:Raleigh-trolley.jpg|thumb|The Raleigh Trolley tour going through Downtown]] Raleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] and [[Atlantic coastal plain|Atlantic Coastal Plain]] regions meet. This area is known as the "[[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]]" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of [[Atlantic Beach, North Carolina]], by car and four hours east of the [[Great Smoky Mountains]].

This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the [[Swift Creek Township, Wake County, North Carolina|Swift Creek]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], to the east by [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]], and to the southwest by [[Holly Springs, North Carolina|Holly Springs]]. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.  ====Southeast Raleigh==== Southeast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]] on the southwest, and rural [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]] to the southeast.

[[Shaw University]] is located in this part of the city.  ===Climate=== [[File:Raleighsnow2007.jpg|thumb|right|Snow in Raleigh on a morning in January 2007]] Like much of the southeastern United States, Raleigh has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with four distinct seasons. Winters are short and generally cool, with a January daily average of {{convert|41.0|°F|1}}. On average, there are 69&nbsp;nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7&nbsp;days that fail to rise above freezing.<ref name = NOAA /> April is the driest month, with an average of {{convert|2.91|in|1}} of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a daily average in July of {{convert|80.0|°F|1}}. There are 48&nbsp;days per year with highs at or above {{convert|90|°F|0}}.<ref name = NOAA/> Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall. Extremes in temperature have ranged from {{convert|−9|°F|0}} on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]] up to {{convert|105|°F|0}}, most recently on [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave|July 8, 2012]].  Raleigh receives an average of {{convert|6.0|in|cm|1}} of [[snow]] in winter. [[Freezing rain]] and [[Ice pellets|sleet]] also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging [[ice storm]]. On January 24–25, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm{{spaced ndash}}{{convert|20.3|in|cm|0}}{{spaced ndash}}the [[January 25, 2000 Winter Storm|Winter Storm of January 2000]]. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of [[cold air damming]] that affects the city due to its proximity to the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  Winter storms have caused [[Winter storm transportation impact#January 2005|traffic problems]] in the past as well.  The region also experiences occasional periods of [[drought]], during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience [[hurricane]]s. In 1996, [[Hurricane Fran]] caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was [[Hurricane Isabel|Isabel]] in 2003. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected Northwestern portions of the city.

The I-440 route labeling formerly encompassed the entire loop around the city, co-numbered though South Raleigh with I-40. In 2002, the NCDOT removed the I-440 designation from the co-numbered I-40 (southern and southwestern) sections of the loop, and the directional signage on the remaining I-440 portion was changed from [[Inner/Outer labeling|Inner/Outer]] to East/West. The route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the Inner/Outer designations, especially with Raleigh's new "Outer Beltline," as I-540 has become known. *[[Interstate 540 (North Carolina)|I-540/NC 540]] is currently under development. It is a partially completed outer beltway that will run around the outer edges of Wake County and into a small portion of southeast Durham county. The route is complete and currently open between the [[North Carolina Highway 55|NC 55 Bypass]] interchange Holly Springs and the [[Knightdale Bypass|US-64/US-264]] interchange in suburban Knightdale.  The route is tolled between [[North Carolina Highway 54|NC 54]] in Cary to its current southwestern terminus at NC 55 Bypass.  Completion of the loop is planned (but unfunded), and also contingent upon selection of an agreeable route around the town of [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]]. *[[Interstate 495 (North Carolina)|I-495]], designated in December, 2013.  The route will eventually connect I-440 to I-95 just east of [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]].  It will be concurrent with U.S. 64 for its entire length, following the same roadway as currently exists.  The segment from I-440 to I-540 is signed as I-495, while the segment to the east of I-540 is signed as "Future I-495".  The highway is currently to Interstate standards only along the [[Knightdale Bypass]], which runs from I-440 to the Business 64 exit between [[Knightdale, North Carolina|Knightdale]] and [[Wendell, North Carolina|Wendell]].  East of this point, the road is a controlled access freeway, but does not meet interstate standards.  The "future" designation will be removed as the road is eventually upgraded by improving the road's [[Shoulder (road)|shoulders]], which are currently too narrow to qualify for an Interstate Highway.  There is no set timetable for these improvements.<ref>{{cite web|title=North Carolina Gets a New Interstate, with the I-495 Designation near Raleigh|url=https://apps.ncdot.gov/newsreleases/details.aspx?r=9132|work=NCDOT News Releases|publisher=North Carolina Department of Transportation|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=December 12, 2013}}</ref>  ====[[U.S. Highway system|United States Highways]]==== *[[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|U.S. Route 1]] enters the city from the north along Capital Boulevard, joins I-440 around the west side of Raleigh, and leaves the city to the southwest as the US 1/US 64 expressway in Cary. *[[U.S. Route 64 (North Carolina)|U.S. Route 64]] is the main east-west route through Raleigh; all segments share routes with another highway. East of the city, US-64/US-264 is known as the [[Knightdale Bypass]]. US 64 follows I-440 (as a wrong way concurrency) and I-40 along southern Raleigh, and US 1 to the southwest.  A former alignment, designated as Business US-64, follows New Bern Avenue from the I-440 Beltline to the eastern boundary of the city, where it continues into Knightdale. *[[U.S. Route 70 in North Carolina|U.S. Route 70]] runs roughly northwest-southeast through Raleigh. North of downtown, the route follows Glenwood Avenue into Durham. South of Raleigh, the route (along with US 401 and NC 50) follows South Saunders and South Wilmington Streets into Garner. Through downtown, US 70 uses small segments of several streets, including Wade Avenue, Capital Boulevard, Dawson, and McDowell Streets. *[[U.S. Route 264 (North Carolina)|U.S. Route 264]] cosigned with US 64 through East Raleigh. *[[U.S. Route 401 (North Carolina)|U.S. Route 401]] north of downtown Raleigh it follows Capital Boulevard and Louisburg Road. South of downtown it is cosigned with US 70 from Wade Avenue southward.  ====[[North Carolina Highway System|North Carolina Highways]]==== *[[North Carolina Highway 54|N.C. Route 54]] follows Chapel Hill Road and [[Hillsborough Street]] in West Raleigh. The route ends at its interchange with [[Interstate 440 (North Carolina)|I-440]]. *[[North Carolina Highway 50|N.C. Route 50]] is a north-south route through Raleigh. North of Raleigh it follows Creedmoor Road. NC 50 joins US 70 and later US 401 in downtown Raleigh. The three routes remain together through south Raleigh. *[[North Carolina Highway 98|N.C.

Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.  Raleigh is also served by [[Triangle Transit]] (known formerly as the Triangle Transit Authority, or TTA). Triangle Transit offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]], [[Research Triangle Park]] and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive [[vanpool]] and [[carpool|rideshare]] program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.  [[North Carolina State University]] also maintains its own transit system, the [[Wolfline]], that provides [[zero-fare]] bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.  Government agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.  From 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], and [[Research Triangle Park]], to [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] using [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] with [[light rail]] technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the [[Federal Transit Administration]] declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.  The region's two [[metropolitan planning organization]]s appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |title=Regional Transit Infrastructure Blueprint |publisher=Transitblueprint.org |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2012-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111106111406/http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}</ref>  [[Greyhound lines]] provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, DC, Atlanta, and other cities.  ===Bicycle and pedestrian=== *The Maine-to-Florida [[U.S. Bicycle Route#1]] routes through suburban Raleigh, along with [[North Carolina Bicycle Route 2|N.C.
