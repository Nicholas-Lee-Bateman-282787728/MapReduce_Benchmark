In 2006, Parsippany-Troy Hills was recognized by Money magazine as the 17th-ranked of the Best Places to Live in the United States, the highest-ranked location in New Jersey. In 2008, it moved up to 13th position.Best Places to Live 2006, Money magazine. Accessed August 7, 2006. Parsippany returned to Money Magazine's "Best Places" list in 2012, in the 15th position.

After the Wisconsin Glacier melted around 13,000 BC, half of Parsippany  was filled with water as this was Lake Passaic.  Around the area grasses grew, as the area was tundra and then turned into a taiga/boreal forest as the area warmed. Paleo-Indians moved in small groups into the area around 12,500 years ago, attracted by the diversity of plant and animal life. Native Americans settled into the area several thousand years ago, dwelling in the highlands and along the Rockaway River and the Whippany River, where they hunted and fished for the various game that lived in the area and migrated through the area in autumn.  Paintings in a rock cave were found in the late 1970s in western Parsippany in the highlands. From 1611 to 1614, the Dutch established the colony of New Netherland, which claimed territory between the 40th and 45th parallel north, a zone which included northern New Jersey.  The Native Americans traded furs and food with the Dutch for various goods. In return the Dutch gave the Native Americans metal pots, knives, guns, axes, and blankets. Trading with the Native Americans occurred until 1643 when a series of wars broke out between the Dutch and Native Americans.  There were hostile relations between the Dutch and Native Americans between 1643 and 1660. This prevented colonization by the Dutch of the Morris County region which was technically included in their claimed "New Netherland." On August 27, 1664, three English ships approached Fort Amsterdam and the fort was surrendered to the English. The English now controlled New Netherland and Morris County was now under control of the colony of New York. Relations with the Native Americans improved for a while. There was a war with the Dutch ten years later. The Dutch re-took control of New Amsterdam but after a year returned it to the English. Relations with the Native Americans and English improved for a while English  settlers started to move into the area around 1700.  The Parsippany area had flat land and fertile soil, and a fresh water supply, allowing them to succeed at farming.  All types of game, especially waterfowl  provided colonists a chance to succeed. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 25.394 square miles (65.771&nbsp;km2), including 23.563 square miles (61.029&nbsp;km2) of land and 1.831 square miles (4.742&nbsp;km2) of water (7.21%).

The township has a humid continental climate, with cold winters and very warm-to-hot summers. It is usually cooler than Manhattan at night and in the early morning. The record low temperature is , and the record high is . Parsippany-Troy Hills lies in the Newark Piedmont Basin. Around 500 million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands crashed into proto North America, riding over the North American Plate and creating the New Jersey Highlands, which start in the western portion of the township.  This strike also created land formations in the rest of eastern New Jersey. Around 450 million years ago, a small continent, long and thin, collided with North America, creating folding and faulting in western New Jersey and southern Appalachia. The swamps and meadows of Parsippany were created when the North American Plate separated from the African Plate.  An aborted rift system or half gruben was created.  The land area lowered between the Ramapo Fault in western Parsippany and a fault west of Paterson. The Ramapo Fault goes though western part of the township. The Wisconsin Glacier came into the area around 21,000 BC and left around 13,000 BC due to a warming in climate. As the glacier slowly melted, this created rivers, streams and lakes, leaving most of the township under Lake Passaic, which was the biggest lake in New Jersey at that time, stretching from the edge of the Ramapo Fault in western Parsippany eastward to almost Paterson. The area was first tundra when the Wisconsin Glacier melted and then as the area warmed formed taiga/boreal forests, along with vast meadows. Slowly Lake Passaic drained and formed swamps in the township, such as Troy Meadows, and Lee Meadows on the old Alderney Farm tract are perfect examples.  Due to the fact that there was lowlands next to highlands created a diversity of flora and fauna. Swamps and meadows next to oak forests created a diverse flora and fauna spectrum.
