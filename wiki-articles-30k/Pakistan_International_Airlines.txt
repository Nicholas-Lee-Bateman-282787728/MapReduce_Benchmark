    Pakistan International Airlines () commonly known as PIA or Pakistan International is the national flag carrier airline of Pakistan. It operates scheduled services to 23 domestic destinations and 30 international destinations in 27 countries across Asia, Europe and North America. Its main hubs are Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad/Rawalpindi. Secondary hubs include Peshawar, Faisalabad, Quetta, Sialkot and Multan PIA has a history of milestones in aviation, such as being the first Asian airline to operate a jet aircraft and Boeing 737 aircraft. It is Pakistan's largest airline with a fleet of more than 30 airplanes and at least 10 more on order. Furthermore, PIA is the launch customer of Boeing 777-200LR model. PIA is going through a procedure of privatisation to shift management from government to private sector. It employed nearly 19,000 people as of July 2014. On 4 December 2015, Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC) converted into a new entity called Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL) through a presidential ordinance. Pakistan International Airlines can trace its origins to the days when Pakistan had not yet gained independence from the  British Raj. In 1946, the country's founder Muhammed Ali Jinnah realized the need for a flag carrier for the prospective country and requested financial help from wealthy businessmen Mirza Ahmad Ispahani and Adamjee Haji Dawood for this purpose. Around that time, a new airline 'Orient Airways', was registered in Calcutta on 23 October 1946. In February 1947, the airline bought three DC-3 airplanes from a company in Texas and obtained a license to fly in May of the same year. The airline started its operations in June, offering services from Kolkata to Sittwe and Yangon. On 14 August 1947, Pakistan gained independence and the Orient Airways started relief operations for the new country. It was the first and only Muslim owned airline in the British Raj and flew from 1947 to 1955.     On 6 June 1954, Orient Airways started its operations by offering flight services between East and West Pakistan, with service from Karachi to Dhaka. In addition, the airline also introduced two new domestic routes, i.e., Karachi-Lahore-Peshawar and Karachi-Quetta-Lahore. However, due to sustained losses being suffered by the airline, the Government of Pakistan proposed that Orient Airways merge with a new national airline. On 11 March 1955, Orient Airways merged with the government's proposed airline, becoming Pakistan International Airlines Corporation. The newly formed airline also inaugurated its first international route, Karachi-London Heathrow AirportAbout PIA – History PIA official website. Retrieved 1 August 2010. via Cairo and Rome, using four newly acquired Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellations. The airline continued using DC-3s on domestic routes in Pakistan. In May 1956, PIA ordered two Super Lockheed Constellations of the latest L-1049H type and five Vickers Viscount 815. The appointment of Air Marshal Nur Khan as the Managing Director of PIA in 1959 heralded an era of success for PIA. In March 1960, PIA wet-leased a Boeing 707 from Pan American airlines, thereby becoming the second Asian airline after Air India to induct a jet-aircraft in its fleet, which had purchased Boeing 707-420 in February 1960. With the newly acquired aircraft, the airline introduced its first trans-Atlantic route Karachi-New York Idlewild via London in 1961. In 1962, it expanded its fleet by placing orders for Boeing 720s, Fokker F27s, and Sikorsky helicopters. In the same year, one of Boeing 720s flown by Captain Abdullah Baig flying from London to Karachi established a world record for the Speed over a commercial airline service for powered landplanes of 938.78&nbsp;km/h, a record which still holds to this day. From 1962 to 1966, PIA operated its Sikorsky S-61 helicopters for services within East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh). These were removed in 1966 and a reduced network of eight cities was served by Fokker F27 aircraft. Upon the establishment of ties between Pakistan Government and People's Republic of China, PIA started flying to Beijing in 1964, becoming the first airline of a non-communist country flying to the People's Republic of China. At the outbreak of Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Pakistani Armed Forces used PIA's services for logistics and transport purposes. The Viscounts were phased out in 1966 and were replaced by four Hawker Siddeley Tridents. The 70s was marked by resumption of transatlantic flights, introduction of new destinations, appointment of Nur Khan as its executive for the second term, and the beginning of a financially successful period for the airline. When the political situation in East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh) started deteriorating in early 70s, the Pakistan Army once again used PIA's services to airlift soldiers and ammunition to East Pakistan.  Most flights had to detour to Sri Lanka during trips between West Pakistan and East Pakistan. With the establishment of cordial ties between the Libyan and Pakistani governments in early 70s, PIA added a new international route, Tripoli, to its map in 1972. It also signed an agreement with Yugoslav airline JAT. PIA acquired McDonnell Douglas DC-10s in 1973 and used those planes to replace Boeing 707-300s. In 1974, PIA launched Pakistan International Cargo, offering air freight and cargo services. In 1975, PIA introduced new uniforms for air hostesses which were chosen through an open competition, with the winning entry designed by Sir Hardy Amies, the designer of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The later half of the decade witnessed further expansion of PIA's fleet with the introduction of Boeing 747s through either leased or purchased aircraft. During this decade PIA was regarded as Asia's best airline. For the first time since its inauguration, PIA started providing technical and administrative assistance or leased aircraft to foreign airlines including Somali Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Air Malta and Yemenia. A subsidiary of PIA also started providing hotel management services in United Arab Emirates towards the end of the decade.  The 1980s decade began with the opening of a cargo handling centre at Karachi airport, duty-free shops, the first C and D safety checks on its entire fleet, as well as the introduction of airline's first Airbus A300B4-203 aircraft. In 1984, the airline introduced Night-Coach service as a low-cost alternative to day-time domestic flights. In the following years, PIA Planetarium was inaugurated in Karachi which was followed by planetariums in Lahore and Peshawar. These planetariums featured retired PIA aircraft on display for educational or observational purposes. Two more retired Boeing 720B airplanes were donated to the planetariums in Karachi and Lahore later on. Also in 1985, five new Boeing 737-300s airplanes were introduced in PIA's fleet, making PIA the first Asian airline with such a diverse aircraft fleet. In late 1987 and early 1988, services to Malé and Toronto were introduced. In 1989, Shukria Khanam became the first woman pilot to obtain a license to fly a commercial passenger plane but never joined PIA as a pilot. A year later, First Officer Maliha Sami became the first female pilot of PIA when she took off on Karachi-Panjgur-Turbat-Gwadar route. In the mid-1980s, PIA also helped establish Emirates by leasing two of its airplanes - Airbus A300 and Boeing 737 (737-300) - as well as providing technical and administrative assistance to the new carrier.  In June 1991, Airbus delivered the first of six Airbus A310-300 aircraft. AVM Farooq became the 1st MD of Shaheen Air line and Shaheen Air International as well as Shaheen Cargo and MD Shaheen Air Port services Lahore and remained so until 1993 . With the new airplanes, the airline introduced flights to Tashkent in 1992 and to Zürich in 1993. In March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became MD PIA and also open skies from Karachi to Dubai were declared and 12 private air lines were allowed to operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance. Farooq Umar to meet the challenge, fought the battle of open skies and opened up six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries along with tourists attraction 'air safari'. He also made major changes in routes and schedules and started non stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada. PIA added Jakarta, Fujairah, Baku and Al-Ain to its destinations in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: Sabre, Galileo and Amadeus. 'Air Safari' flights were launched in 1994 using Boeing 737–300 aircraft that used to fly over the Karakoram mountain range. In 1995, 1996 Farooq Umar handed over PIA to another MD March 1996 closing his tenure with great success and leaving PIA profitable with last 6 months profit of more than 55 million PKR. after his departure PIA started to nose dive. PIA purchased a Boeing 747 flight simulator to train its pilots. It also purchased another used Airbus A300 aircraft from Air France. A Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 to cope with surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well. In 1999, PIA leased five Boeing 747–300 aircraft from Cathay Pacific to replace its Boeing 747-200M fleet. The aircraft were painted with a new livery - a handwork Pashmina tail on white body and large Pakistan titles on the front fuselage. The livery was adopted in early 90s but due to some copyright issues it was dropped. The Boeing 747-300s remained in the new look but with a plain green tail with PIA titles. The other aircraft in the fleet were repainted in early 1990s livery.   In July 2002, PIA purchased six Boeing 747-300 aircraft from Cathay Pacific, five of which were already on lease. The sixth one arrived shortly afterwards and was used mainly on its North American and European routes. In October 2002, after a period of ten years without any new orders, the airline placed an order for eight Boeing 777 aircraft from The Boeing Company. The order included all three variants of 777, i.e. three 777-200ER (Extended Range), two 777-200LR (Longer Range) and three 777-300ER versions. PIA was the launch customer that revived the Boeing 777-200LR project that, until then, only had three orders by EVA Air. Boeing delivered the first of three 777-200ER aircraft to PIA in January 2004. PIA introduced a new livery for 777-200ERs airplanes that was applied to most airplanes of its fleet. PIA also leased six more Airbus A310-300/ET planes from Airbus company directly. On 3 November 2005, PIA placed an order to purchase seven ATR42-500 aircraft from ATR to replace its aging fleet of Fokker F27 aircraft. On 6 December 2005, PIA acquired another new Boeing 777-200ER on a ten-year lease from the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). The aircraft was delivered in January 2007 to the airline. On 25 February 2006, Boeing delivered its first 777-200LR to PIA, when it flew from Everett to Islamabad via Manchester. With the induction of long range aircraft in its fleet, PIA started offering non-stop flights from Toronto to Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore from 3 March 2006. PIA had also planned non-stop flights to New York, Chicago, Washington, and Houston but was not given permission by US authorities (unless the airline implemented a European stopover on the flight to American cities). Only the New York flight remains, and it only is nonstop on the way back to Pakistan (from Pakistan to New York the flight stops in Manchester). Washington service ended in the 1990s, Houston services ended in 2006, and Chicago service ended in 2012. ATR delivered two of the seven ordered airplanes by PIA in May and December 2006 respectively, following which the airline ceased using military Lockheed C-130 Hercules for passenger services in northern areas of Pakistan. The military planes were being used after the PIA Flight 688 accident. On 23 December 2006, PIA took delivery of its first Boeing 777-300ER. On 5 March 2007, the European Commission banned all but nine planes of the PIA 42-plane fleet from flying to Europe citing safety concerns of its aging fleet. The ban was imposed following an on-site visit led by Federico Grandini, European Commission’s Air Safety Administrator. The remaining seven, namely the fleet of Boeing 777s, was exempted from the ban.EU bans Pakistan airline flights – BBC News – Obtained 5 March 2007. PIA claimed that the ban was discriminatory and unjustifiable. On 26 March 2007, Tariq Saeed Kirmani was forced to resign after pressure from higher authorities because of the EU ban. Zafar Khan was appointed as the new chairman of Pakistan International Airlines. The ban on the eleven of thirty five aircraft was lifted after a period of four months on 5 July 2007, following an inspection by the European Union Air Safety Administration. Of the eleven aircraft, five were Boeing 747-300s and the remaining six were Airbus A310-300s. On 29 November 2007, the EU completely removed the ban and PIA's entire fleet was permitted to fly to Europe.EU Lifts ban on PIA Brecorder Newspapers. Retrieved 1 December 2007. To avoid such an incident in future, PIA signed a deal to lease seven new Airbus A320-200 from Kuwait-based leasing company ALAFCO. The aircraft were supposed to be delivered during 2008 and 2009 but the deal was cancelled before deliveries. In 2010, PIA altered their livery . They replaced the tail design with a much larger version of the Pakistan national flag, and have added the text "Pakistan international" in gold writing underneath the large billboard style PIA on the fuselage. The green stripe was modified to include gold and has extended to the rear of the fuselage. Most of PIA's fleet will use this livery until 2015, when a new livery will be introduced. In February 2012, PIA ordered 5 more Boeing 777-300ER aircraft with delivery starting in 2015 which will wear a new livery. In 2014, PIA leased 4 Boeing 737-800 from Travel service and Corendon airlines. PIA also published a tender for 4 Boeing 777-300ER. The airline also wanted to lease 4 ATRs. However, the bids for the 777's were not accepted due to bidding standards. Later, The airline managed to lease A320 aircraft, and inducted 2 A320-214 series aircraft in its fleet, first in June and second in July 2014 with 180 all economy seating configuration but in July 2014 aircraft seating was reconfigured as 150 economy and 8 business class seats. Another wet leased A320-211 aircraft from Jordan Aviation joined PIA on August 11, 2014. In October 2014, airline again wet leased three B737-8 aircraft, and it also accepted bids to dry lease five ATR 72-500 series aircraft for eight years period. However, the order of 5 Boeing 777-300ER given in 2012, are postponed up to 2017 because of lack of funds. In 2015, after serving PIA for 16 years, Boeing 747-300 were phased out. Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL)  is majority owned by the Government of Pakistan (87%) while the remainder (13%) by private shareholders. The airline is under the administration of Ministry of Defence the chairman of which is Muhammad Mian Nawaz Sharif . The airline is managed by managing director as well as the Board of Directors. The Board consists of nine independent non-executive members and has four sub-committees: an Audit Committee, Brand and Advertising Committee, Finance Committee, and Human Resource Committee each having its own charter and chairman. The MD leads the executive management of staff who run the airline. The airline's main headquarters are located at Karachi. [ ] Airport while smaller sub head offices are located in several cities within Pakistan. In the late 1990s, the Government of Pakistan considered selling the airline to the private sector due to the persistent losses suffered by the airline. The government announced its privatization plans but they were never implemented. Several steps towards outsourcing of non-core business have been initiated. Catering units (starting with Karachi Flight Kitchen), ground handling (starting with ramp services) and engineering, are to be gradually carved out of the airline and operated as independent companies. During 1997, Pakistan called in a team from International Finance (IFC), the consulting arm of the World Bank, to advise on restructuring and privatization of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). However, no agreement was reached.PIA privatization Flight International Magazine, printed 01-01-1997, assessed 09-03-2009 The government has had many plans for the privatization of the State owned airline. However, no reasonable agreement or solution has been found to this day. On 18 February 2009 the carrier was dropped from the privatization list.Pak Steel, PIA dropped from privatization list The News, Jang Newspapers Published 18-02-2009, assessed 09-03-2009 The following table gives the key financial results for 2011 along with those since 2004 The financial performance for FY 2011 continues to be a challenge with an after tax loss of PKR 26.767 billion. This was preceded by six consecutive loss making years dating back to 2005. The airline did report a reduction of post tax losses of 83% in 2009 (compared to 2008) based on a reduction in fuel cost, comparatively stable exchange rate for the Pakistan Rupee and higher revenues. But in 2011 & 2010, losses again rose sharply compared to the previous years. The airline faces many challenges to its profitability such as staffing levels and overall management issues. An employee count of 18,014 for a fleet of 40 aircraft  is an area for review. To increase revenue, the Prime Minister of Pakistan approved induction of 20 new generation narrow-bodied, four boeing 777-300ER and four ATR-72-500. These aircraft will replace the older fleet of PIA. Currently, A310 consumes $5,500 of oil whereas a 737-900ER would consume $2,500 worth of oil. In addition, with 85% seat factor and 12.5 hours of aircraft usage daily, an addition of 72 billion rupees or 720 million dollars of revenue will be achieved. This will also greatly decreases the employee-aircraft employee ratio which currently sits at 776 per aircraft, one of highest in the world. Moreover, the boeing 777 will be used on long routes instead of short routes. This would help reduce the cost of engine overhaul, which is based on flight cycles. Lastly, 35 employees making 1 million rupees per month will also be audited. In recent years, PIA revenue and source of income has been dropping significantly. In 2010, PIA carried 1,454,000&nbsp;kg of mail. In 2013, PIA managed just 648,000 of mail. Additionally, PIA's revenue from excess baggage, passenger load factor and passenger kilometer flow are among many that have been declining steadily.http://www.piac.com.pk/PIA_About/profiles/2013/Annual-Report-2013_06052014.pdf It is also interesting to note that for 2011, about 81% of revenue is from passenger traffic and only 5% from cargo. Another 7.8% is from room food and beverage sales.The remaining 6% is from excess baggage, charter, engineering services, handling & related services, mail & other.   As of July 2014 PIA serves 30 domestic and 36 international destinations in 28 countries across Asia, Europe and North America from its home bases of Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. Dubai is a major focus city for the airline with flights to Dera Ghazi Khan, Faisalabad, Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Peshawar and Quetta. PIA have codeshare agreements with the following airlines: Pakistan International Airlines fleet includes the following aircraft:     In December 2003 PIA introduced a new image that was applied to its first Boeing 777-200ER and on two newly leased Airbus A310s, one of which was in service. The livery was white at the front and beige at the rear separated by a dark green stripe. The tail was painted white with a new typeface PIA acronym written in dark green. The Pakistan title was added to the front fuselage in all raised letters and the engines were painted in beige colour. The PIA logo written in calligraphic Urdu was added just behind the cockpit. However, due to criticism the design was modified before the first Boeing 777 was delivered. PIA replaced the tail with a flowing Pakistan flag on a beige background. Pakistan titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The engines and Urdu PIA titles remained the same. The leased A310s and most of PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date. In early 2006 the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa and Balochistan. The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name to the rear of the fuselage corresponding to the province. The "Frontier" tail represented the "Phulkari" (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts and linen. The "Punjab" tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore. The "Balochistan" tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, carpets and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern is mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The "Sindh" tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009 management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly. PIA launched its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777–200 and Boeing 747–300 were the first aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model.PIA unveils new livery design for aircraft Daily Times. Retrieved 18-04-2010. The livery consists of a green and gold strip running around the bottom of the fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion is white and at the rear it is an off white/beige colour. The bottom part of the tail blends into the upper fuselage as it is too white, with the rest of the tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green colour. At the front of the fuselage 'PIA' is written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan International' is written in gold. Just behind the cockpit there is a stylized Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines. Underneath, 'Pakistan' is written in bold on the aircraft belly. In July 2014, on delivery of first A320 series aircraft, PIA introduced "crescent and star" on aircraft engines in place of the Urdu PIA logo. In 2015, after the completion of sixty years service to the nation, a retro livery was introduced. Three of the leased A320 (reg. AP-BLA, AP-BLT and AP-BLU) and a Boeing 777-200ER (AP-BMG) were repainted in the airlines 1960s livery.      PIA operates a three-class configuration on its domestic routes: Business, Economy Plus+ and Economy.

PIA has been continuously serving government officials of Pakistan, and has always transported the President and Prime Minister on overseas visits. During the late 1990s, a PIA Boeing 737–300 was used for official visits by the Bhutto and Sharif governments. The aircraft wore official government colours but was later repainted in the airline official colours at the end of the decade. When the government changed after a military coup in 1999, the Boeing 737-300 was transferred to PIA permanently. The President and Prime Minister then resorted to using two of PIA's Airbus A310-300 for official visits, while rare trips were done on regular commercial flights of the airline. In February 2007 the government of Qatar gifted one of their VIP fleet A310 to the Pakistani government, this has ended the need for use of PIA aircraft.
