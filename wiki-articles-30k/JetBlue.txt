    JetBlue Airways Corporation (), stylized as jetBlue, is an American low-cost airline and the 5th largest airline in the United States. The company is headquartered in the Long Island City neighborhood of the New York City borough of Queens, with its main base at John F. Kennedy International Airport. It also maintains a corporate office in Cottonwood Heights, Utah."JetBlue's HQ contest down to NYC, Orlando." Crain's New York Business. Retrieved February 13, 2010"Jetblue 2002 Annual Report." JetBlue. Retrieved January 29, 2009. The airline mainly serves destinations in the United States, along with flights to the Caribbean, The Bahamas, Bermuda, Barbados, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, and many more. As of August 2015, JetBlue serves 97 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, South America, and Latin America.  JetBlue was incorporated in Delaware in August 1998. David Neeleman founded the company in February 1999, under the name "NewAir." Several of JetBlue's executives, including Neeleman, are former Southwest Airlines employees. JetBlue started by following Southwest's approach of offering low-cost travel, but sought to distinguish itself by its amenities, such as in-flight entertainment, TV at every seat, and Sirius XM satellite radio. In Neeleman's words, JetBlue looks "to bring humanity back to air travel." In September 1999, the airline was awarded 75 initial take off/landing slots at John F. Kennedy International Airport and received formal U.S. authorization in February 2000. It started operations on February 11, 2000, with service to Buffalo and Ft. Lauderdale. JetBlue's founders had set out to call the airline "Taxi" and therefore have a yellow livery to associate the airline with New York. The idea was dropped, however, for several reasons: the negative connotation behind New York City taxis; the ambiguity of the word taxi with regard to air traffic control; and threats from investor JP Morgan to pull its share ($20&nbsp;million of the total $128&nbsp;million) of the airline's initial funding unless the name was changed.The Steady, Strategic Ascent of JetBlue Airways January 11, 2006 JetBlue was one of only a few U.S. airlines that made a profit during the sharp downturn in airline travel following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The airline sector responded to JetBlue's market presence by starting mini-rival carriers: Delta Air Lines started Song and United Airlines launched another rival called Ted. Song has since been disbanded and was reabsorbed by Delta Air Lines and United reabsorbed Ted.  In October 2005, JetBlue's quarterly profit had plunged from US$8.1&nbsp;million to $2.7&nbsp;million largely due to rising fuel costs. Operational issues, fuel prices, and low fares, JetBlue's hallmark, were bringing its financial performance down. In addition, with higher costs related to the airline's numerous amenities, JetBlue was becoming less competitive. Regardless, the airline continued to plan for growth. Thirty-six new aircraft were scheduled for delivery in the year 2006. For many years, analysts had predicted that JetBlue's growth rate would become unsustainable. Despite this, the airline continued to add planes and routes to the fleet at a brisk pace. In addition in 2006, the IAM (International Association of Machinists) attempted to unionize JetBlue's "ramp service workers," in a move that was described by JetBlue's COO Dave Barger as "pretty hypocritical," as the IAM opposed JetBlue's creation when it was founded as New Air in 1998. The union organizing petition was dismissed by the National Mediation Board because fewer than 35 percent of eligible employees supported an election. JetBlue experienced its first ever quarterly loss during the fourth quarter of 2005, when the airline lost $42.4&nbsp;million, enough to make them unprofitable for the entire year of 2005. The loss was the airline's first since going public in 2002. JetBlue also reported a loss in the first quarter of 2006. In addition to that, JetBlue forecasted a loss for 2006, citing high fuel prices, operating inefficiency, and fleet costs. During the first quarter report, CEO David Neeleman, President Dave Barger, and then-CFO John Owen released JetBlue's "Return to Profitability" ("RTP") plan, stating in detail how they would curtail costs and improve revenue to regain profitability. The plan called for $50&nbsp;million in annual cost cuts and a push to boost revenue by $30&nbsp;million. JetBlue Airways moved out of the red during the second quarter of 2006, beating Wall Street expectations by announcing a net profit of $14&nbsp;million. That result was flat when compared to JetBlue's results from the same quarter a year before ($13&nbsp;million), but it was double Wall Street forecasts of a $7&nbsp;million profit, Reuters reports. The carrier said cost-cutting and stronger revenue helped it offset higher jet fuel costs. In October 2006, JetBlue announced a net loss of $500,000 for Quarter 3, and a plan to regain that loss by deferring some of their E190 deliveries and by selling 5 of their A320s. In December 2006, JetBlue, as part of their RTP plan, removed a row of seats from their A320s to lighten the aircraft by 904&nbsp;lb (410&nbsp;kg) and reduce the inflight crew size from four to three (per FAA regulation requiring one flight attendant per 50 seats), thus offsetting the lost revenue from the removal of seats, and further lightening the aircraft, resulting in less fuel burned. In January 2007, JetBlue returned to profitability with a fourth quarter profit in 2006, reversing a quarterly loss in the year-earlier period. As part of the RTP plan, 2006's full year loss was $1&nbsp;million compared to 2005's full year loss of $20&nbsp;million. JetBlue was one of the few major airlines to post a profit in that quarter. While its financial performance started showing signs of improvement, in February 2007, JetBlue faced a crisis, when a snowstorm hit the Northeast and Midwest, throwing the airline's operations into chaos. Because JetBlue followed the practice of never canceling flights, it desisted from calling flights off, even when the ice storm hit and the airline was forced to keep several planes on the ground. Because of this, passengers were kept waiting at the airports for their flights to take off. In some cases, passengers who had already boarded their planes were kept waiting on the tarmac for several hours and were not allowed to disembark. However, after all this, the airline was eventually forced to cancel most of its flights because of prevailing weather conditions.JetBlue Airways: Growing Pains? ICMR Case Study. Retrieved November 2, 2010. The fiasco reportedly cost JetBlue $30&nbsp;million.JetBlue fiasco: $30M price tag Retrieved November 2, 2010. In 2007, JetBlue was also facing reliability problems with its Embraer 190 fleet. For a couple months JetBlue contracted ExpressJet to operate four Embraer 145 regional jets on behalf of JetBlue. While this was going on two E-190 aircraft at a time were sent to an Embraer maintenance facility in Nashville, TN. ExpressJet operated routes between Boston Logan and Buffalo, NY and Washington Dulles, and between New York - JFK and Columbus, OH (has terminated) and Richmond, VA. Following the February 2007 incident in which the airline was forced to cancel nearly 1,700 flights due to winter storms, JetBlue's board of directors replaced founder and Chief Executive Officer David Neeleman with Dave Barger. He had politicked the board, while Neeleman was busy publicly apologizing. Barger's ascendancy caused widespread demoralization in the ranks. He became JetBlue's new Chief Executive Officer on May 10, 2007.  Neeleman, the company's founder and largest individual investor, became a nonexecutive chairman as a result of the change. On July 24, 2007, JetBlue reported that its second-quarter revenue increased to $730&nbsp;million, compared to $612 in 2006. Second quarter net income grew to $21&nbsp;million for the quarter, from $14&nbsp;million the previous year. CEO David Barger said the airline will take delivery of three fewer planes this year and will sell three planes from their current fleet, "slowing capacity growth...to strengthen our balance sheet and facilitate earnings growth", but will continue to add two to four new destinations each year. In July 2007, the airline partnered with 20th Century Fox's film The Simpsons Movie to become the "Official Airline of Springfield." In addition a contest was held in which the grand prize would be a trip on JetBlue to Los Angeles to attend the premiere of the film.

On February 20, 2007, JetBlue released an apologetic response to the events that had taken place less than a week before with the creation of their Customer Bill of Rights, which offers financial reciprocation if a customer's flight is delayed or cancelled.Jaffe, By Matthew. "JetBlue Offers Passengers Bill of Rights – ABC News". ABC News. Feb. 20, 2007. Web. Nov. 11, 2010. JetBlue's frequent-flyer program is called TrueBlue. Under the original TrueBlue program, flights were worth two, four, or six points based on distance of the flights, and double points were awarded for flights booked online. In September 2009, JetBlue made changes to its TrueBlue program. In the new program, members receive three points for every dollar spent toward a flight, excluding taxes and fees; members earn an additional three points for every dollar spent on a flight if they book online on the JetBlue.com website. An additional two points are awarded if the member uses JetBlue cobranded American Express credit card to purchase the flight. The price of flights in points depend on the fare of the flight in U.S. dollars. The new program launched on November 9, 2009.JetBlue's Revamped TrueBlue Program Touches Down. Investor.jetblue.com.

In June 2013, JetBlue announced that TrueBlue points will never expire for any reason. The current policy states that if you book a flight on jetblue.com, you earn double with 6 points per dollar. Flights bought elsewhere result in 3 points per dollar spent.  JetBlue has had six incidents involving its aircraft, although none have resulted in any casualties or hull losses.

Kennedy International Airport Long Beach Airport Orlando International Airport September 21, 2005: Flight 292 en route from Burbank, California, to New York City performed an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport (pictured on the right) following a failure of the front landing gear during retraction when it turned 90 degrees. The plane landed after holding for about three hours to burn fuel and lighten the aircraft. The aircraft came to a stop without incident on runway 25L, the third-longest runway at LAX. The only apparent damage to the plane upon landing was the destruction of the front wheels, which were ground down to almost semicircles, and the tires; the front landing strut held. The passengers were unable to see themselves landing despite the DirecTV service in each seat, as it was turned off well before landing.LAX05IA312. Ntsb.gov. Retrieved December 22, 2010.

He then grabbed two beers and exited the plane by deploying the evacuation slide and sliding down it. Slater claimed to have been injured by a passenger when he instructed her to sit down. Slater's account of the event was not corroborated by others.
