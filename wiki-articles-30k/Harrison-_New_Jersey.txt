In June 1671, Nathaniel Kingsland sold the southern third of New Barbadoes Neck (Harrison, East Newark, Kearny and North Arlington) to William Sanford for 200 pounds." In 1755, the first steam engine in North America was set up at the Schuyler Copper Mine in what is now North Arlington to help drain water from the mine.

Accessed December 15, 2011. "Lodi Township was formed March 1, 1826 from area taken from New Barbadoes Township. In 1840 a part of its area was transferred to Harrison Township in Hudson County." Since Lodi Township was part of Bergen County, matters dealing with the county government and courts had to be taken to Hackensack. In 1840, the inhabitants of Lodi Township joined with present-day Secaucus, Bayonne, Jersey City, Hoboken, Weehawken, and Union City and petitioned for the creation of a new county due to the great distance which the petitioners had to travel to reach the county seat in Hackensack.  This appeal resulted in the creation of Hudson County and the first mention of Harrison occurs in the law which was passed on April 13, 1840. Harrison Township was thereby established.Snyder, John P.
