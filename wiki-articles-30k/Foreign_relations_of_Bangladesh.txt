   The foreign relations share the Bangladeshi government's policies in its external relations with the international community. The country pursues a moderate foreign policy that places heavy reliance on multinational diplomacy, especially at the United Nations and World Trade Organization (WTO). Since independence in 1971, the country has stressed its principle of friendship towards all, malice towards none in dictating its diplomacy. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Bangladesh has tended to not take sides with major powers. Since the end of the Cold War, the country has pursued better relations with regional neighbors. Inspired by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's vision for a Switzerland of the East, the Bangladesh government has begun to translate the ideal into a foreign policy that pursues regional economic integration in South Asia and aims to establish Bangladesh as a regional hub of transit trade in Asia. Bangladesh,which was part of British India until 1947, joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1972 after its establishment as an independent nation in 1971. It has actively participated in the Heads of Government conferences that take place bi-annually. Bangladesh was admitted to the United Nations in 1974 and was elected to a Security Council term in 19781980 and again for a 200002 term. Foreign Minister Choudhury served as president of the 41st UN General Assembly in 1986. In recent years, Bangladesh has played a significant role in international peacekeeping activities. Nearly 10,000 Bangladeshi military personnel are deployed overseas on peacekeeping operations, making it a large contributor to the UN peacekeeping forces. Under UN auspices, Bangladeshi troops have served or are serving in Somalia, Rwanda, Mozambique, Kuwait, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Haiti, and units are currently serving in Kuwait and East Timor. Bangladesh responded quickly to US President Bill Clinton's 1994 request for troops and police for the multinational force for Haiti and provided the largest non-US contingent. As of December 2012, Bangladesh is the largest provider of UN peacekeepers. Bangladesh was selected to provide the next chairman of NAM at the summit scheduled for Dhaka 2001, however it was later decided to host the summit at an alternative venue. As a member of the Non-aligned Movement Bangladesh never took any position in line with big powers. However it parted with its principle by voting at the United Nations against North Korea, under pressure from Japan, in December 2008.

Following this participation Bangladesh was admitted as a member of OIC. In 1977, President Ziaur Rahman amended the Constitution of Bangladesh, including a clause stating that " the state shall endeavour to consolidate, preserve and strengthen fraternal relations among Muslim countries based on Islamic solidarity ". Since then, an explicit goal of Bangladeshi foreign policy has been to seek close relations with other Islamic states. In 1980, President Ziaur Rahman was included in a 3-member "Al-Quds" summit committee to attend the summit at Morocco. In 1983, Bangladesh hosted in capital Dhaka the foreign ministers meeting of the OIC. At the OIC headquarters at Jeddah, Bangladesh is represented in the capacity of one of the Director Generals. The government also pursued the expansion of cooperation among the nations of South Asia, bringing the process—an initiative of former President Ziaur Rahman—through its earliest, most tentative stages to the formal inauguration of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) at a summit gathering of South Asian leaders in Dhaka in December 1985. Bangladesh has served in the chairmanship of SAARC and has participated in a wide range of ongoing SAARC regional activities An international organization which includes South Asian and Southeast Asian nations. The member nations of this group are: Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal. The organization focuses on regional economy, regional development and trade & investment. Bangladesh along with the seven other nations are all original members and no plans for expansions have been made. The Developing 8 is an economic development alliance consisting of Muslim majority states which focuses in multiple areas which are rural development, science and technology, banking, agriculture, humanitarian development, energy, environment, health and finance. On May 14, 2006 in Bali, Indonesia, Bangladesh was the only nation not to sign a preferential trade agreement.

The government has participated in numerous international conferences, especially those dealing with population, food, development, and women's issues. In 198283, Bangladesh played a constructive role as chairman of the "Group of 77", an informal association encompassing most of the world's developing nations. It has taken a leading role in the "Group of 48" developing countries. Bangladesh also participates in these international organizations: ARF, AsDB, BIMSTEC, CP, FAO, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICCt (signatory), ICRM, IDA, IDB, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, IHO, ILO, IMF, IMO, Interpol, IOC, IOM, IPU, ISO, ITU, ITUC, MIGA, MINURSO, MONUC, SACEP, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNMEE, UNMIL, UNMIS, UNOCI, UNOMIG, UNWTO, UPU, WCL, WCO, WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WTO, OPCW.

Issue with India stem from teesta and other river water sharing.http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/bangladesh-looks-to-resolve-teesta-water-sharing-treaty-with-india-after-land-boundary-agreement-deal/articleshow/47664870.cms Bangladesh puts deep emphasis on relations with China and the United States as China is the largest military supplier to Bangladesh while United States is one of the largest export markets for Bangladeshi products. In recent years, the relations with Russia also became influential because of the Russian loan and technical assistance on military modernization and the first ever nuclear power plant project of Bangladesh. The bilateral relations of Bangladesh are mainly based on trade activities. However, with certain countries, the relations expand to other areas such as military cooperation, cultural exchange etc. Bangladesh maintains friendly relations with Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka and also India, although there was a border dispute, but with that solved relations between Bangladesh and India are becoming much closer.http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/06/06/bangladesh-india-land-treaty-idINKBN0OM0IV20150606 It strongly opposed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Bangladesh and Nepal recently agreed to facilitate land transit between the two countries. During the Bangladesh Liberation War, the majority of conservative Arab nations were against Bangladeshi liberation because India- a non-Muslim nation was supporting break up of a Muslim country (Pakistan).Non-Arab Muslim nations such as Indonesia and Turkey established relations quickly. In the present, Bangladesh maintains relations to the Middle East through many areas such as commerce, history, military and most importantly religious ties which enabled the two to cooperate more easily then compared to their Western or Far Eastern partners. Bangladesh supplies over 1 million guest workers to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and other Gulf countries. In turn most of Bangladesh's oil is imported from this region. Islamic countries and charities provide economic aid usually to advance the Islamic agenda, including funding mosques and madrassas. During the Yom Kippur War, Bangladesh supported the Arabs and Palestinians and sent a medical team and relief supply which was appreciated. In return they enabled Bangladesh to become a member of NAM at the Algiers Summit in 1973 and pressured Pakistan into recognizing Bangladesh to get Mujib to go to the 1974 OIC Summit in Lahore, as he stated that was his only condition. Bangladesh also took active part in trying to broker a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq during their eight-year war as a member of the United Nations Security Council and participating in the UNIIMOG mission which they became Acting Head of in the last few years before withdrawal. It later helped them to be elected into the OIC Peace Committee. Bangladesh strongly opposed the Israeli bombardment of South Lebanon which killed approximately 1,191 civilians and described it as "State Terrorism" and a double standard conflict going into detail that a non-western nation would have been labelled a terrorist and a western nation would have never been deemed a terrorist. They also contributed to the peacekeeping effort after the 2006 Lebanon War by sending in battalions of infantry.  Bangladesh's presence in Africa is mostly due to their large contribution to the peacekeeping forces present around the continent such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Sudan (Darfur) and Somalia. Bangladesh can foster ties based on its history such as nations in Southeast Africa where there is a South Asian population (whose ancestors immigrated there during the British Empire). In countries such as Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone, Bangladeshi peacekeepers have been honoured. In Sierra Leone, Bengali have been declared a state language. It is currently trying to increase ties with the southern economic bloc in Southern Africa with nations such as Zimbabwe. European countries, particularly from Scandinavia, provide significant economic assistance to Bangladesh.   Bangladesh's relations with the European Union and its member states remained a priority area in the foreign policy context. A number of achievements were made in the economic field during that brief period. At present EU is the top export destination of Bangladesh's products (48% of the total product). The International Jute Study Group—which comprises the EU, Bangladesh, and India—is established in Dhaka. Bangladesh successfully participated in World Apparel Fair, European Seafood Exposition, Bangladesh Trade Show in Moscow and Kiev.

In 1971, the Kingdom of Afghanistan was one of the first Muslim countries to recognize the independence of Bangladesh, along with Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia. They share similar views on international issues such as combating terrorism and increased regional cooperation. A Bangladeshi NGO, BRAC is a part of the reconstruction effort in Afghanistan particularly in microfinance and in 2007 the Afghan ambassador to Bangladesh, Ahmed Karim Nawabi had stated that Afghanistan is interested in recruiting manpower from Bangladesh. Kingdom of Bhutan See Bangladesh–Bhutan relations Along with India, Bangladesh is one of the only two nations to have a residential embassy in Bhutan. The relationship between Bhutan and Bangladesh have always been positive since 1971 when the country was the second to recognize the independence of Bangladesh. The business community in Bhutan are asking for more investment from Bangladesh after a meeting in the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) in Dhaka. Imports from Bhutan.  during the 07-08 fiscal year, Bhutan's imports were worth $10.8million whereas Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan was only worth $0.78million. Republic of India See Bangladesh–India relations , Bangladeshis in India and Indians in Bangladesh Generally relations are usually friendly however government to government contacts are sometimes not too good because of border disputes and river damns problems.http://www.academia.edu/4365028/India-Bangladesh_Relations_Issues_Problems_and_Recent_Developments In 2015 they have exchanged enclaves to help demarcate the border and have agreed to work together and end any irritants to ties like smuggling of cows,border killings,and also river disputes.http://www.internationalpolicydigest.org/2014/08/30/indo-bangladesh-relations-revisited/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/modi-in-bangladesh-land-boundary-agreement-teesta-water-issue/1/442676.htmlhttp://zeenews.india.com/news/india/pm-narendra-modis-bangladesh-visit-%E2%80%93-live-updates_1608345.htmlhttp://newsnextbd.com/bangladesh-india-agree-to-tackle-counterfeit-currency-notes/ India was the second country to recognize Bangladesh as a separate and independent state, doing so on the 6th of December 1971. India helped Bangladeshis during the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1971. Bangladesh's relationship with India has been a difficult in terms of irrigation and land border disputes post 1976. However, Bangladesh has enjoyed favorable relationship with India during governments formed by the Awami League in 1972 and 1996. At the outset India's relations with Bangladesh was strong because of India's support for independence in 1971. During the independence war, many refugees fled to India. India also intervened militarily and helped bring international attention to the issue through Indira Gandhi's visit to Washington, D.C. Afterwards India furnished relief and reconstruction aid. India extended recognition to Bangladesh prior to the end of the war in 1971 (the second country to do so after Bhutan) and subsequently lobbied others to follow suit. India also withdrew its military from the land of Bangladesh when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman requested Indira Gandhi to do so during latter's visit to Dhaka in 1972. Indo-Bangladesh relations have been difficult since the fall of Mujib government in August 1975 over issues such as the Tin Bigha corridor and access to Nepal, the Farakka Barrage and water sharing, border conflicts near Tripura and the construction of a fence along most of the border which India explains as security provision against migrants, insurgents and terrorists. Many Bangladeshis feel India likes to play "big brother" to smaller neighbors, including Bangladesh. Bilateral relations warmed in 1996, due to a softer Indian foreign policy and the new Awami League Government. A 30-year water-sharing agreement for the Ganges River was signed in December 1996, after an earlier bilateral water-sharing agreement for the Ganges River lapsed in 1988. Both nations also have cooperated on the issue of flood warning and preparedness. The Bangladesh Government and tribal insurgents signed a peace accord in December 1997, which allowed for the return of tribal refugees who had fled into India, beginning in 1986, to escape violence caused by an insurgency in their homeland in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. There are also small pieces of land along the border region that Bangladesh is diplomatically trying to reclaim. Padua, part of Sylhet Division before 1971, has been under Indian control since the war in 1971. This small strip of land was re-occupied by the BDR in 2001, but later given back to India after Bangladesh government decided to solve the problem through diplomatic negotiations. In recent years, India has complained that Bangladesh does not secure its border properly. It fears an increasing flow of poor Bangladeshis and it accuses Bangladesh of harboring Indian separatist groups like ULFA and alleged terrorist groups. The Bangladesh government has consistently denied these accusations. India estimates that over 20 million Bangladeshis are living illegally in India. One Bangladeshi official responded that "there is not a single Bangladeshi migrant in India". Since 2002, India has been constructing an India - Bangladesh Fence along much of the 2500 mile border. The failure to resolve migration disputes bears a human cost for illegal migrants, such as imprisonment and health risks (namely HIV/Aids).Fiona Samuels and Sanju Wagle 2011.

Republic of the Maldives See Bangladesh–Maldives relations Maldives as a nation dependent on its tourism sector, they have asked Bangladesh to export manpower to the island state. At the 15th SAARC Summit, Maldives and Bangladesh met at the sidelines to discuss the possibility of sending more semi-skilled and skilled workers. There are already 40,000 workers in Maldives mostly in unskilled and semi-skilled jobs. Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal See Bangladesh–Nepal relations Nepal has good bilateral relations with Bangladesh as they view the latter nation as a great access to the sea giving them the opportunity to develop potential transit and trade facilities and be less dependent on India and China. Nepal recognized Bangladesh on January 16, 1972 and relations further improved after the military coup in August 1975. The turning point for the two nations occurred in April 1976, signing a four-point agreement on technical cooperation, trade, transit and civil aviation. They both seek cooperation in the fields of power generation and development of water resources. In 1986, relations further improved when Bangladesh insisted Nepal should be included on a deal regarding the distribution of water from the Ganges River. Islamic Republic of Pakistan See Bangladesh–Pakistan relations The Bangladesh-Pakistan relationship is yet to be at a level that may be called warm. However, since full diplomatic relations were implemented in January 1976, it has shown improvement in bilateral relations concerning commerce, culture and trade and making reconciliatory agreements. Landmarks in their reconciliation are: Issues need resolving: Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka See Bangladesh–Sri Lanka relations Relations are historically tied together even beyond the sub-continent's colonization by the British. Sri Lanka's first King (to be mentioned in the ancient Pali chronicles) was alleged to have ancestors from the Vanga Kingdom which occupied an area now known as Bangladesh. Bangladesh's Buddhist minority gifted Sri Lanka with a few strands of hair said to have belonged to Buddha as a sign of goodwill. It is a worshiped object on Poya Day, a Buddhist public holiday in Sri Lanka. In August 2008, both Heads of States discussed the implementation of new air links in hope of increasing trade, investment and stronger cultural links. Sri Lanka's current investments have been in Bangladesh's garment and banking sector and expect to diversify into different areas. Bangladesh also hosts a number of Sri Lankan medical students and cricket as a form of friendly communications between their people. Some Sri Lankan Navy officers have studied at the Bangladesh Naval Academy. Country Country (Official Name) Formal Relations Began Notes Nation of Brunei See Bangladesh–Brunei relations They are both members of OIC, the Commonwealth of Nations and NAM and share common views on regional and international issues. Brunei recognized Bangladesh quickly with other Southeast Asian countries (Muslim majority nations like Indonesia and Malaysia in particular) and Bangladesh established residential Diplomatic mission in 1985, although they closed it down in 1988 due to financial constraints. In 1997, Bangladesh reopened its embassy, Brunei has a residential embassy located in Dhaka. Brunei actively supports Bangladesh's candidacy for different regional and international organizations. They supported Bangladesh's United Nation Economic and Social Council 200406 tenure, UNESCO Executive Board from 200307, Governing Board of the ASEAN Organization of the Supreme Audit Institution (ASOSAI) for the 200406 term and membership into the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). Both countries are looking to increase trade & investment such as Bangladesh's pharmaceutical products and Brunei's oil in particular. Brunei also imports manpower from Bangladesh although recently Bangladesh have been asking to take in more manpower especially professionals and to reduce the price of applying to work in Brunei by half (currently it is $1800 per worker from South Asian countries). Education is another part of their relations such as the Brunei Darussalam Government Scholarship for Commonwealth Countries. One Bangladeshi student who wins this scholarship has the opportunity to study at University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD) and Institute Technology Brunei (ITB) to study science based subjects. Students in Brunei have also been able to go to Bangladesh to study at their Medical Colleges and other higher education institutions offering quality education in Asia at a lower cost compared to western nations. Defence relations is improving although Bangladesh are expecting more trainee officers in the future. Every year Brunei sends its personal for training in Defence Services Command and Staff College and other Military institutions. Defence officers from Bangladesh can also visit Military institutions in Brunei although it is only optional. Both countries have agreed to increase air links between the two countries which have already signed two agreements in 2004 and 2006 resulting in Bangladesh granting 5th freedom traffic rights with "intermediate" and "beyond" like Singapore and Dubai. Direct air links could cut travel time between the two countries by more than half, benefiting the 10,000 Bangladeshis working in Brunei. Both countries have set up a joint committee primarily to discuss the current bilateral relations and how it can improve although they can discuss international issues with mostly similar views on.

Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste See Bangladesh–East Timor relations Republic of Indonesia See Bangladesh–Indonesia relations Indonesia along with other non-Arab Muslim countries such as Malaysia, Turkey and Afghanistan immediately recognized Bangladesh. Relations have gone into different areas such as trade & investment, cultural exchange and peacekeeping. Indonesia is the world largest Muslim country in terms of its population, whereas Bangladesh is the fourth largest Muslim country.  Indonesia and Bangladesh are partners in Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Developing 8 Countries. Bangladesh has an embassy in Jakarta, whereas Indonesia has an embassy in Dhaka. Since the official bilateral relations were established in 1972, both countries enjoy cordial and friendly relations. Indonesia have recently signed a deal with a pharmaceutical company called Eskayef Bangladesh Ltd. to export its goods to their country where Bangladesh sees another potential market for its pharmaceutical products. Lao People's Democratic Republic See Bangladesh–Laos relations The relations between Laos and Bangladesh is cordial. Malaysia See Bangladesh–Malaysia relations Malaysia was one of the first Muslim states along with Indonesia to recognize Bangladesh and since then the two have seen a rapid growth of cooperation between them. Malaysia offers economic and technical assistance, trade and investment while Bangladesh offers a cheap labor workforce for areas such as construction. Malaysia is the largest ASEAN investor in Bangladesh and Malaysian companies have invested $1.3 billion in 59 projects in 2007 in areas such as telecommunications, textiles and financial sector. However the trade balance is overwhelmingly in Malaysia's favor, during the 200607 fiscal year, exports were a mere $16.9 million compared to $384.16 million in imports. Trading between the two nations are increasing especially in pharmaceutical exports with a number businesses are calling for a Free Trade Agreement to balance out the trade deficit. Many Malaysian companies have shown keen interest to participate in infrastructure projects here such as power generation, sea port development, waste disposal system, construction of roads and highways as well as in the service sector such as education and healthcare. Malaysia said will continue to contribute positive efforts to promote and expand bilateral relations with Bangladesh, particularly in trade and investment. Pending projects like the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, worth $1.2 billion, power generation, port development etc. would be completed. In 2008, Malaysia and Bangladesh signed a memorandum of understanding regarding exchange of information to combat money laundering. The signatories are the financial intelligence units of the central banks of both nations. Bangladesh and Malaysia are also members of Developing 8, OIC, the Commonwealth of Nations, Like Minded Group and Non-Aligned Movement show that the two have similar views on regional and international issues. Issue of labor force administration in Malaysia has somewhat strained the bilateral ties temporarily. In 2007 Malaysia banned imports of Bangladeshi workers into the country after hundreds of them were stranded at an airport because their employers failed to collect them. There were demonstrations in Kuala Lumpur by Bangladeshi workers demanding payments and better conditions. This created a crisis in the bilateral ties but issue has been resolved with the interference of the governments. The government had placed a similar restriction in 1999 but lifted the ban in 2011 by approving an initial intake of 300,000 workers. Republic of the Union of Myanmar See Bangladesh–Burma relations Bilateral ties with Burma are good, despite occasional border strains and an influx of more than 270,000 Muslim refugees (known as "Rohingya") from predominantly Buddhist Burma. As a result of bilateral discussions, and with the cooperation and assistance of the UNHCR, most of the Rohingya refugees have now returned to Burma . As of 2000, about 22,000 refugees remain in camps in southern Bangladesh.

Other Heads of States like Ershad visited in 1985, 1988 and 1990 and Thaksin Shinawatra in July and December 2002 and January 2004. Thailand is a key country in Bangladesh's "Look East" policy and relations have begun to increase and diversify into different areas. They seek not to intervene in each other's internal matters as shown by their response to the events occurring in their own respective countries in 2006 such as the 2006 Thai coup d'état and 2006–2008 Bangladeshi political crisis. Both have considerable cooperation in summits organized by BIMSTEC and the ASEAN regional forum. Upper class and upper middle class Bangladeshis often go to Thailand for medical treatment and operations that the country's medical infrastructure cannot provide. Socialist Republic of Vietnam See Bangladesh–Vietnam relations After Bangladesh gained independence in 1971, it had strongly supported North Vietnam's struggle with the US and strongly opposed the bombing of North Vietnam which was demonstrated by nationwide movements.

Mongolia See Bangladesh–Mongolia relations Democratic People's Republic of Korea See Bangladesh–North Korea relations Due to their pro-China administration, North Korea did not establish ties until China recognized and established relations with Bangladesh in 1974. There is a North Korean embassy located in Dhaka although Bangladesh maintains a non-residential status. Instead communication between the Juche state and Bangladesh is with the latter's embassy in Beijing. Relations have only gone as far as recognition and neither nation has ever desired to progress this even further, especially due to the increase in military cooperation between Bangladesh and South Korea and North Korea's isolationist policies. In 2006, Bangladesh have used its ties with North Korea, urging them to comply with a UN resolution after North Korea's missile launch during a meeting with then Japanese Foreign Minister, Taro Aso. Republic of Korea See Bangladesh–South Korea relations Relations are considered to be productive and progressive. Their relations have gone on to expand in several areas such as defence and trade & investment. Bangladesh also sends a large number of skilled migrant workers to South Korea to work in the following sectors:- construction, manufacture, services, and agriculture, fisheries and livestock. Bangladesh and South Korea's Olympic organizations signed an agreement which would benefit Bangladesh's sports development.

As Bangladesh had mutual relations with the Soviet Union, the former intended to increase cooperation after the collapse, especially amongst the new Muslim majority nations. As Bangladesh have begun increasing production of pharmaceutical goods, melamine, garments and jute products other nations have become increasingly interested such as Kyrgyzstan whose Ambassador Orolbaeva Irina Abdyevna have said this could help strengthen bilateral ties. Other areas including education have been mentioned, with a demand of increasing educational exchange. President Iajuddin Ahmed had said with the increasing standards of higher education especially in engineering, medical, science and technology, he stated Kyrgyz students can benefit studying in Bangladesh's educational facilities. Kyrgyzstan's expertise in hydroelectricity can also help with Bangladesh's growing energy problem.http://www.bangladeshjournal.com/article/Business/171/ Republic of Kazakhstan See Bangladesh–Kazakhstan relations Republic of Tajikistan See Bangladesh–Tajikistan relations Turkmenia See Bangladesh–Turkmenistan relations Republic of Uzbekistan See Bangladesh–Uzbekistan relations Country Country (Official Name) Formal Relations Began Notes Kingdom of Bahrain See Bahrain–Bangladesh relations Republic of Iraq See Bangladesh–Iraq relations Iraq was the first Arab nation to recognize the independence of Bangladesh. Bangladesh and Iraq have missions located in Baghdad and Dhaka. Iraq closed down theirs after the Iraq War began but after a six-year lapse appointed a new ambassador in October 2007. Bangladesh and Iraq's ties are primarily based on common faith but there has not been much progression into areas such as trade and investment. Between 1980 and 1986, Iraq sent five officers to study in Bangladesh's military academy in Dhaka. The only notable visit between the two nations was Saddam Hussein's visit to Bangladesh in 1988. The height of Bangladesh-Iraq relations was during the 1980s due to Bangladesh's role in trying to call for a ceasefire between Iraq and Iran during their war and was a part of UNIIMOG. Relations quickly deteriorated after Iraq invaded Kuwait sparking the Gulf War and a huge rise in oil prices. Bangladesh responded to the UN resolution demanding Iraq withdraw by the deadline or face military action. Bangladesh's other reasons for participation was because of the Bangladeshi community in Kuwait who some work on oil rigs and Kuwait is Bangladesh's oil supplier. Bangladesh joined the UN coalition to liberate Kuwait. Relations between Baghdad and Dhaka would later improve after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 when Bangladesh declined to send troops to Iraq despite America's persistence and stating that the UN should have had a primary role in solving the matter before the war. Currently they want a complete withdrawal from Iraq and has expressed support for reconstruction efforts. The public in Bangladesh have repeatedly held large demonstrations against the war. Islamic Republic of Iran See Bangladesh–Iran relations Immediately after the independence of Bangladesh, many non-Arab nations quickly recognized the new country. However, due to the strong pro-US attitude of the Shah and helping to transport weapons to West Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Iran, however, established diplomatic relations with independent Bangladesh in early 1972. A turning point in relations was during the Iraq-Iran War when Bangladesh as a UN Security Council member tried to broker a ceasefire between the nations and settle their disputes with dialogue. Eventually, Bangladesh would participate in UNIIMOG mission to observe that agreements such as a ceasefire had been honored. In 1995, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani became the first President of Iran to visit Bangladesh. The current president, Hassan Rouhani is looking to strengthen relations with countries in South Asia such as Bangladesh by increasing Iranian investment like building oil refineries. In return, Bangladesh is supporting Iran's rights to its Nuclear Program for Peaceful Purposes. In 2006, both countries signed a preferential trade accord which removes non-tariff barriers, hoping to take it further to a free trade agreement and in 2007, Bangladesh has requested Iranian assistance on building its nuclear power plant and to import raw fish. Both countries are members of Developing 8 Countries, OIC, Like Minded Group. They have generally similar views on world issues especially on the occupation of Palestine. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan See Bangladesh–Jordan relations Sultanate of Oman See Bangladesh–Oman relations State of Qatar See Bangladesh–Qatar relations Israel See Bangladesh–Israel relations Bangladesh does not recognize Israel. even though Israel was one of the first nations to recognize Bangladesh. It has called for an end to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and for the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Bangladesh has a complete ban on trade (indirect and direct) with Israel even though both are members of the WTO. As Bangladesh does not have any diplomatic relations with Israel, it is not permitted for Bangladeshis to travel to Israel using a Bangladesh passport, which brought about the arrest of journalist Salah Choudhury. In the immediate aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon War Bangladesh offered to send battalions of its infantrymen to help with the UN peacekeeping force, however Israel opposed it stating Bangladesh does not recognize Israel. Although Israel rejected the country's participation, Bangladesh and Nepal were the first countries whose troops reached the shores of South Lebanon. As of 3 December 2015 Bangladesh has 285 personal participating in UNIFIL in Lebanon. Lebanese Republic See Bangladesh–Lebanon relations Ties between the two are based on common background such as religious tolerance, the need to tackle Islamic militancy, similar views on global events and common religion. Bangladesh opposed Israel's bombing of South Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War and offered to contribute approximately 2,000 troops to the peacekeeping force. As of 3 December 2015 Bangladesh has 285 personal participating in UNIFIL in Lebanon. Bangladesh Navy has also contributed a vessel to  the UNIFIL Maritime Task Force (MTF) in Lebanon. Bangladesh like other South Asian countries also send workers to Lebanon to work in domestic and manual jobs, although many like those in the Gulf states complain of harsh conditions and low wages. During the 2006 Lebanon War, some of the Bangladeshis returned home but some went unpaid as their employers escaped the conflict by traveling abroad. Palestine See Bangladesh–Palestine relations Relations between Bangladesh and Palestine are considered to be warm and cordial as Bangladesh advocates for an independent Palestinian state and an end to Israeli occupation. Bangladesh is one of the 135 countries to recognize Palestine as a state since the Palestinian Declaration of Independence on November 15, 1988. The first high-level meeting between the two was in 1974 at the second OIC summit in Lahore, Pakistan between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Yasser Arafat. Since then there have been high level contact such as Yasser Arafat's visits in 1981 and 1987 who was warmly received by both former presidents Ziaur Rahman and Hossain Mohammad Ershad with favorable media coverage. Later when democracy returned to Bangladesh, Arafat was also received warmly by Prime Ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina. There is a wide public support for an independent Palestine as the Government had reported in 1987 that 8,000 had volunteered for the PLO although there had never been any official moves to send weapons or personnel. However, it has been reported that some Bangladeshis have traveled to Lebanon to join Palestinian battles against Israel. Since the 1980s, under IMET (International Military Education and Training) there have been development of military ties between the PLO and Bangladesh with the former attending one year courses at the Bangladesh Military Academy in Chittagong. Palestine is represented in Bangladesh by the Embassy of the State of Palestine in Dhaka. Bangladesh also provided material help to establish the diplomatic mission. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia See Bangladesh–Saudi Arabia relations Early relations between Riyadh and Dhaka where somewhat dormant owing to the former capital's country's close bond with Pakistan. From mid-1970s onward Bangladesh was seeking closer ties with oil rich Arab states such as Saudi Arabia. After the 1982 coup by Ershad, he visited Riyadh to meet with the King. Nine months later a ten-member delegation of the Saudi military arrived in Bangladesh to discuss possible military ties and inspect its facilities.Since 1981, Saudi Arabia has sent 100 officers to the Defense Services Command & Staff College in Dhaka, which is the college's largest number of overseas graduates from a single nation. Bangladesh is seeking to increase economic ties with Saudi Arabia to reduce the trade deficit currently in the Kingdom's favor. One of their proposals is to export ceramics, leather and pharmaceutical products to the Kingdom as they are already doing with the western nations. Syrian Arab Republic See Bangladesh–Syria relations Republic of Turkey See Bangladesh–Turkey relations Bangladesh-Turkey relations have been excellent since Turkey recognized Bangladesh in 1971, soon after independence. The trade volume between the two countries have grown as did Bangladeshi exports and has been in Bangladesh's favor throughout their economic relationship. The present bilateral trade (2011) is more than US$1 billion. The two countries also have institutionalized cooperation in areas of investment, customs, health, defense, agriculture, education, air service, tourism and culture. Bangladesh and Turkey cooperate with each other at the multilateral forum, particularly in matters related to elections. In the recent years, Turkey and Bangladesh have supported each other in several forums, including at the ITU, IMO, CEDAW, HRC, etc. Turkey would support Bangladesh's 201617 candidature to the UN Security Council while Bangladesh would support Turkey's 201516 candidature to the UNSC.

After Bangladesh began sending its diplomats to the Arab world such as Libya to explain their view of the war, they immediately recognized and established diplomatic relations with Bangladesh. Bangladesh opened its embassy in Tripoli on January 8, 1975. Cooperation between the two countries is primarily in international forums such as the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Bangladesh has expressed interest in increased economic ties, and specifically in exporting pharmaceutical products to Libya.

The relationship between Bangladesh and Sudan thickened as UN Peacekeeping Mission manned by Bangladeshi military started to work in Sudan in 2007. Bangladesh agreed to sending 1,600 of its personal and urgently needed helicopters to join the UN peacekeeping force in Darfur.

Federal Republic of Germany See Bangladesh–Germany relations After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, East Germany was the third country in the world, and the first country in Europe, to officially recognize Bangladesh in 1972. Bangladesh also warmly greeted German reunification. As an economic power as well as an important member of the European Union (EU), Germany is a reliable partner of Bangladesh in development cooperation. Since independence, German churches and numerous non-governmental organizations (NGOs) made tremendous efforts to promote the social and economic development of Bangladesh. German assistance to Bangladesh is received in the form of development efforts, trade and cultural cooperation. Both countries have a long and successful bilateral relationship on most international issues. Germany always emphasizes the democratic characteristics, governance issues and development process of Bangladesh. After establishment of diplomatic relations, the bilateral relations between the two countries began to grow steadily. Between the start of development cooperation in 1972 and the end of 2005, Bangladesh received approximately €2.3 billion in commitments from Germany as part of bilateral financial and technical cooperation, in addition of the funds provided by the German churches and NGOs. At an intergovernmental negotiation in 2005, Bangladesh received €14 million in new commitments from Germany. Since 1978, all German funds provided as part of government level cooperation have been in the form of non-repayable grants. Bangladesh is a priority partner country of German Development Cooperation (GTZ). By an agreement between both the government adopted in May 2004, the activities of the GTZ focus on three priority areas such as healthcare including family planning, economic reform and development of the market system through promotion of private sector, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and renewable energies. Among the other ongoing projects the promotion of legal and social empowerment of women in Bangladesh is also to be mentioned. The sustainable economic development program of GTZ in Bangladesh contributes to the competitiveness of the ready-made garments (RMG) sector, as well as other export-oriented sectors like silk, leather and jute. In trade with Germany, Bangladesh has for years recorded a large surplus. Germany is the second largest export market of Bangladesh after the US. Bangladesh exports in Germany in 2006 amounted to €1.56 billion as compared with Bangladesh imports in the same period of only €305 million. About 94% of the exports from Bangladesh to Germany are RMGs and Bangladesh imports mainly comprising machinery, chemical and electrical goods, and medicines. A German-Bangladeshi investment promotion and protection agreement has been in force since 1986 and a bilateral double taxation accord since 1993. So far German direct investments in Bangladesh are almost €60 million. The Bangladesh-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BGCCI) acts as a business platform and mediator between both the countries. The cultural relationship of both the countries is very strong. The cultural cooperation between them is mainly channeled through the Goethe Institute that work on developing the cultural ties between both the countries by sponsoring local and German cultural activities. Bangladesh has traditional and historical connection with Germany. There is a century-old exchange between German and Bengali people. German interest in the culture of Bengal dates back to the visits to Germany by the Bengali national poet and Nobel laureate for literature Rabindranath Tagore in the 1920s and 1930s. Many Bangladeshi intellectuals take a keen and informed interest in German literature, art, architecture and philosophy. In Bangladesh Goethe Institute is the main meeting place for all those interested in Germany. Goethe-Institute Dhaka with headquarters in Munich offers a broad variety of cultural events to present the German culture in Bangladesh through its main activities by film-workshops, film-presentations, seminars and lectures on socio-political subjects as well as on aspects on contemporary arts, theatre performances, and exhibitions of German and Bangladeshi artists. Bangladesh has traditional and historical connection with Germany, and both the countries enjoy closest ties. There are increasing contracts amongst German and Bangladeshi artists, primarily in the fine arts, photography/film and theatre. Bangladeshi artists have been able to exhibit in German galleries and museums. A number of visual artists from Bangladesh have also made Germany their new home. Germany continues to promote the restoration of historical monuments, archeological research and the unique legacy of the Bengali catamarans. Since 1981, a cooperation agreement has been in place between Radio Bangladesh and Deutsche Welle (DW). The bilateral commercial and trade interests of both the countries are continuing, although there is considerable scope for greater engagement. Bilateral relations got some momentum by several high level visits, contracts, and political and economic dialogue. In December 2000, the then head of the government of Bangladesh officially visited Germany. In February 2004, a German nine-member parliamentary delegation also visited Bangladesh. Both Germany and Bangladesh share common views on various international issues and work together in the UN and in other international forum. They have maintained and developed close and friendly relations in a wide range of field. The two countries are harmonized together by their commitment to various sectors mutually agreed upon, which is expected to be strengthened further in future.
