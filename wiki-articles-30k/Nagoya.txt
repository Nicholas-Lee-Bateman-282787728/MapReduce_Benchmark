    is the largest city in the Chūbu region of Japan. It is Japan's third-largest incorporated city and the fourth most populous urban area. It is located on the Pacific coast on central Honshu. It is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and is one of Japan's major ports along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, Chiba, and Kitakyushu. It is also the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan region, known as the Chūkyō Metropolitan Area. As of 2010, 2.27 million people lived in the city, part of Chūkyō Metropolitan Area's 9.10 million people. The city's name was historically written as 那古野 or 名護屋 (both read as Nagoya). One possible origin is the adjective , meaning 'peaceful'. [ ] The name Chūkyō (中京, consisting of chū (middle) + kyō (capital)) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Chūkyō include the Chūkyō Industrial Area, Chūkyō Metropolitan Area, Chūkyō Television Broadcasting, Chukyo University and the Chukyo Racecourse. Oda Nobunaga and his protégés Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers () away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya. During this period Nagoya Castle was constructed, built partly from materials taken from Kiyosu Castle. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle. Around the same time, the nearby ancient Atsuta Shrine was designated as a waystation, called Miya (the Shrine), on the important Tōkaidō road, which linked the two capitals of Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). A town developed around the temple to support travelers. The castle and shrine towns formed the city. During the Meiji Restoration Japan's provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889 and designated a city on September 1, 1956 by government ordinance. Nagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called karakuri ningyō. Mitsubishi Aircraft Company was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there. Nagoya was the target of US air raids during World War II. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193,194,198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during World War II. Air raids began on April 18, 1942 with an attack on a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant.The First Heroes by Craig Nelson The bombing continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale [[firebombing]]. Nagoya was the target of two of [[Bomber Command]]’s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated {{convert|5.9|mi2|1|abbr=out|disp=flip}} . The [[XXI Bomber Command]] established a new [[U.S. Army Air Force]] record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission—3,162 tons of incendiaries. It also destroyed or damaged twenty-eight of the numbered targets and raised the area burned to almost one-fourth of the entire city.<ref>21st Bomber Command, Tactical Mission Report NO. 44, ocr.pdf, March 20, 1945.</ref>{{Full|date=April 2012}} Nagoya Castle, which was being used as a military command post, was hit and mostly destroyed on May 14, 1945.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nucrbGjY_GoC&pg=PA200&lpg=PA200&dq=nagoya+bombing&source=bl&ots=9tlAhszPyD&sig=HD6F1I5ush1AN0iQ_XhZSt9Zpf4&hl=en&ei=S3o9S6OSNZWekQX0n_XvCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CCAQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=nagoya%20bombing&f=false|title=Apocalypse Undone|author=Preston John Hubbard|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|year=1990|page=199}}</ref> Reconstruction of the main building was completed in 1959.  In 1959, the city was flooded and severely damaged by the [[Ise-wan Typhoon]].  == Geography == [[File:Nobi Plain and Nagoya from Mount Sanpo 2008-9-24.jpg|thumb|View of the Nōbi Plain, [[Kiso Three Rivers]] and Nagoya from Mount Sanpo and Mount Yoro]]  Nagoya lies north of [[Ise Bay]] on the [[Nōbi Plain]]. The city was built on low-level [[plateau]]s to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The [[Kiso River]] flows to the west along the city border, and the [[Shōnai River]] comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made [[Hori River (Nagoya)|Hori River]] was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Shōnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at Ōdaka into the bay.  The city's location and its position in the [[Chūbu region|centre of Japan]] allowed it to develop economically and politically.  ==Wards== [[File:Nagoya Wards.png|thumb|A map of Nagoya's Wards]]  Nagoya has 16 [[Wards of Japan|wards]]: {{Div col}} * [[Atsuta-ku, Nagoya|Atsuta-ku]] * [[Chikusa-ku, Nagoya|Chikusa-ku]] * [[Higashi-ku, Nagoya|Higashi-ku]] * [[Kita-ku, Nagoya|Kita-ku]] * [[Meitō-ku, Nagoya|Meitō-ku]] * [[Midori-ku, Nagoya|Midori-ku]] * [[Minami-ku, Nagoya|Minami-ku]] * [[Minato-ku, Nagoya|Minato-ku]] * [[Mizuho-ku, Nagoya|Mizuho-ku]] * [[Moriyama-ku, Nagoya|Moriyama-ku]] * [[Naka-ku, Nagoya|Naka-ku]]—administrative center * [[Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya|Nakagawa-ku]] * [[Nakamura-ku, Nagoya|Nakamura-ku]] * [[Nishi-ku, Nagoya|Nishi-ku]] * [[Shōwa-ku, Nagoya|Shōwa-ku]] * [[Tempaku-ku, Nagoya|Tempaku-ku]] {{Div col end}} {{Clear}}  ==Climate== Nagoya has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'') with hot summers and cool winters.

The [[Hōsa Library]] dates to the 17th century and houses 110,000 items, including books of classic literature that are an heirloom of the [[Owari Tokugawa]] and were bequeathed to the city. The [[Nagoya City Archives]] store a large collection of documents and books. [[Tsuruma Central Library]] is a public library and [[Nagoya International Center]] has a collection of foreign-language books.  == Culture== {{Refimprove section|date=September 2013}}  Nagoya was a major trading city and political seat of the Owari lords, the most important house of the Tokugawa clan. They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially [[Tokugawa Muneharu]], the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal [[Edo period]] and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.  === Museums === [[File:Tokugawabijutsukan1.JPG|thumb|The Tokugawa Art Museum, which houses some of the finest art treasures of Japan]] [[File:Toyotasangyoukinen5.JPG|thumb|Textile Machinery Pavilion in the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology]] [[File:Liniatetsudoukan.JPG|thumb|SCMaglev and Railway Park]] Nagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.  Nagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era. The main tower is a museum that details the history of the castle and the city. The Honmaru Palace, destroyed in World War II, is slated for reconstruction by 2016 and will again be a prime example of the ''[[Shoin-zukuri]]'' architecture of the feudal era. [[Tokugawa Art Museum]] is a private museum belonging to the Owari Tokugawa, who lived in Nagoya castle for 16 generations.  Among other things, it contains 10 designated [[national Treasures of Japan]], including some of the oldest scrolls of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yamasa.org's Tokugawa Art Museum page |url=http://www.yamasa.org/japan/english/destinations/aichi/tokugawa_artmuseum.html}}</ref> The Nagoya Noh Theatre houses various precious objects of [[Noh theatre]]. The [[Nagoya City Museum]] showcases the history of the town.  Paintings and sculpture are exhibited at the [[Nagoya City Art Museum]]. Modern art is displayed at the [[Aichi Arts Center]]. The Aichi Arts Center also is the venue of rotating exhibitions. The city is also home to the [[Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], a sister museum to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], which was founded to bring aspects of the MFA's collection to Japan.  The art of [[porcelain]] and ceramics can be seen at the [[Noritake Garden]]. Toyota has two museums in the city, the [[Toyota Automobile Museum]] which shows vintage cars, and the [[Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology]], which showcases company history, including its start as a [[textile mill]].  The [[Nagoya City Tram & Subway Museum]] has trams and subway cars, as well as the [[Nagoya City Science Museum]]. The [[SCMaglev and Railway Park]] opened in March 2011 with various trains from the Central Japan Railway Company.  Other art museums in Aichi prefecture are the [[Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum]] and the [[Toyota Municipal Museum of Art]]. [[Meiji Mura]] is an open-air museum with salvaged buildings from the Meiji, Taisho and Showa eras.  Other museums in the city include the [[International Design Centre Nagoya]], the [[Japan Spinning Top Museum]] and the [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Money Museum]].  === Theatres === [[File:Aichi Arts Center.jpg|thumb|Aichi Arts Center in Sakae]]  [[Noh]] theatre and [[Kyōgen]] date back to the feudal times of the Owari Tokugawa. The [[Nagoya Noh Theater]] at Nagoya Castle continues that tradition and is a prominent feature in the cultural life of the city, with monthly performances.  One of Japan's [[Kabuki]] grand stages is [[Misono-za]], which also hosts various other Japanese entertainment such as concerts.  In 1992, the large, modern [[Aichi Arts Center]] was opened in Sakae. It is the main venue for [[performing art]]s, featuring a main hall that can be used for [[opera]] and theatre and a concert hall. The [[Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra]] performs there, as well as many visiting guest orchestras.  === Cultural path === The civic authorities promote tourism and have taken steps to safeguard architectural heritage by earmarking them as cultural assets. Apart from the castle, temples, shrines and museums in the city, a "Cultural Path" was instituted in the 1980s, located between the Tokugawa Art Museum and Nagoya Castle. This residential area has historic buildings such as the Nagoya City Archives, the Nagoya City Hall main building, the Aichi Prefectural Office main building, the Futaba Museum, the former residence of Sasuke Toyoda, the former residence of Tetsujiro Haruta and the Chikaramachi Catholic Church. Most buildings date from the Meiji and Taisho era and are protected.  === Festivals === [[File:Osu-2008 Oiran-dochu-02.jpg|thumb|''Daidō-chōnin Matsuri'' in [[Ōsu]]]] [[File:Nagoyamatsuri7.JPG|thumb|[[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]](Nagoya Festival)]] [[File:Tokugawaendashizoroe1.JPG|thumb|Tsutsui-chō/Dekimachi tennōsai]] Apart from the main national [[Japanese festivals|festivals]] and holidays, other [[festivals in Nagoya|festivals]] are unique to the city/region.  Major events include the June Atsuta Festival, the July Port Festival, the August Nagoya Castle Summer Festival Castle and the October Nagoya Festival. Wards and areas host local festivals such as the {{Nihongo|''Daidō-chōnin Matsuri''|大須大道町人祭|Street Performer's Festival}} in Ōsu.  === Dialect === The {{nihongo|[[Nagoya dialect]]|名古屋弁|Nagoya-ben}} is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called {{Nihongo|Owari dialect|尾張弁|Owari-ben}}. The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to [[Japanese language#Official status|standard Japanese]] and to the [[Kansai dialect]], differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.  === Handicrafts === The industry of [[Japanese handicrafts]] in the city is centuries old.  * Arimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from [[Bungo Province]] in [[Kyushu]], known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6–12 months to complete. * ''[[Geta (footwear)|Geta]]'' [[Clog (shoe)|clog]] straps: wooden clogs called ''geta'' were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet. * ''Shippo'': the technique for [[enamelware]] called ''shippo'' arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery. * Candles: [[wax]] is taken from a [[wax tree]] and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (''[[washi]]'') over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the [[Candle wick|wick]] tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.   * ''Yuzen'': the art of [[silk]] dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured. * ''Sekku Ningyo'': festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era.

The name is said to have come from a Chinese medicine that resembled it in colour. It is assumed that the medicine was brought by Chinese medicine vendors to Japan before the 15th century. * ''Tenmusu'': [[onigiri|rice ball]] wrapped in [[laver (seaweed)|laver]] with [[tempura]] at the centre. This dish originated in [[Tsu, Mie|Tsu]] and became popular in Nagoya. * ''Moriguchi pickles'': pickles made of ''Moriguchi [[daikon]]''.
