   The 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, formerly called the 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate) – nicknamed the Arkansas Brigade or the Bowie Team – is a infantry brigade combat team of the United States Army made up of soldiers from the Arkansas Army National Guard. The 39th IBCT was one of fifteen National Guard brigades designated as an enhanced separate brigade. Brigades with this designation received higher levels of training, more advanced equipment, and higher troop levels than normal National Guard brigades. It also made these brigades a self-contained combat unit capable of intelligence, reconnaissance, maneuver, fire support, combat service support, and command and control without having to require attachments or detachments during deployments. In 2005, it was converted to the standard modular IBCT design as part of Army transformation. The 39th IBCT is the largest National Guard command in Arkansas. It is headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas. It was placed in federal service on 12 October 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II. The 39th was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division and served in and around Baghdad for a year, returning to the United States in March 2005. In late August 2005, after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States, elements of the 39th, then commanded by Colonel Mike Ross, were among the first military units to provide recovery and relief efforts to citizens of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 39th led the effort to evacuate an estimated 16,000 people from the New Orleans Convention Center. The 39th Brigade completed its second deployment to Iraq in December 2008, after spending a year on active federal duty. Unlike the last deployment to Iraq from 2004–2005, the 39th Brigade headquarters did not have command and control of all of its subordinate units. During World War I, an infantry brigade from the 20th Infantry Division was organized as the 39th Brigade from October 1918 to February 1919 consisting of the 48th and 89th Infantry Regiments, however this unit has no connection to the current 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.McGrath, John J. (2004). The Brigade: A History: Its Organization and Employment in the US Army. Combat Studies Institute Press. ISBN 978-1-4404-4915-4. p.167 The main antecedent of today's brigade was the 39th Infantry Division, created in 1917, which consisted of troops from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas. The division shipped to France, August – September 1918. It was then sent to the St. Florent area, southwest of Bourges, where it was designated as a replacement division and several of the units were transferred to combat divisions.GlobalSecurity.org, Military, Agencies, Army, III Corps, 7th Infantry Division, 39th Infantry Bde, 2–153rd Infantry Battalion, "Gunslinger".

In the years between the World Wars, the division headquarters was deactivated, but its Arkansas elements continued as part of the Arkansas National Guard. These former 39th Division elements were activated independently for WWII. For a history of their participation, see the article on the 153rd Infantry Regiment and the 206th Coast Artillery. The 39th Infantry Division was reconstituted on 30 September 1946. It was composed of units from Arkansas and Louisiana, with its headquarters stationed at New Orleans, Louisiana and the Arkansas portion headquartered in Little Rock Arkansas. During this period the division included the 153rd Infantry Regiment, the 156th Infantry Regiment, and the 206th Artillery Regiment. In 1967 the division was redesignated as the 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate) and in 1973 was paired with the US 101st Airborne Division as a training partner and became an air-assault brigade. The following Regiments were represented in the 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate): 153rd Infantry Regiment, 151st Cavalry Regiment and the 206th Field Artillery Regiment. In 1994 the 39th was again reorganized and gained its designation as an "enhanced" brigade. In 1999, the 39th became part of the 7th Infantry Division under the Army Integrated Division concept which paired National Guard and Reserve brigades with active duty headquarters and support units.Global Security.org, 39th Infantry Brigade (Light) (Separate/Enhanced). Retrieved 21 January 2010, http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/39in-bde.htm In 2006, the 7th Infantry Division was deactivated and the 39th IBCT was placed under the command and control of the 36th Infantry Division (United States) (Texas National Guard). On 2 November 1967 in accordance with National Guard Bureau Memo NG-AROTO 1002-01, the 39th Infantry Division was reorganized and redesignated as the 39th Infantry Brigade.http://www.first-team.us/journals/39th_bde/39_ndx03.html  This change resulted in a massive restationing within the state as follows: 39th Brigade units conducted numerous overseas training rotations throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.1967–2002, 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate), The Arkansas Brigade, 35 Years of Excellence, A Brief History of the 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate) Company B, 2nd Battalion, 153 Infantry, and Company B, 3rd Battalion, 153rd Infantry of the 39th BCT were activated for Operation Southern Watch, May through September 1999.Global Security.

Chastain Company B, 3rd Battalion, 153rd Infantry was the first National Guard unit since the Vietnam War to be involuntarily mobilized by presidential order (President Bill Clinton). The unit was mobilized to support operations in Operation Southern Watch. The 3rd BN Commander was LTC Ewing, B Company Commander was CPT Rozenberg and the company first sergeant was 1SG Nutt. B Company consisted of over 120 soldiers from the Camden and Fordyce units and volunteers from other areas of south and central Arkansas. The unit primarily provided security for two active duty Army Patriot missile batteries in Saudi Arabia. The units conducted initial training for the deployment in Camp Robinson Arkansas and 7th ID in Fort Carson Colorado. The success of the mission laid the ground work for additional deployments of National Guard units. In March 2001, Company D, 1–153rd and Company D, 3–153rd deployed to Bosnia as part of the Multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR), Security Force Nine in order to assist with the enforcement of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH). The companies were attached to 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division for the deployment as part of Task Force Eagle. They performed presence patrols outside Forward Operating Base Morgan and Camp McGovern, and participated in the consolidation of weapon storage sites. The soldiers also guarded the sites. On 8 October 2001, 2–153 Infantry was activated.Global Security. Org, 2–153rd Infantry Battalion "Gunslinger". Retrieved 12 January 2010. http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/2-153in.htm Second Battalion was sent to Egypt in order to take over the Multinational Force and Observers mission, freeing up regular army infantry units to deploy to Afghanistan. The 2-153's mission during the MFO was: "...to supervise the implementation of the security provisions of the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty of Peace and employ best efforts to prevent any violation of its terms." This mission was accomplished by carrying out four tasks: operating checkpoints, observation posts and conducting reconnaissance patrols on the international border as well as within Zone C; verification of the terms of the peace treaty not less than twice a month; verification of the terms of the peace treaty within 48 hours, upon the request of either party, and ensuring freedom of international marine navigation in the Strait of Tiran and access to the Gulf of Aqaba. This was the first "pure" National Guard takeover of the MFO mission. 2-153 Infantry deactivated on 11 October 2002. The 39th Infantry Brigade was notified in 2002 that it would be participating in a rotation to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, LA. For National Guard brigades, a rotation is actually a three-year process that provides additional money, resources and training opportunities in order to improve unit readiness before the actual rotation through the JRTC. The brigade was required to complete a mission rehearsal exercise during the 2003 annual training which was conducted at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. Less than a month after the completion of this major training milestone, the brigade received its alert for deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom on 28 July 2003. On 12 October 2003, the brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Ronald ChastainBIO of BG Chastain. Retrieved 19 January 2009, http://www.chastaincentral.com/content/ron.html (now Major General retired), was ordered to federal service in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II for a period of up to 18 months. The brigade conducted post mobilization training at Fort Hood, Texas from October 2003 until January 2004. In January the brigade shipped its vehicles and equipment to Iraq from Fort Hood, and then moved to Fort Polk for a Mission Rehearsal Exercise at the JRTC. While there, on 17 February 2004, President George W. Bush visited the 39th and had an MRE (Meal, Ready-to-Eat) lunch in a field mess tent with soldiers. After lunch, President Bush made brief remarks to the soldiers. When the brigade received its alert, it was approximately 700 soldiers short of its authorized end strength. This shortage was due in large part to the way new recruits are accounted for in the National Guard. In the active Army a new recruit only comes to a unit and is counted on its books after the soldier has completed Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training. In the National Guard, the new recruit is counted on the unit's strength reports as soon as the Soldier signs their contract. The brigade had over 500 soldiers who had not completed either Basic or Advanced Individual Training upon alert. This shortage led to the decision to consolidate the available manning into two infantry battalions that would be supplied for the brigade by the Arkansas National Guard and to ask the National Guard Bureau to provide the third infantry battalion. Because of the 2002 deployment of the 2-153 Infantry Battalion to the MFO, the battalion was deemed non-deployable as an organization, however the soldiers of the battalion were to deploy. The decision was made by BG Chastain to transfer the battalion commander and staff from 2–153 IN to 3–153 Infantry. The 3-153 IN commander and staff were transferred to 2–153 and were designated to function as the brigade's rear detachment during OIF II. This transfer led to the 3-153 IN often being referred to as the two thirds (2/3) battalion by members of the 39th BCT. 3–153rd IN adopted the 2–153rd IN's nickname and call sign, "Gunslingers" for OIF II. National Guard Bureau met the brigade's need for additional soldiers by alerting 2nd Battalion, 162nd Infantry, from the Oregon National Guard; a platoon of Company B, 1st Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard; a platoon of Company C, 1st Battalion, 102nd Infantry Regiment from the Connecticut National Guard; the 1115th Transportation Company and elements of the 642nd Maintenance Company from the New Mexico Army National Guard;  elements of 629th Military Intelligence Battalion from the Maryland National Guard; elements of HHSC, 233rd Military Intelligence Company, California National Guard; and, Battery A, 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery, Rhode Island National Guard to round out the brigade and bring it to its full deployment strength of 3700 soldiers. With the addition of Company A, 28th Signal Battalion, from the Pennsylvania National Guard, the 39th Brigade included National Guard soldiers from ten states. The 39th Brigade's mission during Operation Iraqi Freedom was to conduct full-spectrum operations focused on stability and support operations and to secure key terrain in and around Baghdad, supported by focused and fully integrated information [IO] and civil-military operations, in order to enable the progressive transfer of authority to the Iraqi people, their institutions and a legitimate Iraqi national government. The lines of operation as established by 1st Cavalry Division included:Restoring Essential Services In Baghdad During Operation Iraqi Freedom II, Colonel L. Barrett Holmes, The U.S. Army War College combat operations; train and equip security forces; essential services; promote governance; and, economic pluralism, with information operations interconnected throughout. The end state envisioned by Maj. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli of these full spectrum operations was a secure and stable environment for Iraqis, maintained by indigenous police and security forces under the direction of a legitimate, national government that is freely elected and accepts economic pluralism. The 39th Infantry Brigade relieved the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division in the Baghdad neighborhoods of Adhamiyah and Rusafa as well as elements of 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division at Camp Taji.

The 39th BCT was instrumental in the January 2005 elections. The brigade was responsible for the establishment and security of 20 different polling sites within the brigade's area of operations. In order to avoid jeopardizing the credibility of the election process, it was necessary to avoid a Coalition Force presence at the polling sites. This meant that the security at the polling sites would be the responsibility of the New Iraqi Army units for which the 39th was responsible. 39th Brigade leaders spent countless hours planning and coordination with Iraqi counterpart units and governmental elections officials, and not one polling site in the 39th BCT area of operations was disrupted or forced to close.DA Form 7594, Unit Award Recommendation, Meritorious Unit Award Recommendation submitted by 3rd Battalion, 153rd Infantry for OIF II The members of the brigade's 239th Engineer Company stationed in Camp Cooke and their families back in Arkansas were the subject of a TV documentary series that aired on the Discovery Times channel called Off To War.

The day’s events started with the "39th Brigade Combat Team Fallen Heroes Memorial Ride" where over two thousand motorcyclists rode from the Clear Channel Metroplex in Little Rock to the front of the State Capitol. Chief Warrant Officer Three (CW3) Dennis Bradley of Benton, Arkansas, had the concept for the memorial while the 39th Infantry Brigade was still in Iraq and opened the memorial event. SGT Tammy Holman of Little Rock sang the National Anthem, followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by SPC James Carter. Chaplain (COL) David McLemore of Russellville, who served with the 39th in Iraq, offered the opening prayer. The honored guests for the memorial program were the family members of those who died. Over 100 relatives of the honored soldiers were present. Brigadier General Ron Chastain, who commanded the 39th while in Iraq, Major General Don C. Morrow, the Adjutant General of the Arkansas National Guard, and Secretary of State Charlie Daniels were the featured speakers for the memorial program. Colonel Mike Ross of North Little Rock served as the master of ceremonies for the memorial event.

Prior to the event, Secretary of State Daniels hosted a reception in the old Supreme Court Chamber in the State Capitol for the family members of the lost soldiers of the 39th. Upon redeployment in 2005, the 39th Brigade immediately began a major reorganization that transformed the brigade from an enhanced separate brigade (ESB) to an infantry brigade combat team (IBCT) under the United States Army's new Modular Design. This redesign of the army was intended to make the force more easily deployable by making brigades more self contained and less dependent on support organizations at the division level. Major changes for the 39th Brigade included: Along with this reorganization came a significant re-stationing of several units within the state of Arkansas. After Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in August 2005, elements of the 39th deployed to New Orleans by C-130s from the Little Rock Air Force Base to support the relief and recovery efforts as part of Operation Katrina.New Orleans: post-Katrina violence was exaggerated, Bill Wineburg.

Once again the brigade found itself with a shortage of personnel to fill these taskings. Many of these shortages were caused by unresolved medical issues from the first deployment. This time the Arkansas National Guard decided not to ask for outside support, but met the brigade's need for personnel by task organizing the 217th Brigade Support Battalion from the 142nd Fires Brigade, and three companies from the 87th Troop Command to the 39th Brigade for this deployment.

Retrieved 14 January 2010. http://www.nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2007/1214nj1.htm This allowed the unit to perform certain tasks in Arkansas and allowed unit members to be closer to their families for a longer period of time. The brigade was placed in federal service in January 2008 and trained at Camp Shelby, Mississippi until it deployed to Iraq beginning in March 2008. Upon reaching their final destinations, most of the brigade elements fell under the tactical command (TACON) of Regular Army units, primarily the 4th Infantry Division and the 3rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary). The 39th BCT and its subordinate battalions retained administrative control (ADCON) of all brigade elements. While deployed in Iraq from April to December 2008, the headquarters of the 39th IBCT assumed the mission as the base defense operations cell (BDOC) for Victory Base Camp (VBC) in Baghdad, Iraq, responsible for the security of over 65,000 coalition soldiers and civilians.DA Form 7594, Unit Award Recommendation, Meritorious Unit Award Recommendation submitted by HHC, 39th IBCT for the period 1 April 2008 through 1 December 2008  With this mission, the BCT headquarters managed and coordinated the security of four subordinate camps and Area Defense Operation Centers (ADOCs), to include: Camp Victory, Camp Striker, Camp Slayer, and Camp Liberty. The BCT headquarters managed entry control and personnel processing at four major entry control points (ECPs) and processed over 2,500 local national workers each day. In addition to internal base security, the BCT managed terrain outside the perimeter in order to better provide defense in depth, as well as improve quality of life for Iraqi population centers adjacent to VBC. These responsibilities also included the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) that was located in the center of VBC. The BCT, in partnership with its subordinate units, coordinated nearly ten million dollars in projects that benefited local Iraqi communities. During this same time period, the BCT invested over twenty-one million dollars in base defense improvement to VBC, to include improved towers, barriers, fencing, perimeter lighting, road improvement, water projects, and general force protection initiatives. The 39th IBCT was also charged with providing command and control for the Counter-RAM, Joint Intercept Battery, a system used to destroy incoming artillery, rockets and mortar rounds in the air before they hit their ground targets. For their efforts, the Headquarters, 39th IBCT received the Meritorious Unit Citation (MUC) from the Commander, 4th Infantry Division. The 39th IBCT's task organization for the BDOC mission was: Task Force 1–153rd consisted of a Headquarters Company, a Joint Visitor's Bureau Company, a Personal Security Detachment Troop and two Base Defense Companies. The task force was responsible for the force protection and defense of Camp Slayer and the Radwiniya Palace Complex within the Victory Base Camp. The TF 1–153rd searched over 10,000 cars and 35,600 Iraqis to ensure no threats penetrated the perimeter. Soldiers assigned to TF 1–153rd executed 996 combat patrols in the area of operations surrounding Camp Slayer and captured six high-value targets. TF 2–153rd was stationed in Al Asad Airbase, Iraq and was organized as a convoy security battalion. The battalion provided convoy security to theater sustainment convoys using the Jordan Line of Communications from Trebil to Al Asad and Forward Operating Base TQ. The unit conducted seventy six combat logistical patrols, four to six days in length, driving over 1,587,000 miles. TF 2–153rd experienced one casualty during OIF 09-09 when an escort vehicle was accidentally struck while providing security at an intersection by one of the escorted vehicles. Task Force 1–151st CAV, based at Tallil Airbase, consisted of over 800 soldiers assigned to six companies/troops/batteries consisting of active and reserve components. TF 1–151st CAV conducted over 700 tactical convoy security missions, without losing a single soldier due to enemy activity. The task force was responsible for long haul fuel mission between Tallil Air Base, Logistical Base Sitz, Taji and Balad Air Base. TF 1–151st CAV suffered one non-combat related casualty when a soldier died while working on a vehicle in the motor pool. The Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 1–206th Field Artillery was assigned to function as the Garrison Command Cell at Camp Taji, Iraq. The 39th Brigade Deputy Commanding Officer, COL Kirk Van Pelt accompanied the 1–206th to Taji and acted as the Garrison Commander. The organic units of the 1–206th FA were attached to various battalions in the 1st Sustainment Brigade as convoy security companies. Batteries A and B and Company G, 39th BSB were tasked to escort convoys of concrete barriers to Baghdad during the Siege of Sadr City. The "Clear, Hold, Build Concept" as it was employed in Sadr City involved cordoning several city blocks by emplacing  concrete barriers around the area to be sealed off. These barriers weighed several tons each, so an entire convoy might move only 30–40 barriers. The convoy escort team would escort the civilian trucks hauling the barriers from Camp Taji or Camp Liberty to Sadr City, and then provide security on the site for up to six hours while cranes lifted and emplaced each barrier. These missions often came under small arms fire and the threat of improvised explosive devices was constant. The 1–206th FA suffered no killed in action during this second deployment, although Battery B had one killed in action from an attached Regular Army unit. SGT Jose Ulloa, of 515th Transportation Company was killed on 8 August 2008 went the MRAP that he was riding in was struck by an improvised explosive device during a convoy security mission in Sadr City, Baghdad.Stars and Stripes, Mideast edition, Wednesday, 13 August 2008, Mannheim Service Member killed in Baghdad, Steve Mraz.

The 39th BCT redeployed to Camp Shelby, Mississippi in December 2008 and demobilized. Unlike the first deployment, the soldiers of the 39th were supported by a massive reintegration effort. Soldiers and their families participated in Yellow Ribbon reintegration events at the thirty, sixty and ninety day post redeployment intervals. The soldiers and their families were provided with lodging at convention centers around the state for these events. The soldiers were presented with information on Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR), employment counseling, marriage counseling, Veterans Affairs benefits, post traumatic stress disorder and suicide prevention. Each event included a job fair to assist soldiers in finding employment. The service of several of the brigade's units has been recognized by unit awards: The 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate) was authorized a brigadier general for a commanding officer until 2005 when the brigade was reorganized as a modular brigade combat team, at which time the commanding officer's grade was downgraded to colonel.flyer entitled "39th Infantry Brigade (Separate), Arkansas Army National Guard, Thirtieth Anniversary, 1967–1997, The Arkansas Brigade, Celebrating 30 years of Service to our State and Nation, 6 December 1997, Earl T.

Retrieved 19 January 2009, http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Inf/39InfantryBrigade.htm The Bowie knife symbolizes the state of Arkansas, where the Bowie knife originated, and close hand-to-hand fighting which is the specialty of the light infantry. The diamond is a reference to a unique aspect of the state of Arkansas which has the only diamond field in North America in Murfreesboro, Arkansas. The red and blue colors are the colors of the Arkansas flag and represent both their loyalty (blue) and the blood (red) that its soldiers have shed for both the state of Arkansas, and the United States in its operations. The brigade motto is "Courage". The ultimate symbol of the 39th Brigade Combat Team is the Bowie knife that adorns the brigade patch and is worn by certain field grade officers and command sergeants major in the brigade.Arkansas 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Bowie Edition, Volume 07-12, Bringing a Knife to a Gunfight, page 36 The most famous version of the Bowie knife was designed by Jim Bowie and presented to Arkansas blacksmith James Black in the form of a carved wooden model in December 1830. Cumpston, Mike ( 1 April 2007). "The American Excalibur (sic): Jim Bowie's lethal legacy". Guns Magazine. Retrieved 2008-07-21, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_4_53/ai_n27161901  Black produced the knife ordered by Bowie, and at the same time created another based on Bowie's original design but with a sharpened edge on the curved top edge of the blade. Black offered Bowie his choice and Bowie chose the modified version. Knives like that one, with a blade shaped like that of the Bowie knife, but with a pronounced false edge, are today called "Sheffield Bowie" knives, because this blade shape became so popular that cutlery factories in Sheffield, England were mass-producing such knives for export to the U.S. by 1850, usually with a handle made from either hardwood, deer antler, or bone, and sometimes with a guard and other fittings of sterling silver.Cumpston, Mike ( 1 April 2007). "The American Excalibur (sic): Jim Bowie's lethal legacy". Guns Magazine. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_4_53/ai_n27161901. Retrieved 21 July 2008. Bowie returned, with the Black-made knife, to Texas and was involved in a knife fight with three men who had been hired to kill him.Pacella, Gerard (2002), 100 Legendary Knives, Iola, USA, Krause Publications, 145. ISBN 0-87349-417-2  Bowie killed the three would-be assassins with his new knife and the fame of the knife grew. Legend holds that one man was almost decapitated, the second was disemboweled, and the third had his skull split open.  Bowie died at the Battle of the Alamo five years later and both he and his knife became more famous. The fate of the original Bowie knife is unknown; however, a knife bearing the engraving "Bowie No. 1" has been acquired by the Historic Arkansas Museum from a Texas collector and has been attributed to Black through scientific analysis. Black soon did a booming business making and selling these knives out of his shop in Washington, Arkansas. Black continued to refine his technique and improve the quality of the knife as he went. In 1839, shortly after his wife's death, Black was nearly blinded when, while he was in bed with illness, his father-in-law and former partner broke into his home and attacked him with a club, having objected to his daughter having married Black years earlier. Black was no longer able to continue in his trade. Black's knives were known to be exceedingly tough, yet flexible, and his technique has not been duplicated. Black kept his technique secret and did all of his work behind a leather curtain. Many claim that Black rediscovered the secret of producing true Damascus steel. In 1870, at the age of 70, Black attempted to pass on his secret to the son of the family that had cared for him in his old age, Daniel Webster Jones. However, Black had been retired for many years and found that he himself had forgotten the secret. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas. The birthplace of the Bowie knife is now part of the Old Washington Historic State Park which has over forty restored historical buildings and other facilities including Black's shop. The park is known as "The Colonial Williamsburg of Arkansas". The American Bladesmith Society established the William F. Moran School of Bladesmithing at this site to instruct new apprentices as well as journeyman, and mastersmiths in the art of bladesmithing. As described in the 39th Anniversary Brigade Annual, published for the 39th Brigade's 39th anniversary celebration in 2006 at the brigade headquarters in Ricks Armory, Little Rock, Arkansas, the Bowie knife has been the individual weapon of senior leaders in the brigade since the creation of the brigade in 1967."39th Infantry Brigade (Separate), Arkansas Army National Guard, Thirtieth Anniversary, 1967–1997, The Arkansas Brigade, Celebrating 30 years of Service to our State and Nation, 6 December 1997, Earl T. Ricks National Guard Armory Only knives that are procured by order of the brigade commander are authorized for wear or presentation. The handle of the knife is commensurate with the leader's rank:Arkansas 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Bowie Edition, Volume 07-12, Bringing a Knife to a Gunfight, page 37 The knife is worn on a pistol belt on the bear's left side with the Army Combat Uniform. The brigade Bowie knife has been worn by members through two deployments in support of OIF II. The knife continues to be produced in Arkansas. Until his death, each presentation-grade knife was handmade by Mr. Jimmy Lile of Russellville, Arkansas. Mr. Lile was also commissioned to make the knives made by Sylvester Stallone in the "Rambo" movies. The Lile family continued to make the "Bowie knife" for the brigade for several years following Mr. Lile's death. Today the brigade's knife is produced by Mr. Kenny Teague of Mountainburg, Arkansas. The general public cannot purchase one of these knives, but can purchase a different style based on the Bowie knife pattern. Each brigade Bowie knife bears the recipient's name, social security number, rank, and military branch, as well as the maker's name and serial number of the knife. The stars stand for France, Spain, and the United States, the countries to which the Arkansas Territory belonged. The diamond shape was suggested by the state flag, while the wavy bar symbolizes the Arkansas River with the arrow referring to the Indian name "Arkansa." The Green background alludes to the wooded hills of the Ouachita and Ozark national forest. The arrow in flight is used as a symbol of the brigade defending the state.
