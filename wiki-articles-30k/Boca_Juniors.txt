     Club Atlético Boca Juniors () is an Argentine sports club based in the La Boca neighbourhood of Buenos Aires.

Boca Juniors' international achievements also include Tie Cup,Cup Tie on RSSSF Copa de Honor CousenierHonor Cup on RSSSF and Copa Escobar-Gerona,Copa de Confraternidad Escobar&nbsp;– Gerona on RSSSF organized jointly by the Argentine and Uruguayan Associations. Boca Juniors is also one of only eight teams to have won CONMEBOL's treble. Their success usually has Boca ranked among the IFFHS's Club World Ranking Top 25, which they have reached the top position six times (mostly during the coaching tenure of Carlos Bianchi). Boca was also named by the IFFHS as the top South American club of the first decade of the 21st century (2001–2010). Boca Juniors is also known to be the most popular football club in Argentina, due to its fanbase being composed of approximately 40% of the total population of the country."O mais grande" by Sergio Maffei, Olé, 6 Feb 2008 Boca has always had a fierce rivalry with River Plate, as both clubs were established in La Boca. Matches between them are known as the Superclásico, and are one of the most heated rivalries in Argentina and the world, as both clubs are the two most popular in the country. Boca's home stadium is Estadio Alberto J. Armando, which is colloquially known as La Bombonera. The youth academy has produced many Argentine internationals such as Oscar Ruggeri, Sebastián Battaglia, Nicolás Burdisso, Carlos Tevez, Éver Banega, and Fernando Gago, who have played or are playing for top European clubs. In addition to football, Boca Juniors also has professional basketball and volleyball teams. Other (amateur) activities held in the club are: athletics, futsal, artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, martial arts (judo, karate and taekwondo), swimming, weightlifting and wrestling."Deportes amateur" at club website   On 3 April 1905, a group of Italian boys (more specifically from Genoa) met in order to find a club. The house where the meeting was arranged was Esteban Baglietto's and the other four people who attended were Alfredo Scarpatti, Santiago Sana and brothers Juan and Teodoro Farenga. In 1913, Boca obtained the promotion to Primera División that the team had wanted for many years. This was possible when the Asociación Argentina de Fútbol decided to increase the number of teams in the league from 6 to 15. In 1925, Boca made its first trip to Europe to play in Spain, Germany and France. The squad played a total of 19 games, winning 15 of them. For that reason Boca was declared "Campeón de Honor" (Champion of Honour) for the 1925 season by the Association. During successive years, Boca consolidated as one of the most popular teams of Argentina, with a huge number of fans not only in Argentina but worldwide. The club is one of the most successful teams in Argentine football, having won 31 Primera División titles, second only to River Plate with 36. In South American and international club football, Boca Juniors have won 18 titles, the same as A.C. Milan; although Boca also won four international official titles (played between teams from the Argentine and Uruguayan Associations, although not recognized by FIFA yet. Those honors include 1919 Tie Cup, 1920 Copa de Honor Cousenier and 1945 and 1946 Copa Escobar-Gerona. According to the club's official site, the original jersey colour was a white shirt with thin black vertical stripes, being then replaced by a light blue shirt and then another striped jersey before adopting the definitive blue and gold. Nevertheless, other version states that Boca Juniors' first jersey was pink, although it has been questioned by some journalists and historians who state that Boca, most probably, never wore a pink jersey, by pointing out the lack of any solid evidence and how this version stems from, and is only supported on, flawed testimonies. Legend has it that in 1906, Boca played Nottingham de Almagro. Both teams wore so similar shirts that the match was played to decide which team would get to keep it. Boca lost, and decided to adopt the colors of the flag of the first boat to sail into the port at La Boca. This proved to be a Swedish ship, therefore the yellow and blue of the Swedish flag were adopted as the new team colours. The first version had a yellow diagonal band, which was later changed to a horizontal stripe.   The club has had five different designs for its badge during its history, although its outline has remained unchanged through most of its history. In 1955, laurel leaves were added to celebrate the club's 50th anniversary, and the colours were changed to match those on the team's jersey. In 1970, one star was added to the badge for each title won domestically (at the top, above the initials) and internationally (at the bottom). A new star is added to the corresponding section whenever Boca wins a title, currently standing at 52. 1920 1955 1960 1970 1995–present   Boca Juniors used several locations before settling on their current ground on Brandsen. Club's first ground was in Dársena SurCien años de multitud: El período amateur (1905–1930) by Horacio D. Rosatti&nbsp;– Ed. Galerna, 2008&nbsp;– ISBN 9789505565405 of the old Buenos Aires port (currently Puerto Madero) but it was vacated in 1907 as it failed to meet the minimum league requirements. Boca Juniors then used three grounds in the Isla Demarchi area between 1908 and 1912."Breve historia de la isla Demarchi" on La Nación, 30 Ago 2012 In the first year in the Primera Division (1913) the club hadn't an own stadium and played the home games in the pitches of the other teams, likely in Estudiantes de Buenos Aires en Palermo (en Figueroa Alcorta y Dorrego), but also in Avellaneda (first official derby against the River).http://viejosestadios.blogspot.it/p/darsena-sur.html Between 1914 and 1915, the club moved away from La Boca for the second time in its history (beyond the 1913), moving to Wilde in the Avellaneda Partido of the Greater Buenos Aires but a relatively poor season and poor attendances in 1915 forced the club to move back to La Boca. On 25 May 1916, Boca Juniors opened its new stadium at the intersection of Ministro Brin and Senguel streets, playing there until 1924 when the club moved to its current location on Brandsen and Calle Del Crucero (current Del Valle Iberlucea) streets."La Bombonera" on Planeta Boca Juniors Building of Boca Juniors' current stadium began in 1938, under the supervision of Engineer José L. Delpini. Boca played its home matches in the Ferro Carril Oeste ground in Caballito until it was completed in May 25, 1940. A third level was added in 1953, originating then its nickname La Bombonera ('The Chocolate Box'). The stand opposite the Casa Amarilla railway platforms remained mostly undeveloped until 1996, when it was upgraded with new balconies and quite expensive VIP boxes. Three sides of the Bombonera are thus made up of traditional sloping stadium stands, but the fourth side was built vertically, with several seating areas stacked one on top of the other, the only way that makes it stand into the club premises. La Bombonera is renowned for vibrating when fans start to jump in rhythm; in particular, the unique vertical side will sway slightly, leading to the phrase, "La Bombonera no tiembla. Late" (The Bombonera does not tremble. It beats)"Tiembla la Bombonera" on El Observador, 12 Dec 2014"Crespo: La Bombonera tiembla, es muy fuerte" on Cancha Llena, 11 Jan 2013 La Bombonera currently has a capacity of around 49,000. The club's popularity make tickets hard to come by, especially for the Superclásico game against River Plate. There are further improvements planned for the stadium, including measures to ease crowd congestion, use of new technology and improved corporate facilities.Boca Juniors official website All of them placed in La Boca with the exception of Wilde (1914–15), located in Avellaneda Partido. Boca Juniors also used the Estudiantes de Buenos Aires (in 1913, then located on Figueroa Alcorta Avenue)Historia de Boca Juniors: 1913 and Ferro Carril Oeste stadium (1938–40) as temporary venues.Historia de Boca Juniors: 1938  Boca Juniors is traditionally regarded as the club of Argentina's working class, in contrast with the supposedly more upper-class base of cross-town arch rival Club Atlético River Plate. Boca Juniors claims to be the club of "half plus one" (la mitad más uno) of Argentina's population, but a 2006 survey placed its following at 40%,"Se cae un mito: la hinchada de Boca no suma la mitad más uno del país"&nbsp;– InfoBae still the largest share. They have the highest number of fans, as judged by percentage in their country. The Boca-River Superclásico rivalry is one of the most thrilling derbies in the world.World derbies: Boca Juniors v River Plate&nbsp;– BBC news. Out of their 338 previous meetings, Boca have won 126, River have won 107 and there have been 105 draws. After each match (except draws), street signs cover Buenos Aires at fans' own expense, "ribbing" the losing side with humorous posters. This has become part of Buenos Aires culture ever since a Boca winning streak in the 1990s. In 1975, a film (La Raulito) was made about the life of Mary Esher Duffau, known as La Raulito, a well-known Boca Juniors fan. She died at the age of 74 on 30 April 2008, the same day Boca Juniors played a Copa Libertadores match against Brazilian club, Cruzeiro Esporte Clube with the players and fans observing a minute's silence in her memory. Boca fans are known as Los Xeneizes (the Genoese) after the Genoese immigrants who founded the team and lived in La Boca in the early 20th century.Flags of the World article. The word xeneize is Genoese dialect for the Ligurian word zeneize, which means "Genoese". Many rival fans in Argentina refer to the Boca Juniors' fans as Los Bosteros (the manure handlers), originating from the horse manure used in the brick factory which occupied the ground where La Bombonera stands. Originally an insult used by rivals, Boca fans are now proud of it. Reflecting the team's colors, Boca's shirt is also called la azul y oro (the blue and gold). There is also a society which dedicates all of its activities to supporting the team known as la número 12 or la doce (player number doce or 12, meaning "the 12th player") "La doce" is a criminal organization similar to other "barra brava" gangs associated with football clubs in Argentina. Illegal activities by La doce include assault, drug sales and trafficking, extortion, and murder. La doce finances its activities by selling parking, reselling club tickets as well as extorting commission from the sale of players. La doce also extorts Boca Juniors for transportation to domestic and international events as well as their means of financing their activities. If their demands are not met they threaten violence at home matches or to take down club officials. The naming of "La 12″ (the twelfth player), by which Boca Juniors' fans became known, dates back to the year 1925, during the European tour they made that year. At that time, the team was accompanied by a Boca fan called Victoriano Caffarena, who belonged to a wealthy family and funded part of the tour. During that tour he helped the team in everything establishing a strong relationship with the players, so they named him "Player No. 12″. When they returned to Argentina, Caffarena was as well known as the players themselves. Nowadays, this nickname is used primarily to name their group of supporters, known as "La 12″. Peñas (fan clubs) exist in a number of Argentine cities and abroad in countries such as Russia, Ukraine,Russian-Ukrainian fan-site Narod.ru  Spain,Bocajuniors.com.ar: Listado de Peñas Israel  and Japan.  Boca Juniors are particularly popular in Japan because of the club's success in recent years at the Intercontinental Cup held in Japan. All over the world, fans are drawn to Boca by the club's international titles, and by the success of Boca players who went on to play in European football such as Hugo Ibarra, Rodolfo Arruabarrena, Diego Cagna, Enzo Ferrero, Roberto Abbondanzieri, Nicolás Burdisso, Fernando Gago, Diego Maradona, Claudio Caniggia, Gabriel Batistuta, Juan Román Riquelme and Carlos Tevez. Boca have fans throughout Latin America and also in parts of the United States where there has been Latin immigration and where in July 2007, after the club had toured pre-season, it was reported that the club were considering the possibility of creating a Boca Juniors USA team to compete in Major League Soccer (MLS) with New York City, Miami, Los Angeles and Arizona mentioned as possible locations.  Boca Juniors has had a long-standing rivalry with River Plate. The Superclásico is known worldwide as one of world football's fiercest and most important rivalries. It is particularly noted for the passion of the fans, the stands of both teams feature fireworks, coloured confetti, flags and rolls of paper. Both sets of supporters sing passionate songs (often based on popular Argentine rock band tunes) against their rivals, and the stadiums are known to bounce with the simultaneous jumping of the fans. Sometimes the games have been known to end in riots between the hardest supporters of both sides or against the police. The English newspaper The Observer put the Superclásico (played at La Bombonera) at the top of their list of 50 sporting things you must do before you die. The two clubs both have origins in the poor riverside area of Buenos Aires known as La Boca. River however moved to the more affluent district of Núñez in the north of the city in 1923.
