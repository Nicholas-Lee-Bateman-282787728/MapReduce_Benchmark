    Sunderland Association Football Club (, ) is an English professional football club based in the North East city of Sunderland in the larger metropolitan area of Tyne and Wear. The club is currently playing in the Premier League, the top league of English football. Since its formation in 1879, the club has won six top-flight First Division (now the Premier League) titles (1892, 1893, 1895, 1902, 1913, and 1936), a total only bettered by five other clubs, and has finished runners-up five times. The club has also won the FA Cup twice (1937 and 1973) and been runners-up twice (1913 and 1992), as well as winning the FA Community Shield in 1936 and being finalists the following year. Sunderland have also been Football League Cup finalists in 1985 and 2014. Sunderland won their first FA Cup in 1937 with a 3–1 victory over Preston North End, and remained in the top league for 68 successive seasons until they were relegated for the first time in 1958. Sunderland's most notable trophy after the Second World War was their second FA Cup in 1973, when the club secured a 1–0 victory over Leeds United.  The team has won the second tier title five times in that period and the third tier title once. Sunderland play their home games at the 49,000http://www.worldofstadiums.com/europe/united-kingdom/stadium-of-light/-capacity all-seater Stadium of Light having moved from Roker Park in 1997. The original ground capacity was 42,000 which was increased to 49,000 following expansion in 2000. Sunderland have a long-standing rivalry with their neighbouring club Newcastle United, with whom they have contested the Tyne–Wear derby since 1898. Since their most recent promotion to the Premier League in 2007, Sunderland have become one of the world's wealthiest football brands, being valued at USD $93 million in 2014, 31st in the world overall.[ ] brandirectory.com[ ] Sunderland AFC in world top 50 rich list.    Founded 17 October 1879 as 'Sunderland and District Teachers A.F.C.' by schoolmaster James Allan, Sunderland joined The Football League for the 1890–91 season. They replaced Stoke, who had failed to be re-elected, becoming the first new club to join the league since its inauguration in 1888.Days, p 27. During the late 19th century, they were declared the "Team of All Talents" by William McGregor,Days, p 21. the founder of the league, after a 7–2 win against Aston Villa. Sunderland won the league championship in the 1891–92 season, one season after joining The Football League. The club's 42 points were five clear of nearest rivals Preston North End, and this performance led The Times to describe the players as "a wonderfully fine team".Days, pp 29–30. Sunderland successfully defended the title the following season, aided by centre forward Johnny Campbell, who broke the 30-goal mark for the second time in consecutive seasons. In the process, they became the first team to score 100 goals in a season, a feat not matched until 1919–20, when West Bromwich Albion set a new record.Days, pp 31–32.  Sunderland came close to winning a third successive league championship in the 1893–94 season, finishing second behind Aston Villa. However, they regained the title in the 1894–95 season, ending the season five points ahead of Everton. After winning the English League Championship, Sunderland played against Heart of Midlothian, the champions of the Scottish League, in a game described as the Championship of the World title match. Sunderland won the game 5–3 and were announced "Champions of the world".Days, pp 35–36. Sunderland came close to winning another league title in the 1897–98 season, when they finished as runners-up to Sheffield United.Days, pp 43–44. That season was their last at Newcastle Road, as they moved to Roker Park the following season.Days, pp 45–46. After coming second in 1900–01, the club won their fourth league title in the 1901–02 season, beating Everton by a three-point margin.Days, pp 55–56. In 1904, Sunderland's management was embroiled in a payment scandal involving player Andrew McCombie. The club was said to have given the player £100 (£ today) to help him start his own business, on the understanding that he would repay the money after his benefit game. However, McCombie refused to repay the money, claiming it had been a gift. An investigation conducted by the Football Association concluded that the money given to McCombie was part of a "re-signing/win/draw bonus", which violated the Association's rules. Sunderland were fined £250 (£ today), and six directors were suspended for two and a half years for not showing a true record of the club's financial dealings. Sunderland manager Alex Mackie was also suspended for three months for his involvement in the affair.Days, p 63. On 5 December 1908, Sunderland achieved their highest ever league win, against north-east rivals Newcastle United. They won the game 9–1; Billy Hogg and George Holley each scored hat-tricks.Days, pp 73–76. The club won the league again in 1913,Days, pp 85–86. but lost their first FA Cup final 1–0 to Aston Villa, in a very tough loss. This was the closest the club has come to winning the league title and the FA Cup in the same season.Days, pp 87–88. Two seasons later the First World War brought the league to a halt. After the league's resumption, Sunderland came close to winning another championship in the 1922–23 season, when they were runners-up to Liverpool.Days, pp 107–108. They also came close the following season, finishing third, four points from the top of the league.Days, pp 111–112. The club escaped relegation from the First Division by one point in the 1927–28 season despite 35 goals from Dave Halliday. The point was won in a match against Middlesbrough, and they finished in fifteenth place.Days, pp 121–122. Halliday improved his goal scoring to 43 goals in 42 games the following season, an all-time Sunderland record for goals scored in a single season. The club's sixth league championship came in the 1935–36 season,Days, pp 139–140. and they won the FA Cup the following season, after a 3–1 victory against Preston North End at Wembley Stadium. The remainder of the decade saw mid-table finishes, until the league and FA Cup were suspended for the duration of the Second World War. Some football was still played as a morale boosting exercise, in the form of the Football League War Cup. Sunderland were finalists in the tournament in 1942, but were beaten by Wolverhampton Wanderers.Days, p 154. For Sunderland, the immediate post-war years were characterised by significant spending; the club paid £18,000 (£ today) for Carlisle United's Ivor Broadis in January 1949. Broadis was also Carlisle's manager at the time, and this is the first instance of a player transferring himself to another club. This, along with record-breaking transfer fees to secure the services of Len Shackleton and Welsh international Trevor Ford, led to a contemporary nickname, the "Bank of England club".Days, pp 169–170. The club finished third in the First Division in 1950, their highest finish since the 1936 championship. The late 1950s saw a sharp downturn in Sunderland's fortunes, and the club was once again implicated in a major financial scandal in 1957. Found guilty of making payments to players in excess of the maximum wage, they were fined £5,000 (£ today), and their chairman and three directors were suspended.Days, pp 183–184. The following year, Sunderland were relegated from the highest division for the first time in their 68-year league history.Days, p 187.  Sunderland's absence from the top flight lasted six years. The club came within one game of promotion back to the First Division in the 1962–63 season. Sunderland required only a draw in their final game against promotion rivals Chelsea, who had another game left to play after this match, to secure promotion. However, they were defeated, and Chelsea won their last game 7–0 to clinch promotion, finishing ahead of Sunderland on goal average.Days, pp 199–200. After the close call in the previous season, the club was promoted to Division One in 1964 after finishing in second place. Sunderland beat Charlton Athletic in the final stages of the season, where they clinched promotion with a game to spare.Days, pp 201–202. At the end of the decade, they were again relegated to the Second Division after finishing 21st.Days, pp 217–218.  Sunderland won their last major trophy in 1973, in a 1–0 victory over Don Revie's Leeds United in the FA Cup Final. A Second Division club at the time, Sunderland won the game thanks mostly to the efforts of their goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery, who saved two of Leeds shots at goal in quick succession, one being from hot-shot Peter Lorimer. Ian Porterfield scored a volley in the 30th minute to beat Leeds and take the trophy. Since 1973 only two other clubs, Southampton in 1976, and West Ham United in 1980, have equalled Sunderland's achievement of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football. By winning the 1973 FA Cup Final, Sunderland qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the club's only appearance in European competition to date. Sunderland beat Vasas Budapest 3–0 on aggregate, and were drawn against Lisbon club Sporting in the second round. They won the first leg at Roker Park 2–1 but were defeated 2–0 in the away leg, and were knocked out of the competition 3–2 on aggregate. After spending six seasons in the Second Division, Sunderland were promoted to Division One in the 1975–76 season; they topped the table over Bristol City by three points.Days, pp 235–236. However, Sunderland were relegated the following season back into Division Two, without their FA Cup Final winning manager Bob Stokoe, who had resigned because of health problems at the start of the season.Days, pp 239–240. The club celebrated its 100-year centenary in the 1979–80 season with a testimonial against an England XI side, which they lost 2–0.Days, pp 247–248. Sunderland appeared in their first League Cup final in 1985, but lost 1–0 to Norwich City. In 1987, Sunderland saw one of the lowest points in their history, when they were relegated to the Third Division of the English league for the first time.Days, pp 265–266. Under new chairman Bob Murray and new manager Denis Smith, the club was promoted the following season.Days, pp 269–270. In 1990, they were promoted back to the top flight in unusual circumstances. Sunderland lost to Swindon Town in the play-off final, but Swindon's promotion was revoked after the club was found guilty of financial irregularities and Sunderland were promoted instead. They stayed up for one year before being relegated on the final day of the following season.  Sunderland's next outing in a major final came in 1992 when, as a Second Division club, they returned to the FA Cup final. There was to be no repeat of the heroics of 1973, as Sunderland lost 2–0 to Liverpool. The early 1990s was a turbulent period for the club. In 1995, they faced the prospect of a return to the third-tier of English football.Days, pp 291–292. Peter Reid was brought in as manager, and quickly turned things around. Reid's time in charge had a stabilising effect; he remained manager for seven years. After promotion from Division One in the 1995–96 season, Sunderland began their first season in the Premier League, but finished third from the bottom and were relegated back to the First Division. In 1997, Sunderland left Roker Park, their home for 99 years. Bearing fond memories of the stadium, former Sunderland player Len Shackleton said, "There will never be another place like Roker".Days, p 298. The club moved to the Stadium of Light, a 42,000-seat arena that, at the time, was the largest stadium built in England after the Second World War. The capacity was later increased to 49,000. Sunderland returned to the Premier League as First Division champions in 1999 with a then-record 105 points.Days, p 312. Sunderland's 1999–2000 season started at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea beat them 4–0. However, in the return match later in the season Sunderland turned the tables on Chelsea, avenging their 4–0 defeat with a 4–1 win at the Stadium of Light.  Sunderland also achieved a 2–1 victory over rivals Newcastle United at St. James' Park,  a result which helped bring about the resignation of Newcastle's manager, Ruud Gullit. At the end of the season Sunderland finished seventh, with Kevin Phillips winning the European Golden Shoe in his first top-flight season, scoring 30 goals. Another seventh-place finish in the 2000–01 season was followed by two less successful seasons, and they were relegated to the second-tier with a then-record low 19 points in 2003. Former Ireland manager Mick McCarthy took over at the club, and, in 2005, he took Sunderland up as champions for the third time in less than ten years. However, the club's stay in the top flight was short-lived; as Sunderland were once again relegated, this time with a new record-low total of 15 points. McCarthy left the club in mid-season, and he was replaced temporarily by former Sunderland player Kevin Ball. The record-low fifteen-point performance was surpassed in the 2007–08 season by Derby County, who finished on eleven points.  Following Sunderland's relegation from the Premier League, the club was taken over by the Irish Drumaville Consortium, headed by ex-player Niall Quinn, who appointed former Manchester United captain Roy Keane as the new manager. Under Keane, the club rose steadily up the table with an unbeaten run of 17 games to win promotion to the Premier League, and were named winners of the Championship after beating Luton Town 5–0 at Kenilworth Road on 6 May 2007. The club's form in the 2007–08 season was better than during their last season in the Premier League, as they finished 15th with 39&nbsp;points. Following an inconsistent start to the 2008–09 season Keane resigned, to be replaced by coach Ricky Sbragia as caretaker until the end of the season. After keeping Sunderland in the Premier League, Sbragia stepped down from his managerial post. Meanwhile, off the pitch, Irish-American tycoon Ellis Short completed a full takeover of the club from the Irish Drumaville Consortium, and Steve Bruce was announced as the new manager on 3 June. One of Bruce's first signings, Darren Bent, cost a club record fee of £10 million. Sunderland started their first season under Bruce strongly, including victories against Arsenal and Liverpool, but then went 14 matches without a win over the winter, eventually finishing the 2009–10 season 13th. Sunderland completed the signing of Ghana international Asamoah Gyan in August 2010 for a fee around £13&nbsp;million, becoming their new record transfer fee. Sunderland started the next season strongly, this time with a seven match unbeaten run against teams including Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United. However, the run was ended with a 5–1 defeat to local rivals Newcastle United on 31 October 2010. Sunderland bounced back with another good run, the highlight being a 3–0 victory against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. This run left Sunderland challenging for a European qualification place by the end of 2010. However, striker Darren Bent left Sunderland for Aston Villa in January 2011 in a deal potentially worth £24 million (a record transfer fee received for the club). Following Bent's departure Sunderland suffered a mid-season slump and finished 10th&nbsp;— which was still their highest top-flight finish for 10 years. Ellis Short replaced Quinn as chairman in October 2011, with Quinn becoming Director of International Development. Bruce was sacked on 30 November 2011, following a poor run of results, and was replaced by Martin O'Neill. O'Neill made an instant impact, with Sunderland taking 13 points from a possible 18 in his first six games in charge, including a 1–0 defeat of leaders Manchester City on New Year's Day 2012. O'Neill was named the Premier League Manager of the Month for December, and went on to guide the club to the FA Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2004. On 20 February 2012, Niall Quinn left the club with immediate effect. Sunderland endured a difficult start to 2012–13 season, with their first victory not coming until late September against Wigan. With the threat of relegation looming, O'Neill was sacked on 30 March, following a 1–0 home defeat by Manchester United. Paolo Di Canio was announced as O'Neill's replacement the following day, bringing his own backroom staff. The appointment prompted the immediate resignation of club Vice Chairman David Miliband due to Di Canio's "past political statements". The appointment of Di Canio also sparked opposition from the Durham Miners' Association, which threatened to remove one of its mining banners from Sunderland's Stadium of Light, which is built on the former site of the Wearmouth Colliery.[ ]  The threat by the Durham Miners' Association was removed after meeting with the management of the club. After a 2–1 loss at Chelsea, Di Canio's second match in charge saw Sunderland beat Newcastle 3–0 at St James' Park in the Tyne Wear Derby and their first win at St James Park since November 2000. Sunderland went on to survive relegation with one game to go. Over the summer, the club appointed Italian former agent Roberto De Fanti as the club's first director of football.  Di Canio was sacked after a poor start to the 2013–14 season, and reports of a complete breakdown in relations with his players.http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/paolo-di-canio-was-fired-by-sunderland-for-systematic-destruction-of-his-players-8835606.ht Gus Poyet was announced as his replacement on 8 October 2013. Poyet brought a turnaround in Sunderland 's fortunes as they brought their way back into contention for survival with wins against Newcastle, Manchester City and Everton. Poyet also led Sunderland to the 2014 Football League Cup Final against Manchester City, winning a penalty shootout at Manchester United in the semi-final. Sunderland were defeated 3–1 by City in the final, despite leading 1–0 at half time through a Fabio Borini goal. Despite a major post-final slump, which left the club bottom of the table 7 points adrift with 6 games remaining, they drew at Manchester City and then defeated Chelsea 1–2, becoming the first side to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League under José Mourinho, ending a streak of 77 games over two spells. The Black Cats went on to win their next 3 games, including away at Man Utd, to avoid relegation with a game to spare. De Fanti was sacked as Director of Football in January 2014 and was replaced with Lee Congerton as Sporting Director. Poyet signed a new two-year deal after the last game of the season. However, on 16 March 2015 Poyet was sacked, following a run of 1 win in 12 games that left the club just one place above the relegation zone. Veteran Dutchman Dick Advocaat was appointed as the club's new head coach the following day on a deal to the end of the season. Advocaat led Sunderland to Premier League safety with a game to spare following a 0–0 draw away at Arsenal. Despite initially deciding against signing a permanent contract, he changed his mind and signed a one-year contract as permanent head coach. However, he resigned from the position after only eight games into the 2015–16 season, leaving Sunderland second from bottom and without a win. Sam Allardyce was appointed the next manager in October 2015, and secured a 3–0 victory over Newcastle Utd in his second game, giving the club a record beating six wins in a row against their local rivals.  Sunderland played in an all blue strip from their formation until 1884, when they adopted a red and white halved strip. They assumed the current strip of red and white stripes in the 1887–88 season.Days, p 15. Their badge included a ship, the upper part of the Sunderland coat of arms, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderland's red and white stripes. In 1977 the badge was changed, but still included the ship, football and the background of red and white stripes. This badge was used until the relocation from Roker Park to the Stadium of Light. To coincide with the move, Sunderland released a new crest divided into four quarters; the upper right and lower left featured their traditional red and white colours, but the ship was omitted. The upper left section features the Penshaw Monument and the lower right section shows the Wearmouth Bridge. A colliery wheel at the top of the crest commemorates County Durham's mining history, and the land the Stadium of Light was built on, formerly the Monkwearmouth Colliery. The crest also contains two lions, the black cats of Sunderland, and a banner displaying the club's motto, Consectatio Excellentiae, which means "In pursuit of excellence".    Sunderland have had seven stadiums throughout their history; the first was at Blue House Field in Hendon in 1879. The ground was close to the place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent for use of the ground was £10 (£ today). The club relocated briefly to Groves Field in Ashbrooke in 1882, before moving again the following season. The club's third stadium was Horatio Street in Roker, the first Sunderland stadium north of the River Wear; the club played a single season there before another move, this time to Abbs Field in Fulwell for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission. Sunderland moved to Newcastle Road in 1886. By 1898, the ground reached a capacity of 15,000 after renovations, and its rent had risen to £100 (£ today) a year. Near the turn of the 20th century, Sunderland needed a bigger stadium. They returned to Roker and set up home in Roker Park. It was opened on 10 September 1898, and the home team played a match the same day against Liverpool, which they won. The stadium's capacity increased to 50,000 after redevelopment with architect Archibald Leitch in 1913. Sunderland were nearly bankrupted by the cost of renovating the Main Stand, and Roker Park was put up for sale but no further action was taken. On&nbsp;8 March 1933, an overcrowded Roker Park recorded the highest ever attendance at a Sunderland match, 75,118 against Derby County in a FA Cup sixth round replay. Roker Park suffered a bombing in 1943, in which one corner of the stadium was destroyed. A special constable was killed while patrolling the stadium. By the 1990s, the stadium was no longer large enough, and had no room for possible expansion.Days, pp 153–154. In January 1990, the Taylor Report was released after overcrowding at the Hillsborough Stadium resulted in 96 deaths, an incident known as the Hillsborough Disaster. The report recommended that all major stadiums must be converted to an all-seater design. As a result, Roker Park's capacity was reduced. It was demolished in 1997 and a housing estate built in its place.  In 1997, Sunderland moved to their present ground, Stadium of Light in Monkwearmouth, which was opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Built with an original capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team Ajax. The stadium bears a similar name to the Portuguese club Benfica's ground Estádio da Luz, albeit in a different language. Stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A Davy lamp monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner was presented to the club by the Durham Miners' Association, as a reminder of the Monkwearmouth Colliery pit the stadium was built on.  Sunderland held the seventh highest average home attendance out of the 20 clubs in the Premier League at the end of the 2013–14 season with an average of 41,089, and held the sixth highest average attendance in the 2014–15 season with an average of over 43,000. Sunderland fans often sell out allocations for away games: in the 2013–14 season, 9,000 Sunderland fans attended Old Trafford for the second leg of the Football League Cup semi-final, which they won to go through to the final. At Wembley, London was taken over by thousands of Mackems, the sights of Covent Garden and Leicester Square were awash with red and white, local shops completely sold out of alcohol but only one arrest was reported by the police. Support is drawn from across the North East, in particular County Durham, and beyond. The club has many supporter branches across the world, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Cambodia, and Greece. According to YouGov statistics they are the most left-wing supporters in the Premier League, and often sing "The Red Flag" during games. Former chairman Bob Murray described Sunderland as a "Labour Club".  Traditionally, Sunderland's main rivals are Newcastle United, with whom they contest the Tyne–Wear derby.  The club also has a rivalry with Middlesbrough, with whom they contest the Tees–Wear derby. The club was rivals with the now defunct Sunderland Albion in the 1880s and 1890s; a breakaway club formed by Sunderland's founder James Allan.Days, p 19. The fans share a mutual friendship with Dutch club Feyenoord, this was developed after Wearside shipbuilders found jobs in Rotterdam during the 1970s and 80s. The club has an official quarterly magazine, called the Legion of Light, which season ticket holders receive for no cost. One of the club's current fanzine is A Love Supreme. Others in the past have been It's The Hope I Can't Stand,  It's An Easy One For Norman/It's An Easy One For Given, Sex and Chocolate, Wise Men Say and The Roker Roar (later The Wearside Roar). Sunderland have recently created affiliations with several African clubs including Ghana's Asante Kotoko, Eqypt's El-Ittihad El-Iskandary  and South Africa's Bidvest Wits. Sunderland also have an affiliation with Belgian side Lierse S.K., allowing the possibility for young African players who would not qualify for a UK work permit to spend three years with Lierse to gain a Belgian passport. In August 2014, Sunderland announced a commercial partneship with Washington D.C. based MLS club D.C. United. The partnership draws on the club's existing links to the USA through American owner Ellis Short, player Jozy Altidore, as well as the pre-existing friendship agreement between the two cities.   The holder of the record for the most league appearances is Jimmy Montgomery, having made 527&nbsp;first team appearances between 1961 and 1976.Dykes, pp 280–282. The club's top league goal scorer is Charlie Buchan, who scored 209&nbsp;goals from 1911–1925; Bobby Gurney is the record goalscorer over all competitions with 227&nbsp;goals between 1926&nbsp;and&nbsp;1939. Dave Halliday holds the record for the most goals scored in a season: 43&nbsp;in the 1928–29 season in the Football League First Division. As of October 2014 John O'Shea is the most capped player for the club, making 100&nbsp;appearances for the Republic of Ireland. The club's widest victory margin in the league was in the 9–1 win against Newcastle United in the First Division in 1908. Sunderland's biggest ever win in the FA cup was against Fair field (a non-league team) and the final score was 11 – 1. Their heaviest defeats in the league were 8–0 against Sheffield Wednesday in 1911, West Ham United in 1968, Watford in 1982 and Southampton in 2014Mason, p 443. Sunderland joined the top division in England, The Football League, in the 1890–91 season and were not relegated until 1957–58 (a span of 67&nbsp;seasons). In October 2015, Sunderland defeated rivals Newcastle United for the sixth consecutive time, a new record. Sunderland's record home attendance is 75,200 for a sixth round replay FA Cup match against Derby County on 8 March 1933. The biggest transfer fee Sunderland have ever received for one of their players is £24 million for Darren Bent who moved to Aston Villa on 18 January 2011. The biggest fee Sunderland have received for a player produced by the Sunderland academy is £16 million (rising to a possible £20 million)  for Jordan Henderson, who moved to Liverpool on 9 July 2011. The biggest transfer fee paid by Sunderland is the eventual £16 million after add-ons for Bent, who was bought from Tottenham Hotspur in July 2009. As of season 2015/16  Sunderland's official nickname is The Black Cats. They have other nicknames, such as 'The Rokerites', 'The Lads' or 'The Mackems'. After leaving Roker Park for the Stadium of Light in 1997, the club decided on a vote to settle the nickname for the last time. The Black Cats won the majority of the 11,000&nbsp;votes, beating off other used nicknames such as the Light Brigade, the Miners, and the Sols. There is a long historical link between black cats and Sunderland, including the "Black Cat Battery", an Artillery battery based on the River Wear. Around the early 19th century, the southern side of the River Wear contained four gun batteries, which guarded the river mouth during the Napoleonic wars. In 1805, the battery was manned by local militia, the Sunderland Loyal Volunteers, one of whom was a cooper by trade named Joshua Dunn. He was said to have "fled from the howling of an approaching black cat, convinced by the influence of the full moon and a warming dram or two that it was the devil incarnate". From that point onwards the John Paul Jones Battery was known as the Black Cat Battery. A Sunderland supporter, Billy Morris, took a black cat in his top pocket as a good luck charm to the 1937 FA Cup final in which Sunderland brought home the trophy for the first time. During the 1960s a black cat lived in Roker Park, fed and watered by the football club. Since the 1960s the emblem of the Sunderland A.F.C. Supporters Association has been a black cat. As well as the "Team of All Talents" at the turn of the 20th century, Sunderland were known as the "Bank of England club" during the 1950s. This was a reference to the club's spending in the transfer market at the time, which saw the transfer-record broken twice. At the beginning of the 2006–07 season, the purchase of the club by the Irish Drumaville Consortium, the appointments of Niall Quinn and Roy Keane to their respective roles as chairman and manager, as well as the relatively large number of Irish players in the squad, led some fans to jokingly dub the team "Sund-Ireland". The first sponsor to appear on Sunderland kits was Cowie's, the business group of then chairman Tom Cowie, between 1983–85. The club was sponsored by the Vaux Breweries between 1985 and 1999, with drink brands such as Lambtons sometimes appearing on kits. Subsequently, the club were sponsored by Sunderland car dealership company Reg Vardy from 1999 to 2007. Sunderland were sponsored by the Irish bookmaker Boylesports, who signed a four-year contract with the club in 2007 worth up to £12&nbsp;million. In April 2010, Sunderland signed a two-year shirt sponsorship deal with tombola, a local online bingo company. On 25 June 2012, Sunderland announced the strengthening of their partership with the Invest in Africa initiative, with the initiative becoming the club's shirt sponsor for two years. The project is closely linked with Tullow Oil. However, after a year the club announced a new sponsorship deal with South African company Bidvest.
