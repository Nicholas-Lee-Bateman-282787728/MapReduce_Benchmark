 The Lamborghini Gallardo (; ) is a sports car built by Lamborghini from 2003 to 2013. It is Lamborghini's best-selling model with 14,022 being built throughout its lifetime.Lamborghini Gallardo production ends on No. 14,022 - AutoBlog, 26 November 2013 Named after a famous breed of fighting bull,  the V-10 Gallardo has been Lamborghini's sales leader and stable-mate to a succession of V-12 flagship models—first to the  Lamborghini Murciélago (4,099 built between 2001 and 2011), then to the current flagship Lamborghini Aventador. On November 25, 2013, the last Gallardo was rolled off the production line. Production of the replacement for the Gallardo, the Huracán, began in 2014.  The first generation Gallardo came with an even firing 5 litre 90 degree V10 (4961cc). The Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional (H-Box) six-speed manual transmission, and an advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically controlled semi-automatic robotized manual, which Lamborghini abbreviates to "E-gear". The "E-gear" allows the driver to make shifts much faster than they could with a manual transmission. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic mode.Introducing the Gallardo LamboCars.com The vehicle was designed by Luc Donckerwolke and was based on the 1995 Calà prototype by Italdesign Giugiaro. For the 2006 model year (launched in late 2005) Lamborghini introduced many changes to the car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. These were based on the limited edition Gallardo SE. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter around town), the suspension was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20&nbsp;bhp to a maximum of , and the biggest change was an overall lowering of the gearing, especially in 1st to 5th. The result was a much improved car: it handled and turned better, sounded better under full throttle and the extra power and lower gearing made an already fast car into a much faster one.  The Lamborghini Concept S is a 2005 concept car Based on the Lamborghini Gallardo, with an open roadster body designed by Luc Donckerwolke. It was first shown at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show. It was intended to be a modern interpretation of the single-seat roadsters of the past. Utilizing a 'saute-vent' (French for 'change wind') instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5 L V10 engine, gives the car a distinctly futuristic look. This is also to increase aerodynamic flow. The rear-view mirror is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when necessary, or hide it when not in use. Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer-aided designs. Lamborghini had rumored to be building 100 for customers, but decided to keep it as a styling exercise. Only 2 models were ever made: the high-window prototype sits in the Lamborghini museum with no engine, while the running low-window prototype featured at Pebble Beach is up for auction on 10 December 2015 at RM Sotheby's Manhattan event "Driven by Disruption". It is expected to go for $2.4 to 3 million. The production spyder model of the Gallardo was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006.  It was considered by the company to be an entirely new model, with  and a lower-ratio six-speed manual transmission.  The soft top was fully retractable.  During the 2007 Geneva Auto ShowAutoBlog.com, Geneva Motor Show: Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera Lamborghini debuted the Gallardo Superleggera. The name paid tribute to the construction style of the first Lamborghini production model, the 350GT, designed and built by Carrozzeria Touring  and its emphasis on weight reduction. The Superleggera was lighter than the base Gallardo by  via the use of carbon fibre panels for the rear diffuser, undertray, the rearview-mirror housings, the interior door panels, the central tunnel, engine cover; titanium wheel nuts and carbon fibre sports seats. The engine power was upgraded by  thanks to an improved intake, exhaust and ECU for a total of . The 6-speed E-Gear transmission was standard on US spec models with the 6-speed manual transmission offered as a no cost option.  In December 2004, two Gallardos were donated to the Italian Polizia di Stato in honour of the force's 152nd anniversary, one came from Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. while a second one was donated by an independent organization. The Gallardo police cars are used by the traffic police (Polizia Stradale) during emergencies and alarm situations on the Salerno-Reggio Calabria highway, also under the powers of the special safety operative which is already being employed along that tract of highway and, above all, for the transport of body organs destined for transplantation. However, both of the Gallardos were destroyed in the course of duty. When the Lamborghini Huracán, Gallardo's successor, was introduced, Lamborghini S.p.A produced several special police versions, dubbed Huracán LP 610-4 Polizia, which are specifically produced for the Italian State Police. Yellow L140 Gallardos have been "temporary" police cars for the Metropolitan Police in London, England, one in 2005 and one in 2006, for specific publicity events. The 2006 vehicle was seen at the start of the 2006 Gumball Rally. Both vehicles were lent by Lamborghini London and were fitted with yellow and blue battenburg markings, police logos and a small blue lightbar.  The Gallardo SE was a limited edition of 250 units introduced in 2005. It was distinguished from the regular Gallardo externally by having a black-roofed two-tone color scheme as well as specially designed "Callisto" rims. It comes with a two-tone interior. All piping and stitching on the ultra-quality leather are executed in the same color as the bodywork of the car. The midsections of the seats are finished in color-coded upholstery and even the black floormats have a color-coded border. A rear-view camera was standard on the Gallardo SE, as was the multimedia and navigation system, the sport suspension and an exclusive cover. The optional E-gear transmission came with a new function: 'thrust' mode. This feature automatically revs the car to 5,000 rpm then drops the clutch engaging all four wheels in a controlled burnout to ensure that the car performs maximum acceleration. The Gallardo Nera was a special edition limited to 185 units of the Gallardo and was introduced at the Paris Motor Show. The car was designed to showcase the customization options available to the customer in the Ad Personam program. It features special matte black body panels and was only available in a special shade of black: a combination of Nero Serapis and Nero Noctis. Brake calipers are painted a special silver and the taillights are smoked to match the darker paint scheme. The interior was stitched from high-contrast black and white leather in the Q-Citura (lozenge shaped) fashion. In 2007, the Gallardo was entered in the FIA GT3 Championship, built by German motorsport specialists Reiter Engineering, who previously made the Murcielago R-GT and the Diablo GTR Super Trophy racers. All the extra aerodynamics were bolt-on parts, conforming with cost-effective regulations that meant the finished car had to closely resemble its road-going counterpart. Brembo racing brakes and OZ Racing wheels were also added. It was converted to Rear Wheel Drive, other than when racing in the one-make Lamborghini Super Trofeo. It produced  @ 7800rpm and  @ 4500 rpm of torque. Lamborghini recalled about 1,500 Gallardo Coupé and Spyder models, from model years 2004 to 2006, because of the possibility of power steering fluid leaking and the risk of fire. The cars were built from May 2003 through April 2008. In March 2008, Lamborghini announced that they had ceased production of the Gallardo Superleggera.
