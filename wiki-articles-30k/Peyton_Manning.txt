   Peyton Williams Manning (born March 24, 1976) is an American football quarterback for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). A five-time league MVP, he played for the Indianapolis Colts for 14 seasons between 1998 and 2011. He is a son of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and an elder brother of New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning. Manning played college football for the University of Tennessee, leading the Volunteers to the 1997 SEC Championship in his senior season. He was chosen by the Indianapolis Colts with the first overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft. Manning's playing career and statistics have ranked him among the greatest passing quarterbacks of all-time. From 1998 to 2010, he led the Indianapolis Colts to eight (seven AFC South and one AFC East) division championships, two AFC championships, and one Super Bowl championship (Super Bowl XLI).  His five NFL MVPs are a league record, he was the most valuable player of Super Bowl XLI, has been named to 14 Pro Bowls, has thirteen 4,000-yard passing seasons, and is the Indianapolis Colts' all-time leader in passing yards (54,828) and touchdown passes (399). In 2009, he was named the best player in the NFL, and Fox Sports, along with Sports Illustrated, named him the NFL player of the decade for the 2000s.  Before the 2013 season had even finished, SI had named him their Sportsman of the Year. In May 2011, he underwent neck surgery to alleviate neck pain and arm weakness he dealt with during the previous few seasons before signing a five-year, $90 million contract extension with the Colts in July 2011. Manning had hoped to play in the 2011 season, but in September 2011 he underwent a second, and much more serious surgery: a level-one cervical fusion procedure. Manning had never missed an NFL game in his career, but was forced to miss the entire 2011 season. He was released by the Colts on March 7, 2012, and after an almost two-week period where he visited with and worked out for several NFL teams, he signed with the Denver Broncos on March 20, 2012. On October 19, 2014, he broke Brett Favre's record for most career TDs when he threw his 509th touchdown pass, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. On November 15, 2015, Manning overtook Favre as the all-time passing yardage leader in a game against the Kansas City Chiefs. During a 2009 Monday Night Football game, Manning received the nickname "The Sheriff" from color commentator Jon Gruden due to his tendency to audible prior to the snap, and he is one of the most recognizable and parodied players in the NFL. Teams led by Manning more often than not use the hurry-up offense in place of the standard huddle. Manning attended Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, Louisiana. He led his team to a 34–5 record during three seasons as starter. He was named Gatorade Circle of Champions National Player-of-the-Year and Columbus (Ohio) Touchdown Club National Offensive Player-of-the-Year in 1993. While at Newman he began wearing the number 18 in honor of his older brother Cooper, who was forced to give up football due to spinal stenosis. Younger brother Eli also wore the number when he became starting quarterback. Newman has since retired the number 18 jersey and it can be seen hanging in the school gym. Manning surprised many when he chose to attend the University of Tennessee and play for the Tennessee Volunteers football team, instead of attending the University of Mississippi, his father's alma mater. He became Tennessee's all-time leading passer with 11,201&nbsp;yards and 89&nbsp;touchdowns and won 39 of 45 games as a starter, breaking the Southeastern Conference (SEC) record for career wins.  As a freshman, Manning was the third-string quarterback, but injuries to Todd Helton and Jerry Colquitt forced him to take over the Mississippi State game, a 24–21 loss. In his first start, the following week against Washington State, the Vols won, 10–9, and the Vols won all but one of their remaining games, finishing the season 8–4 with a 45–23 victory over Virginia Tech in the Gator Bowl. Manning and the Vols started off the 1995 season with victories over East Carolina and Georgia, before heading off to Gainesville to play the Gators. Against Florida, he threw for 326&nbsp;yards and 2&nbsp;touchdowns, leading the Vols to a 30–21 halftime lead. However, the Gators outscored the Vols 41–7 in the second half, winning 62–37. This was the Vols' only loss of the season, as they won their remaining 8 regular season games, including a 41–14 win over Alabama and then defeated Ohio State in the Citrus Bowl. The Vols ended the season ranked third and Manning came in sixth in Heisman Trophy voting. The Vols opened the 1996 season ranked second behind Nebraska and one of the favorites to win the national championship. However, after winning their first 2 games against UNLV and UCLA, the Vols again lost to Florida 35–29, with Manning throwing 4 interceptions. After winning their next four games, the Vols were upset by Memphis, despite Manning passing for 296&nbsp;yards. The Vols won the remainder of their games, including a 48–28 win in the Citrus Bowl over Northwestern, a game in which Manning passed for 408&nbsp;yards and 4&nbsp;touchdowns; he was named the game's MVP. Manning completed his degree in three years, a Bachelor of Arts in speech communication, and was projected to be the top overall pick in the NFL Draft, but returned to Tennessee for his senior year. In his senior season, the Vols opened the season with victories against Texas Tech and UCLA, but for the third time in his career, Manning fell to Florida 33–20. The Vols won the rest of their regular season games, finishing 10–1, and advanced to the SEC Championship game against Auburn. Down 20–7, Manning led the Vols to a 30–29 victory. Throwing for 4&nbsp;touchdowns, he was named the game's MVP, but injured himself in the process. The 3rd-ranked Vols were matched-up with second-ranked Nebraska in the Orange Bowl; if Tennessee won and top-ranked Michigan lost to Washington State in the Rose Bowl, the Vols would win the national championship. However, the Vols' defense could not stop Nebraska's rushing attack, giving up over 400&nbsp;rushing yards in a 42–17 loss. As a senior, Manning won numerous awards; he was a consensus first-team All-American, the Maxwell Award winner, the Davey O'Brien Award winner, the Johnny Unitas Award winner, and the Best College Player ESPY award winner, among others. In 2005, Tennessee retired Manning's number (No. 16). One of the streets leading to Neyland Stadium has been renamed Peyton Manning Pass. Manning also excelled academically and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1997 and awarded the National Football Foundation National Scholar-Athlete Award.  Manning was selected by the Indianapolis Colts with the first overall pick of the 1998 NFL draft.  He would start as a rookie and go on to play for the Colts for 13 full seasons before being sidelined by a neck injury, which cost him the entire 2011 season.  After recovering from the injury he joined the Denver Broncos for whom he has played since the 2012 season. Excluding the year lost to injury, Manning is now playing in his 17th NFL season. Manning has had an extremely successful career, and is frequently referred to as one of the greatest passing quarterbacks of all time. He has been named the NFL's most valuable player a record five times (four times as a Colt, once as a Bronco), has been named to the Pro Bowl 14 times (a record) and named first team All-Pro seven times. As a starter up to the end of 2015 season he had a career winning percentage of .702 in the regular season. He holds the NFL record for career touchdown passes and career passing yards, achieved in 2014 and 2015 respectively. The most commonly cited criticism of Peyton Manning's professional career is that despite great success and gaudy statistics during the regular season, he has not enjoyed similar levels of success in the post-season.  Although Manning has won one Super Bowl (Super Bowl XLI, in which he was named MVP) and played in two others, his career post-season record as a starter is a more modest 13-13. Although by no means unsuccessful, by comparison his regular season record through the 2015 season was 186-79. Despite concerns about his arm strength and mobility, Manning was selected first overall in the 1998 draft by the Indianapolis Colts. Although many considered Ryan Leaf his rival for the first selection in the draft, and Leaf's quarterback rating was higher, all six experts Sports Illustrated consulted believed that Manning was superior. Five said that they would take him first in the draft; Sid Gillman said of Manning, "this is a pro quarterback". In his rookie season, he passed for 3,739&nbsp;yards with 26&nbsp;touchdowns, set five different NFL rookie records including most touchdown passes in a season, and was named to the NFL All-Rookie First Team. Manning's first win came against fellow rookie Leaf, 17–12 over the Chargers. Weeks later, Manning faced off against Steve Young; he threw three&nbsp;touchdowns, tying a Colts rookie record, but the 49ers kicked a late field goal to win 34–31. In November against the Jets, Manning threw for three&nbsp;touchdowns in a 24–23 win; he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. It was the first game-winning drive of Manning's career, as he threw the game-winning TD pass to Marcus Pollard. Manning was certainly a bright spot in 1998 for the Colts, but he also threw a league high 28 interceptions as the team struggled to a 3–13 record with a defense that gave up more than 27 points per game. The Colts lost many close games, including five games in which they had led by double-digits at some point. The Indianapolis Colts opened the 1999 season with a 31–14 victory over Buffalo, but gave up a 28–7 lead the following week against the Patriots and lost. After defeating San Diego 27–19 in a game in which Manning threw for over 400&nbsp;yards, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week, they lost again, to Miami. The Colts responded by winning 11 of their remaining 12 games, finishing 13–3 and the AFC East champions. The 10 game turnaround from the previous year set an NFL record. As the second seed in the AFC, the Colts earned a first round bye, and faced Tennessee in the playoffs. The Colts lost 19–16 to the Super Bowl bound Titans and Manning was limited to one touchdown run. Manning finished the year with 4,135 passing yards and 26 passing touchdowns, and was named both Second-team All-Pro and to the Pro Bowl, both firsts for him. In the Pro Bowl, he passed for 270&nbsp;yards with 2&nbsp;touchdowns. The Colts started the 2000 season inconsistently. Following an opening week victory against Kansas City, they blew a 21–0 lead against the Raiders. The Colts responded with a Monday Night victory against Jacksonville, a 43–14 win in which Manning threw for 430&nbsp;yards and 4&nbsp;touchdowns; Manning was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. The Colts won 4 of their next 5 games, including one against New England in which Manning posted the first perfect passer rating of his career, but then lost 4 of the 5 games following that. The Colts regained their momentum, winning their final 3 games, including a 31–10 win over Minnesota on Week 17. Manning threw for 4 touchdowns in the win and was again named AFC Offensive Player of the Week and the win gave the Colts a 10–6 record as well as a wild card spot in the playoffs. In the wild card game, the Colts fell to the Dolphins 23–17 in overtime. Manning passed for 194 yards and a touchdown in the loss. He finished the season with  and  and was named Second-team All-Pro and to the Pro Bowl. At the Pro Bowl, Manning threw two touchdown passes. Manning and the Colts introduced their now-signature no-huddle offense, and used it to great effect in a Week 1 rout of the Jets, 45–24. Two weeks later (Week 2 games were not played as scheduled due to the 9/11 attacks) the Colts advanced to 2–0 with a win over Buffalo, behind Manning's 421&nbsp;yards passing.

The Colts briefly rebounded, winning two games, but then lost 7 of their last 9, including a 40–21 home loss to the 49ers.

On July 30, 2011, the Colts signed Manning to a 5-year, $90 million contract after negotiations in which he made it clear that he did not need to be the highest-paid player in the NFL. After a May 23 neck surgery, Manning could not use the Colts' facilities for practice and workouts due to the NFL lockout. Reluctant to have witnesses to his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team's trainers at Coors Field in Denver. Manning was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength had significantly diminished. Based on an MRI, doctors told him in the late summer that he needed spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee his return to the NFL. On September 7, the Colts officially ruled Manning out for the season opener against Houston, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. After seeking other opinions, Manning had the second surgery on September 8. Manning stated that while he did intend to play during the 2011 season, he would not "fight" the front office to stay off injured reserve if his roster spot was needed. Manning started practicing throwing footballs again in mid-December, with teammate Joseph Addai even claiming his passes looked "game ready."

In an emotional press conference, Manning told Colts fans, "Thank you for letting me be your quarterback." Upon his release, Colts owner Jim Irsay announced that no Colt will ever wear the No. 18 jersey again, though it has not been formally retired.  Manning reached an agreement with the Broncos on a five-year contract worth $96 million on March 20, 2012. Although No. 18 is retired in honor of Frank Tripucka, he gave Manning permission to wear it. On Thursday, August 9, 2012, Manning made his first appearance as a Bronco in a preseason game against the Chicago Bears, where he completed 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards, and was intercepted once by Bears safety Major Wright. Manning made his regular season debut as a Denver Bronco in the prime time game on the first Sunday of the 2012 NFL Season, against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the game, Manning completed 19 of 26 passes for 253 yards, 2 touchdowns, and no interceptions. He posted a 129.2 QB rating in the 31–19 win, and made history in the third quarter when he connected with Demaryius Thomas on a 71-yard touchdown pass. The touchdown was Manning's first in the NFL with a team other than the Colts, and marked the 400th of his career, making him the third quarterback, after Dan Marino and Brett Favre, to accomplish the feat and the fastest of the three to reach that mark. Despite the preseason concerns about his recovery, by late October ESPN stated that Manning "has silenced the critics" about his arm strength. Manning was later named to the 2013 Pro Bowl, his twelfth. On February 2, 2013, Manning was awarded the AP National Football League Comeback Player of the Year Award and was named a first-team All-Pro selection, in addition to finishing second in MVP voting. The Broncos made the playoffs, but lost 38–35 in double overtime to Baltimore, who went on to win Super Bowl XLVII that season. On the opening game of the 2013 NFL season, Manning became one of only six players in NFL history to throw seven touchdowns in a game, doing so against the defending Super Bowl XLVII champions, the Baltimore Ravens. He added to this feat by not throwing an interception, tying Y. A. Tittle as one of the only two players to have a 7:0 touchdown to interception ratio in a single game (although Nick Foles would later match that feat in week 9 of the same season). Against the Oakland Raiders in week three, Manning broke the record for most touchdown passes in the first three games of a season after throwing 12, surpassing Tom Brady's 2011 record. In Week 5, Manning threw his first interception of the season, in a win against the Dallas Cowboys. He was intercepted by Morris Claiborne. Two weeks later, Manning returned to Indianapolis for the first time in the regular season since being released by the Indianapolis Colts. In an emotional pregame ceremony, the Indianapolis Colts showed a tribute video to Manning. In Week 16 against the Houston Texans, Manning broke Brady's record for most touchdown passes in a season with 51 on a 25-yard touchdown pass to Julius Thomas, he finished the regular season with 55 touchdown passes, in addition to throwing for a league record 5,477 yards. His 450 completions are tied for second most all time. The Broncos scored an NFL record 606 points, becoming the first team ever to eclipse 600 points in a season. They had more 50-point games in a season than any other team in NFL history, with 3. Four Broncos receivers recorded at least ten touchdowns—an NFL record—and Manning set a season record with nine games with four or more touchdown passes. His 115.1 passer rating ranks fifth all time and he joined Tom Brady as the only two quarterbacks to achieve a passer rating of 110.0 or higher in more than one season. The Broncos went on to win their divisional round playoff game against the San Diego Chargers by a score of 24–17. They beat the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game by a score of 26-16, but lost to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII by a score of 43–8."Broncos lose to Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII, 43-8", nfl.com; accessed May 11, 2014. Manning set a Super Bowl record with 34 completions (broken by Tom Brady the following year in Super Bowl XLVIX), but the record-setting offense didn't record a first down until the 2nd quarter, and didn't score any points until the final seconds of the 3rd quarter. The Broncos' first play from scrimmage set the tone for the game. While Manning was stepping forward to call an audible, center Manny Ramirez snapped the ball too early. The ball went past Manning's head into the end zone, where running back Knowshon Moreno downed it for a safety. The Seahawks' number one ranked defense proved too much for the Broncos to overcome. While Manning threw one touchdown pass, he also threw two costly interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown. Manning is the third starting quarterback to have made it to the Super Bowl with more than one team, along with Craig Morton and Kurt Warner.  On August 28, 2014, Manning was fined $8,268 for taunting D. J. Swearinger during a preseason game against the Houston Texans. With the Broncos' win in their opening game of the 2014 NFL season against the Indianapolis Colts, Manning became, along with Brett Favre, one of only two starting quarterbacks in NFL history who have beaten all 32 teams. On October 5, 2014, Manning threw his 500th career touchdown pass to Julius Thomas against the Arizona Cardinals, and also tied Dan Marino for the most 400 yard games by a quarterback. On October 19, 2014, against the San Francisco 49ers, Manning threw his 509th career touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas, passing Brett Favre to become the NFL's all-time leader in passing touchdowns. By the end of the regular season, Manning would be selected to his 14th Pro Bowl appearance, tying him with Tony Gonzalez, Bruce Matthews, and Merlin Olsen for most Pro Bowl selections in a career. However, his season ended after the Broncos lost in the divisional round of the playoffs to his former team, the Indianapolis Colts, 24–13. After much speculation, Manning announced in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL. In the season opener, Manning's play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and 1 interception, but a pick-6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed the Broncos to win 19–13. The Broncos got off to a dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, the streak ended in a loss at Indianapolis, losing 24–27. During that winning streak, and the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played far better, putting up over 250 yards in 6 of the 7 games, and he scored 9 touchdowns, although he never had a game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13. In Week 10 against Kansas City, the game's biggest highlight was Manning breaking Brett Favre's record for career passing yards after a 4-yard pass to Ronnie Hillman in the first quarter. However, despite the accomplishment, he went 5-for-20 for 35 yards and four interceptions with a 0.0 passer rating before head coach Gary Kubiak benched Manning for the remainder of the game.  Brock Osweiler played the rest of the game as the Broncos would eventually lose 29–13. A day later, sources said that Manning had suffered a bout of plantar fasciitis. It was later announced that this injury would keep him out of Week 11, marking the first time Peyton has missed a game in a season he played. Osweiler replaced Manning and performed well in a 17–15 win over the Chicago Bears, leading to questions about whether Manning would retain his role when healthy in a Week 12 showdown against the New England Patriots. The next day, head coach Gary Kubiak, citing Manning's injuries, announced that Osweiler would start against New England. On December 15, it was announced that Osweiler would make his fifth consecutive start, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, even though Manning had returned to practice and the Broncos had gone seven straight quarters without scoring a touchdown on offense.Manning set to return to practice, Yahoo Sports]; accessed December 28, 2015.

In the third quarter, with the Broncos down 7-13, Manning entered the game in relief of Brock Osweiler, who had been intercepted twice and fumbled once. The Broncos went on to beat the Chargers, 27–20, and secure the top seed in the AFC. Despite the Bronco's 12-4 record (and Manning's 8-2 record in games that he played in), Manning had the worst season statistically of his career, as he threw a career low 9 touchdown passes and 17 interceptions in just 10 games, and posting a quarterback rating of 67.9, the lowest rating of his career.  Manning's 59.8 completion percentage was the second lowest of his career, only behind his rookie season. Manning's 17 interceptions were second to Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles, who threw 18 interceptions but started all 16 games. The Broncos earned home field advantage throughout the NFL playoffs. The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional round to advance to the Conference Championship game to host the defending Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots. It was the 17th meeting between Tom Brady's and Manning's teams. Despite a late comeback from the Patriots, the Broncos won 20-18 to advance to the Super Bowl. Manning was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Olivia (née Williams) and former NFL quarterback Archie Manning. Peyton married his wife, Ashley, in Memphis on St. Patrick's Day, 2001. A graduate of the University of Virginia, Ashley was introduced to him by her parents' next-door neighbor the summer before Manning's freshman year in college. Peyton and wife Ashley have twins, a boy and a girl. Manning is a Christian. At age 13, Manning said, "I committed my life to Christ, and that faith has been most important to me ever since." Manning said his priorities ranked in order are "...faith, family, friends, and football." Manning said he prays every night and before games and also said, "I hope (and pray) I don't do too many things that displease Him before I get to Heaven myself. I believe, too, that life is much better and freer when you're committed to God in that way." Manning reportedly has an excellent memory for plays. He memorized the Colts' playbook within a week after being drafted, and in 2012 was able to precisely recall the details and timing of a specific play he had used at Tennessee 16 years earlier. During the summer, Archie, Peyton, Eli, and eldest sibling Cooper run the Manning Passing Academy, a five-day camp which aims to improve the offensive skills of quarterbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, and running backs. In addition to the Mannings, the camp has included many prominent players from football as coaches, such as Colts wide receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne. Peyton, along with Archie, co-authored a book titled Manning: A Father, His Sons, and a Football Legacy, which was released in 2000. The book covers Archie's and Cooper's lives and careers, and Peyton's life and career up to the time that the book was released, and examines football from both Archie's and Peyton's points-of-view.  The book was the subject of criticism for Manning's remarks concerning the University of Tennessee trainer, whom he had been accused of sexually assaulting. The trainer sued Manning for defamation, although Manning later settled for an undisclosed amount.http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/colts/2003-11-04-manning-suit_x.htm Manning has donated over $8,000 to Republican politicians, among them Fred Thompson, Bob Corker, and former President George W.

An ESPN This is SportsCenter ad from 2006 features the entire Manning family; parents Archie and Olivia, with their sons Peyton, Eli and Cooper touring the SportsCenter studios with Peyton and Eli engaging in horseplay behind everybody. He appeared in one of a series of DirecTV commercials where celebrities are seen in their element, then suddenly begin addressing the viewer. In his commercial they parodied his pre-snap audible routine and known delay in calling for the ball by having him pitch NFL Sunday Ticket instead of changing the play during a blowout game against the Tennessee Titans. Manning also appears in advertisements for St. Mary's Medical Center in Knoxville, Tennessee. Manning hosted Saturday Night Live with musical guest Carrie Underwood on March 24, 2007, his 31st birthday. The episode earned the show's highest household rating in more than 10 months in the metered markets. During his opening, he alluded to his highly marketed status by joking that he had accomplished two of his life goals: his team, the Colts, winning a Super Bowl and his appearance on over half of America's television commercials. He has also won the Favorite Male Athlete award for the Kids Choice Awards. On May 27, 2007 Manning waved the green flag to begin the 91st Indianapolis 500. In 2009, Manning guest-voiced (with his brothers, Eli and Cooper) on an episode of The Simpsons called "O Brother, Where Bart Thou?" in which Bart dreams of having a baby brother and sees such famous brothers as The Marx Brothers, The Blues Brothers, The Wright Brothers, The Mario Brothers, and The Manning Brothers. Rapper O.T. Genasis mentions Peyton Manning in his 2014 song, "Touchdown". In May 2015, Manning appeared in the last Late Show with David Letterman, in the Top Ten List. Shortly after beginning his NFL career, Manning started his own charity called 'the Peyback Foundation'. The Peyback Foundation's mission is to help disadvantaged kids, and focuses its efforts in Louisiana, Tennessee, and Indiana. For his work with this foundation, Manning received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. Manning, along with his brother Eli, volunteered their assistance in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Among the tasks performed, the Mannings assisted in the delivery of 30,000 pounds of water, Gatorade, baby formula, diapers, and pillows to the people of New Orleans. In September 2007, St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis renamed its children's hospital to "Peyton Manning Children's Hospital at St. Vincent." Manning and his wife made a donation of an undisclosed amount to St. Vincent's and have had a relationship with the hospital since his arrival in Indianapolis. As of 2013, Peyton and Eli Manning's teams have played against each other three times in their professional careers. These encounters have been colloquially dubbed "The Manning Bowl", and as of 2013, Peyton's teams (twice with the Indianapolis Colts; once with the Denver Broncos) hold a 3-0 record over Eli's team (three games with the New York Giants). The first Manning Bowl was held on September 10, 2006, and Peyton's Colts defeated Eli's Giants by a score of 26–21. The second Manning Bowl, was held on September 19, 2010; Peyton and the Colts bested Eli's team again by a score of 38–14. The third Manning Bowl took place on September 15, 2013, and Peyton and the Broncos beat Eli's Giants, 41–23. In 1996, while attending the University of Tennessee, Manning, while being examined by a female trainer, pulled down his shorts as she bent over behind him to examine his foot to determine why it was hurting, and she has claimed he then sat on her face and proceeded to rub his anal area and testicles on her face until she pushed him up off of her. According to a court filing by the trainer's attorney, she reported Manning's actions to the Sexual Assault Crisis Center in Knoxville within hours. Manning apologized but claimed that he did not do everything the trainer alleged and that he was just mooning teammates across the room when she happened to be behind him. Despite Manning's denial, at least one eyewitness confirmed the trainer's account. In court documents filed by her attorney, the trainer also claimed that Manning later taunted her by re-enacting the incident on two occasions, called her a "bitch" when she attempted to give him a drug test, and threw a pen across the room that he was supposed to use to sign and date the drug test sample. The trainer later settled with the university for $300,000 for its alleged failure to properly handle the actions of Manning and others in various incidents, and she agreed to resign from the school. Manning then referred to the incident and described the trainer as having a "vulgar mouth" in his autobiography published in 2000, Manning: A Father, His Sons, and a Football Legacy, saying he was "crude, maybe, but harmless" in his conduct towards her. As a result of this comment, the trainer was demoted from her job as Program Director at Florida Southern College. The trainer sued for defamation, resulting in an undisclosed settlement in 2003 and a court-ordered gag on Manning and the trainer ever talking about the settlement or each other again. In denying a request for dismissal of the suit, Polk County Circuit Judge Harvey A. Kornstein stated "[e]ven if the plaintiff is a public figure, the evidence of the record contains sufficient evidence to satisfy the court that a genuine issue of material fact exists that would allow a jury to find, by clear and convincing evidence, the existence of actual malice of the part of the defendants", going on to say that "there is evidence of record, substantial enough to suggest that the defendants knew that the passages in question were false". In 2005, Manning was forced to re-settle again after violating the court's gag order by further discussing the incident and claiming she had taken advantage of him in an ESPN documentary special program about him. On December 27, 2015, Al Jazeera America released a report conducted by the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit investigating professional athletes' use of Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) which named Manning, among other prominent athletes, as having received illegal drugs from Charles Sly, a pharmacist who had worked at the Guyer Anti-Aging Clinic in Indianapolis during the fall of 2011. The report involved Liam Collins, a British hurdler, going undercover in an attempt to obtain banned substances from Sly and other medical professionals. The report claimed that Manning's wife, Ashley, had been shipped off label human growth hormone (HGH) by the Guyer Institute during the fall of 2011 while Manning was out with a severe neck injury, with the intention of hiding that Manning was the one actually receiving the drugs.  Sly told Collins during their conversations that "[a]ll the time we would be sending Ashley Manning drugs [...] Like growth hormone, all the time, everywhere, Florida. And it would never be under Peyton's name, it would always be under her name." http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/29/al-jazeera-reporter-stresses-that-no-allegation-is-being-made-against-peyton-manning/ It is illegal to prescribe HGH off label,[ ]  as the only legitimate ailments in which HGH can be prescribed to adults are for patients with childhood pituitary gland disorders which are carried over into adulthood, patients with Short bowel syndrome, and late-stage HIV patients.  HGH was outlawed by the NFL as part of the collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified on August 5, 2011.   The Indianapolis Star reported that in 2007 federal indictment was brought against Thomas Bader and College Pharmacy of Colorado Springs which alleged Guyer received Chinese HGH that was not approved by the FDA from College Pharmacy "on or around Feb. 22, 2007."  and that Bader was later found guilty in 2010 and sentenced to 40 months in prison for illegally importing human growth hormone from China and other charges related to his sale of HGH.http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_29327520/new-details-emerge-about-doctor-source-allegation-abouthttps://www.scribd.com/doc/294311244/USA-v-Bader-et-alhttp://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/12/29/peyton-manning-nfl-denver-broncos-hgh-ped-dale-guyer-institute/78025512/ Manning issued a statement stating, that he is "angry, furious [...] disgusted is really how I feel, sickened by [the allegations]". He told ESPN's Lisa Salter that he had visited the Guyer Institute 35 times during 2011 and that he had received both medication and treatment from Guyer during this time. Sly recanted his story and requested that the report not be aired via a YouTube video following the release of the report. Sly later claimed to ESPN that Collins had taken advantage of him during a vulnerable time in his life as Sly's fiancée had allegedly died, although Sly refers to his fiancée, "Karen", several times in the present tense during his conversations with Collins and gave no indication to Collins that she had died. Sly told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that he is not a pharmacist and was not at the Guyer Institute in 2011, as Al Jazeera claimed, but state licensing records indicate that someone named "Charles David Sly" was licensed as a pharmacy intern in Indiana from April 2010 to May 2013 and that his license expired May 1, 2013. Sly later stated that "[w]hen [he] was there, [he] had never seen the Mannings ever. They were not even living there at that time," and that "[s]omeone who worked there said they had been there before. That was the extent of any knowledge I had. I feel badly. I never saw any files. This is just amazing that it reached this point." An employee at the Guyer Institute named "Heather" later confirmed to Al Jazeera investigative reporter Deborah Davies who called the clinic to request an "employment verification" that Sly had worked at the clinic during the "fall of 2011" and confirmed that his start date was October 17, 2011. On December 28, 2015, both the NFL and MLB both initiated investigations into the allegations made by Sly. Al Jazeera America reported on January 3, 2016, that the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit were in contact with a second source, who was "impeccably placed, knowledgable, and credible" and was a former employee at the Guyer Institute, which confirms Sly's allegation that HGH was sent to Ashley Manning.http://deadspin.com/al-jazeera-reporter-second-knowledgable-and-credible-1750778458?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&utm_source=deadspin_twitter&utm_medium=socialflowhttp://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_29338568/al-jazeera-reporter-says-second-source-confirmed-hgh On January 26, 2016, it was reported that the USADA had joined with the MLB to investigate the allegations made by Sly, but that the NFL was refusing to cooperate with the joint MLB and USADA investigation.  http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14652385/mlb-asks-us-anti-doping-agency-help-investigate-al-jazeera-claims  The NFL later denied the reports, stating that the "NFL has worked with USADA & MLB from the start.".  http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/01/26/nfl-disputes-report-of-non-cooperation-with-mlb-usada-in-manning-probe/  League leader  Year in which Manning won the NFL MVP Award     Additionally, Manning has been named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month a record eight times (9/2003, 11/2004, 10/2006, 9/2009, 9/2012, 10/2012, 9/2013, 12/2013) and Offensive Player of the Week a record 26 times (25 AFC, 1 NFL/playoff).
