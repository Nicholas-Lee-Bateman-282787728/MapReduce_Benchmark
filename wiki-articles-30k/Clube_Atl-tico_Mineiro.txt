    Clube Atlético Mineiro (), commonly known as Atlético Mineiro or Atlético, and colloquially as Galo (, "Rooster") is a professional football club based in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The club plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the top tier of the Brazilian football league system, as well as in the Campeonato Mineiro, the premier state league of Minas Gerais. Atlético Mineiro is the oldest active football club in Minas Gerais. The club was founded on 25 March 1908 by twenty-two students from Belo Horizonte, led by Margival Mendes Leal and Mário Toledo. Despite having liberal, upper-class founders, the club opened its doors to players of every social class, establishing itself as a "people's club", and becoming one of the best supported in Brazil. Atlético has won the Campeonato Mineiro a record 43 times. At national level, the club has won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A once and has finished second on five occasions. Atlético has also won one Copa do Brasil, one Copa dos Campeões Estaduais and the Copa dos Campeões Brasileiros. In international club football, Atlético has won the Copa Libertadores once, the Recopa Sudamericana once and the Copa CONMEBOL twice, more than any other club. The team has also reached three other continental finals. The club plays the majority of its home matches at Estádio Independência, which holds up to 23,018 spectators. Mineirão, the club's ground for most of its history, is used as the team's home in important and high-attendance matches, holding 62,160 people. Atlético has a long-standing rivalry with Cruzeiro, with matches between the two teams known as the Clássico Mineiro. The club also holds an interstate rivalry with Flamengo, and a local one with América Mineiro. The team's regular home kit comprises black-and-white striped shirts, with black shorts and white socks. The club's mascot, a rooster, has been strongly associated with Atlético since its introduction in the 1940s. Over the years, the word galo (Portuguese for "rooster") became a common nickname for the club itself. Atlético has the ninth most valuable brand in Brazil, worth  million (€122.7 million), and ranks eighth in the country in terms of turnover, generating R$178.9 million in 2014 (€55.6 million). The club has also competed in other sports throughout its history, with the futsal department becoming especially notable. Atlético Mineiro was formed on 25 March 1908 by a group of twenty-two students from Belo Horizonte, who decided the club's name would be Athletico Mineiro Foot Ball Club. The club's first match was played against Sport Club Futebol on 21 March 1909; Atlético won 3–0, with the first goal scored by Aníbal Machado. In 1913, the club's name was officially changed to Clube Atlético Mineiro, and in the following year Atlético won the Taça Bueno Brandão, the first competition ever held in the state of Minas Gerais. In 1915, the club won the inaugural edition of the Campeonato Mineiro, the state league of Minas Gerais. The competition was then organised by the Liga Mineira de Sports Athléticos, which would later become the Federação Mineira de Futebol. América won the next ten editions of the Mineiro, and Atlético only won the league again in 1926, led by striker Mário de Castro. In 1927, forwards Said and Jairo joined Castro to form an attacking partnership nicknamed the Trio Maldito ("Unholy Trio"), which guided Atlético to another state league triumph. In 1929, the club played its first international encounter against Vitória de Setúbal, winning 3–1 in a match played at the Presidente Antônio Carlos Stadium. The ground had opened earlier that year, and would be the club's home for the following two decades. Atlético won the state league in 1931 and 1932, before becoming a professional club in 1933. After another Campeonato Mineiro triumph in 1936, Atlético won the Copa dos Campeões Estaduais in 1937, its first title at national level. The competition was organised by the Federação Brasileira de Foot-Ball, a federation for professional clubs that would later merge into the Brazilian Sports Confederation (CBD). The Copa dos Campeões Estaduais was contested by the 1936 state league champions from Minas Gerais (Atlético), Rio de Janeiro (Fluminense), São Paulo (Portuguesa) and Espírito Santo (Rio Branco). Atlético defeated the latter 5–1 in the final match, played at the Antônio Carlos stadium. The title was followed by two more Campeonato Mineiro victories, in 1938 and 1939. Success continued in the 1940s, with a squad that included Carlyle, Lucas Miranda, Nívio Gabrich and goalkeeper Kafunga. The club was dominant in the state as it won the league in 1941, 1942, 1946, 1947 and 1949. Although América had been Atlético's long-standing adversary, a new rivalry started to develop with Cruzeiro in the 1940s, as it became Galo's main challenger during this period.  In 1950, the club's home moved from the Antônio Carlos to the newer and larger Estádio Independência. The season saw another Campeonato Mineiro triumph and the club's first European tour, in which it played ten games in five countries. The excursion happened at a time when there were neither regular national competitions in Brazil nor continental ones in South America, and followed soon after the traumatic Maracanazo. The tour and Atlético's results, many of which achieved under adverse weather conditions and snow, were seen by national sports media as a historic achievement for Brazilian football itself. The team was dubbed the Campeões do Gelo ("Ice Champions"), a title that is remembered in the club's official anthem. The club's success in the state competition continued in the 1950s with five consecutive Campeonato Mineiro victories from 1952 to 1956, and another in 1958. In 1959, Atlético took part in the inaugural edition of the Taça Brasil, reaching the third round. The tournament, the country's first annual nationwide competition, was a cup contested between state league champions, originally created by the CBD to select Brazil's entrants in the newly formed Copa Libertadores. In the 1960s, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro twice, in 1962 and 1963, but failed to advance to the later stages of the Taça Brasil. Mineirão, Belo Horizonte's new stadium, opened in 1965 and immediately became the club's home. It was in the mid-1960s that the rivalry with Cruzeiro became the biggest in the state, after this club won the first five state leagues of the Mineirão era. In 1967, another national-level competition was created by the CBD, the Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa. It included more clubs than the Taça Brasil, but Atlético did not finish in the top-four in any of its editions in the decade. In the second half of the 1960s, highlights came in the form of friendlies against national sides. In 1968, Atlético, representing the Brazilian national team, defeated European Championship runners-up Yugoslavia 3–2 at the Mineirão. The following year, the Seleção itself, which would become champions of the 1970 FIFA World Cup, was defeated by Atlético 2–1. With the arrival of Telê Santana as the club's head coach in 1970, Atlético broke Cruzeiro's sequence and won its first state league title in the Mineirão, also finishing third in the last Roberto Gomes Pedrosa. In 1971, led by midfielder Oldair and World Cup-winning forward Dadá Maravilha, the club won the Campeonato Brasileiro. It was the first edition of the competition, also known as the Brasileirão, which replaced both the Taça Brasil and the Roberto Gomes Pedrosa as the new national championship. Atlético played a final group stage against São Paulo and Botafogo, defeating the former 1–0 at the Mineirão and the latter 1–0 at the Maracanã. The victory also secured the club's first participation in an official continental competition, the 1972 Copa Libertadores, in which it did not advance past the first group stage. After four trophyless years, Atlético won the state league again in 1976 and finished third in the Campeonato Brasileiro. That season saw the emergence of a golden generation of players, formed in the club's youth academies under coach Barbatana. Reinaldo, Toninho Cerezo, Éder, Luisinho, Paulo Isidoro and João Leite, players who represented Brazil at international level, were central to the team that took Atlético to six consecutive state league victories between 1978 and 1983, and to good results in the Série A. Atlético came second in the 1977 Brasileirão, losing the final to São Paulo in a penalty shootout at the Mineirão, despite remaining undefeated for the entire season. Reinaldo, the league's top scorer in that season with an average of 1.56 goals per match, was banned from the final. By his account, this was because of his insistence on celebrating his goals by raising his fist, a political symbol that opposed the Brazilian military government of the time. In 1978, Atlético reached the Copa Libertadores semi-finals and won the Copa dos Campeões Brasileiros, a tournament organised by the CBD between past winners of the Brasileirão. In a repetition of the previous year's Brasileiro decisive match, the opponent in the final of this competition was São Paulo, with Atlético this time winning a penalty shootout.  In 1980, after having the best record in the first stages of the Brasileirão, Atlético lost to Flamengo in a controversial final of the competition. Three Atlético players were sent off, among them Reinaldo, who received a straight red card after scoring twice. The team was then eliminated from the following year's Copa Libertadores undefeated, in another decisive match marked by controversy: a play-off against Flamengo that ended after 37 minutes, following the sendings-off of five Atlético players. During the 1980s, the club participated in and won international friendly competitions, such as the Amsterdam Tournament and the Tournoi de Paris. Atlético had the best statistic league records of the 1980, 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1987 Brasileirão seasons, but did not win the title, falling in the finals or semi-finals of those editions. In the second half of the decade, the club continued its success in the state, winning the Campeonato Mineiro in 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1989. Atlético was one of Brazil's top sides of the 1980s, providing many players to the Brazilian national team, being dominant at state level and having good performances in the Brasileirão, but failed to win the competition due to a tendency to lose in its final knockout stages. In the following decade, Atlético won the state league in 1991 and saw success at international level in 1992, when it won the inaugural Copa CONMEBOL, its first official international title, defeating Olimpia in the finals. As champion of that competition, the club took part in the 1993 Copa de Oro, in which it eliminated rivals Cruzeiro in the semi-finals but eventually lost to Boca Juniors. After finishing fourth in the 1994 Brasileirão, the following year saw the club win the state league and reach the finals of the Copa CONMEBOL for a second time, this one ending in defeat to Rosario Central. In 1996, Atlético participated in the Copa Masters CONMEBOL, a competition between past winners of the Copa CONMEBOL that was played in Cuiabá; Atlético eliminated Rosario Central in the semi-finals but lost to São Paulo in the final match. The team also finished third in that year's Brasileiro and fourth in the following edition, falling in the semi-finals of both seasons. Another triumph came in the 1997 Copa CONMEBOL, when an Atlético team that included Marques and Cláudio Taffarel defeated Lanús in the finals, and won the trophy for a second time. In 1999, after another Campeonato Mineiro title, an Atlético side led by Marques and Guilherme, the top scorer in the league, reached the Série A finals for the fourth time, but lost to Corinthians. Despite international success and good performances in the Série A, the decade was marked by bad club management by Atlético's presidents and deteriorating finances, which made the club one of the most indebted in Brazilian football. In 2000, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro, reached the Copa Libertadores quarter-finals and the semi-finals of Copa Mercosur, but had a bad season in the national league, the Copa João Havelange. The following year, despite a good performance in the Brasileirão with a squad that included Marques, Guilherme and Gilberto Silva, the team once again was eliminated in the competition's semi-finals, eventually finishing in fourth place. Atlético then finished in the upper part of the national league table in the following two seasons, but in 2004 it barely escaped relegation. In 2005 the club was demoted to the Série B, the second level of the Brasileirão. The club was promoted straight back up as Série B champion in 2006, returning to the Série A for the 2007 season. That year, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro, its first trophy in seven years, and finished eighth in the national league. Alexandre Kalil was chosen as the club's new president in 2008, and tried to improve its finances and status. In 2009, with Diego Tardelli in good form, Atlético led the Brasileirão for eight of the thirty-eight rounds, before eventually finishing in seventh place. Despite some highlights at the beginning and end of the decade, the 2000s were not a successful period in the club's history, marked once again by bad administration and frequent managerial changes. The team won its 40th Campeonato Mineiro in 2010, but finished 13th in the Série A. After an unsuccessful year in 2011, coming close to relegation, the arrival of Cuca as head coach at the end of that season marked the beginning of another successful era for the club. The club moved back to the Independência in 2012, as the Mineirão was closed for renovation, and won the Campeonato Mineiro undefeated. The arrival of Ronaldinho in the middle of the season was an important event for the club, which eventually finished as runner-up in the Série A and earned a spot in the following year's Copa Libertadores. 2013 saw the return of Tardelli and Gilberto Silva to the club, who joined Ronaldinho, Jô and Bernard towards another Campeonato Mineiro triumph. An iconic moment for Atlético happened in the second leg of that season's Copa Libertadores's quarter-finals, when a penalty kick was awarded to Club Tijuana in injury time. It would have meant elimination if it had been scored, but was saved by Atlético's goalkeeper Victor with his foot. The save, according to sports commentators and fans, represented the kicking out of the club's historic "bad luck". After defeating Newell's Old Boys in the semi-finals in a penalty shootout, following a 2–0 first leg defeat and a 2–0 home win, the club faced Olimpia in the finals. Atlético again lost the first leg by 2–0 and won the second by 2–0 after extra-time at the Mineirão; in the subsequent penalty shootout, Atlético won 4–3 to claim its first Libertadores title. The club's participation in the FIFA Club World Cup was unsuccessful, however, as it failed to reach the finals after losing to Raja Casablanca; Atlético eventually finished in third place after defeating Guangzhou Evergrande. Atlético won its first Recopa Sudamericana in 2014, after once again meeting Lanús in a continental final, which finished 5–3 on aggregate after extra-time. In that season's Copa do Brasil quarter-finals against Corinthians and semi-finals against Flamengo, Atlético lost the first leg 2–0 and conceded first in the second one. The team managed to make 4–1 comebacks in both stages to advance. The competition's finals were the first at national level to feature both Belo Horizonte rivals, and Atlético defeated Cruzeiro twice to win its first Copa do Brasil. The club's successful run in the decade continued in 2015, when it won its 43rd Campeonato Mineiro and finished second in the Campeonato Brasileiro. The club's first emblem, introduced in the 1910s, consisted of a simple design of the three initials of the club's name ("CAM" for Clube Atlético Mineiro) in an oval shape in black. The first and most significant change occurred in 1922, when a Swiss escutcheon was adopted, with the letters in its upper part and black and white stripes in the lower. The crest's general appearance has been kept ever since, with only the exact format and the placement of the black and white stripes within the escutcheon changing over the decades. In the 1970s a golden star above the badge was introduced, alluding to the 1971 Série A title, which still remains. Red stars were featured on two occasions, referring to the 1978 Copa dos Campeões and the 1992 and 1997 Copa CONMEBOL victories, but these were removed in 1999. Atlético's mascot, a rooster, is one of the best-known in the country. It was created in the 1945 by Fernando Pierucetti, a cartoonist for the A Folha de Minas newspaper. Pierucetti, known as Mangabeira, was selected to design a mascot for each of the three biggest clubs in Belo Horizonte. According to Mangabeira, Atlético's would be the rooster because the team used to play with passion and would never give up until the end of each match, like gamecocks in cockfights. According to Kafunga, who played as goalkeeper for the club since before the introduction of Mangabeira's mascot in the 1940s, the "rooster" nickname was already associated with Atlético because of its kit colours. Over the years the word galo (Portuguese for "rooster") became a cheering chant for the supporters and a nickname by which they referred to the club, an appellation that eventually spread to other football fans in the country. The nickname made its way into the club's official anthem, composed by Vicente Motta in 1968; the chorus hails Atlético as a "strong and avenging rooster". In 1976, a costumed rooster mascot was introduced, to accompany players and children in the match entrance. The stadium mascot was reintroduced with a new costume in 2005, named Galo Doido ("Crazy Rooster") by the supporters. The club's home kit has always consisted of a black-and-white vertically striped shirt, with black shorts and white or black socks. The width of the black and white stripes has varied from season to season, as has the colour of the shirt numbers, which have usually been red, black, white or yellow. Atlético's traditional away kit is all-white shirts, shorts and socks, but has had slight variations. An all-black third kit was introduced in the 2000 season, being used again in 2015. In 2008, a black-and-gold vertically striped third kit was launched to commemorate the club's centenary, featuring the first crest. Squad number 12 is retired from the club's kits, dedicated to the fans. Since the 1981 season, the club has had its kits manufactured by sportswear corporations, the first one being Brazilian company Rainha. Atlético's kits have been manufactured since 2014 by Puma, which is contracted to supply the team until the end of the 2015 season. Previously, the kits were manufactured by Adidas (1983–85), Penalty (1986–90, 1992–93 and 1997–2001), Dell'erba (1991), Umbro (1994–96 and 2002–04), Diadora (2005–07), Lotto (2008–09), Topper (2010–12) and Lupo (2013). In 1982, bank Credireal was Atlético's first shirt sponsor. After one sponsorless season in 1983, Precon, a construction company, appeared on the shirts in 1984 and 1985; it was replaced by Agrimisa bank in 1986. In 1987, Coca-Cola sponsored all participating clubs of Copa União, and the brand remained on Atlético's kits until 1994. The club was subsequently sponsored by TAM Airlines (1995–96), Tenda (1997–98), and had temporary deals with Fiat and Telemar in 1999. Two sponsorless years followed, before permanent deals were signed with Fiat (2002–03), MRV Engenharia (2004–07) and Fiat again in 2008. After one more season without a brand on the club's shirts, BMG, a bank that was owned by the former club president Ricardo Annes Guimarães, was the main sponsor from 2010 to 2014. MRV Engenharia returned as the club's main shirt sponsor in 2015.    Atlético had its first home ground built in 1912 at Paraopeba Avenue, in downtown Belo Horizonte, across the street from América's first stadium. The club's main ground for most of its early years, however, was the Presidente Antônio Carlos stadium, which held 5,000 people; it was nicknamed Estádio de Lourdes for the quarter in which it was located. The Antônio Carlos was one of the first stadiums in Brazil to feature floodlights, and opened on 30 May 1929 with a friendly against Corinthians, won by Atlético 4–2. The following year, the stadium was visited by FIFA president Jules Rimet, who watched a night game for the first time. The stadium fell out of favour when the larger Independência was built in 1950, and remained largely unused by the first team; eventually it was sold by the club to the Belo Horizonte municipality in the 1960s. After decades of legal disputes with the municipal government, the property returned to the club in 1991. It was leased to a shopping mall in 1995, which was built in the following year where the stadium once was, across the street from Atlético's administrative headquarters.  Construction for the Independência (officially Estádio Raimundo Sampaio) started in 1947 in preparation for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, during which its first match was played. Originally the property of the Government of Minas Gerais, ownership was transferred to Sete de Setembro FC in 1965, when the Mineirão was built, and the property passed to América in 1997, when it absorbed Sete de Setembro. Before the Mineirão, the stadium was the largest in Belo Horizonte&nbsp;– holding up to 30,000 people&nbsp;– and was preferred by Atlético over the older and smaller Antônio Carlos stadium. After the Mineirão's construction, however, Atlético did not use the Independência for decades, except for a brief spell in the late 1990s. The stadium was renovated in 2012, while the Mineirão was closed, and in that year Atlético announced a deal with BWA, the stadium manager. The club signed a contract to use the stadium as its home ground for 10 years, which has happened since then, except in important and high-attendance matches.  Mineirão (officially Estádio Governador Magalhães Pinto) opened in 1965, and quickly became the home of both Atlético and Cruzeiro, as its peak capacity of over 100,000 spectators surpassed any other stadium in Belo Horizonte or in the state. The property of the state of Minas Gerais, Mineirão was Atlético's home from its opening until it closed in 2010 for renovations prior to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The club temporarily moved to Arena do Jacaré in Sete Lagoas and subsequently to Independência in 2012. Historically the club's home ground, Atlético's most important matches have all been played at the Mineirão, a fact that has continued even after Independência became the first-choice home stadium again. After the renovation, the Mineirão has an overall capacity of 62,160. Cidade do Galo ("Rooster City"), the club's main training facility since 2001, has been lauded as the best in Brazil and is considered one of the best in the world. It hosted the Argentina national football team at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Other facilities owned by the club include Vila Olímpica ("Olympic Village"), the old training grounds opened in 1973 that hosted the Seleção in its preparation for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and Labareda, a leisure and health club in Belo Horizonte. In 2015, Daniel Nepomuceno, the club president, announced that Atlético had a four-year project to build a new stadium in Belo Horizonte, with a 45,000 capacity.  Atlético Mineiro was founded by liberal, upper-class students, but from an early age it opened its doors to players from every social class, nationality or ethnicity, which earned it a "people's club" status in Belo Horizonte and in the state. América, meanwhile, had a reputation as an elitist club and Cruzeiro was strongly associated with the local Italian colony. As a result of the popular support, the fans came to be collectively known as "A Massa" (Portuguese for "the mass"). According to a 2014 survey conducted by IBOPE and Lance!, the club is the best-supported in Belo Horizonte and in Minas Gerais, and has the 6th largest fanbase in Brazil, with seven million supporters. A 2014 survey by Datafolha, however, shows Atlético as the second best-supported club in Minas Gerais and 10th in Brazil. Atlético has many torcidas organizadas that support the club, the oldest being Dragões da FAO, founded in 1969, and the largest and best-known being Galoucura. Other notable groups include Galö Metal, Movimento 105 Minutos and the Charanga, a brass band that plays during the club's home matches. Galoucura has historically developed alliances with other torcidas in Brazil, most notably Palmeiras's Mancha Verde and Vasco da Gama's Força Jovem. After difficult but successful comebacks in 2013 and 2014, the fans have adopted the motto "Eu acredito" ("I believe") to support the club in against-the-odds situations. Squad number 12 is retired from the club's kits and dedicated to the fans. Atlético has had the best average attendance in nine editions of the Série A since 1972, and has the second highest all-time average attendance in Brazilian football. The club also ranks second in all-time total attendance in the national league, with more than 13 million tickets sold in 581 home matches as of the 2014 season. The second leg of the 2013 Copa Libertadores finals between Atlético and Olimpia, played at the Mineirão and attended by 58,620 people, had the highest gate receipt revenue of all time in South American football, yielding  million (€4.8 million at the time). In 1999, the club introduced Galo de Prata ("Silver Rooster"), a trophy officially awarded by Atlético to sportspeople, illustrious supporters, artists, politicians, and organisations that somehow promote the club's name. Since the implementation of municipal and state laws in 2007 and 2008, Dia do Atleticano ("Atleticano Day") is officially celebrated in Belo Horizonte and Minas Gerais every year on 25 March, the day of the club's foundation. Atlético launched TV Galo in 2007, a premium television channel that provides content for fans such as interviews with players and staff, coverage of training sessions and matches, footballing news, and other themed programming. Since 2012, the club has an affiliation programme called Galo na Veia, in which supporters can become season ticket holders or pay monthly fees to buy match tickets at reduced price.  The local rivalry between Atlético and Cruzeiro, known as the Clássico Mineiro ("Mineiro Derby"), exists since Cruzeiro's foundation (as Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Itália) in 1921. It strengthened in the 1940s, and became the biggest derby in Minas Gerais in the 1960s. Atlético dominated the rivalry from its early days until the 1950s, but Cruzeiro rose in the 1960s to be a strong challenger, and the 1970s had divided honours. The 1980s were dominated by Atlético, while the 1990s and 2000s were favourable to Cruzeiro. In the 2010s, Atlético achieved an eleven-game undefeated run against its rival, running from 2013 to 2015. The clubs dissent over the number of matches and head-to-head record of the Clássico Mineiro, but both team's statistics show Atlético with most wins in the encounter. The only national final between the two clubs happened in the 2014 Copa do Brasil, when Atlético triumphed in a final match played at the Mineirão.
