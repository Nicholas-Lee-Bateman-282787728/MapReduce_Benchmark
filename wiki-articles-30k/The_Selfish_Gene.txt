         The Selfish Gene is a book on evolution by Richard Dawkins, published in 1976. It builds upon the principal theory of George C. Williams's first book Adaptation and Natural Selection. Dawkins used the term "selfish gene" as a way of expressing the gene-centered view of evolution as opposed to the views focused on the organism and the group, popularizing ideas developed during the 1960s by W. D. Hamilton and others. From the gene-centered view follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other. This should not be confused with misuse of the term along the lines of a selfishness gene. An organism is expected to evolve to maximize its inclusive fitness—the number of copies of its genes passed on globally (rather than by a particular individual). As a result, populations will tend towards an evolutionarily stable strategy. The book also coins the term meme for a unit of human cultural evolution analogous to the gene, suggesting that such "selfish" replication may also model human culture, in a different sense. Memetics has become the subject of many studies since the publication of the book. In the foreword to the book's 30th-anniversary edition, Dawkins said he "can readily see that [the book's title] might give an inadequate impression of its contents" and in retrospect thinks he should have taken Tom Maschler's advice and called the book The Immortal Gene. The Selfish Gene builds upon George C. Williams's book Adaptation and Natural Selection, which argued that altruism is not based upon group benefit per se, but is a result of selection that occurs "at the level of the gene mediated by the phenotype" and any selection at the group level occurred only under rare circumstances. This approach was developed further during the 1960s by W. D. Hamilton and others who opposed group selection and selection aimed directly at benefit to the individual organism: "Despite the principle of 'survival of the fittest' the ultimate criterion which determines whether [a gene] G will spread is not whether the behavior is to the benefit of the behaver, but whether it is to the benefit of the gene G...With altruism this will happen only if the affected individual is a relative of the altruist, therefore having an increased chance of carrying the gene. :— W.D. Hamilton, The evolution of altruistic behavior pp. 354-355 An extended discussion of Dawkins' views and his book The Selfish Gene is provided by Wilkins and Hull. In describing genes as being "selfish", the author does not intend (as he states unequivocally) to imply that they are driven by any motives or will, but merely that their effects can be metaphorically and pedagogically described as if they were. The contention is that the genes that are passed on are the ones whose evolutionary consequences serve their own implicit interest (to continue the anthropomorphism) in being replicated, not necessarily those of the organism. In later work, Dawkins brings evolutionary "selfishness" down to creation of a widely proliferated extended phenotype. For some, the metaphor of "selfishness" is entirely clear, while to others it is confusing, misleading, or simply silly to ascribe mental attributes to something that is mindless. For example, Andrew Brown has written: "“Selfish”, when applied to genes, doesn't mean “selfish” at all. It means, instead, an extremely important quality for which there is no good word in the English language: “the quality of being copied by a Darwinian selection process.” This is a complicated mouthful. There ought to be a better, shorter word—but “selfish” isn't it." Donald Symons also finds it inappropriate to use anthropomorphism in conveying scientific meaning in general and particularly for the present instance: "In summary, the rhetoric of The Selfish Gene exactly reverses the real situation: through [the use of] metaphor genes are endowed with properties only sentient beings can possess, such as selfishness, while sentient beings are stripped of these properties and called machines...The anthropomorphism of genes...obscures the deepest mystery in the life sciences: the origin and nature of mind." Dawkins proposes the idea of the "replicator":   "It is finally time to return to the problem with which we started, to the tension between individual organism and gene as rival candidates for the central role in natural selection...One way of sorting this whole matter out is to use the terms ‘replicator’ and ‘vehicle’. The fundamental units of natural selection, the basic things that survive or fail to survive, that form lineages of identical copies with occasional random mutations, are called replicators. DNA molecules are replicators. They generally, for reasons that we shall come to, gang together into large communal survival machines or ‘vehicles’." :— Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, p. 253 (Anniversary Edition) The original replicator (Dawkins' Replicator) was the initial molecule which first managed to reproduce itself and thus gained an advantage over other molecules within the primordial soup.   As replicating molecules became more complex, Dawkins postulates, the replicators became the genes within organisms, with each organism's body serving the purpose of a 'survival machine' for its genes. Dawkins writes that gene combinations which help an organism to survive and reproduce tend to also improve the gene's own chances of being replicated  and, as a result, frequently "successful" genes can reflect a benefit to the organism. An example of this might be a gene that protects the organism against a disease, which helps the gene spread and also helps the organism. There are other times when the implicit interests of the vehicle and replicator are in conflict, such as the genes behind certain male spiders' instinctive mating behaviour, which increase the organism's inclusive fitness by allowing it to reproduce, but shorten its life by exposing it to the risk of being eaten by the cannibalistic female. Another good example is the existence of segregation distorter genes that are detrimental to their host but nonetheless propagate themselves at its expense. Likewise, the persistence of junk DNA that provides no benefit to its host can be explained on the basis that it is not subject to selection. These unselected for but transmitted DNA variations connect the individual genetically to its parents, but confer no survival benefit. These examples might suggest that there is a power-struggle between genes and their interactor. In fact, the claim is that there isn't much of a struggle because the genes usually win without a fight. However, the claim is made, if the organism becomes intelligent enough to understand its own interests, as distinct from those of its genes, there can be true conflict. An example of such a conflict might be a person using birth control to prevent fertilization, thereby inhibiting the replication of his or her genes. But this action might not be a conflict of the 'self-interest' of the organism with his or her genes, since a person using birth control might also be enhancing the survival chances of their genes by limiting family size to conform with available resources, thus avoiding extinction as predicted under the Malthusian model of population growth. Dawkins says that in writing The Selfish Gene "My purpose is to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism." p. 1 He does this by supporting the claim that "gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour. However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of altruism at the level of individual animals." p. 2 Gene selection provides one explanation for kin selection and eusociality, where organisms act altruistically, against their individual interests (in the sense of health, safety or personal reproduction), namely the argument that by helping related organisms reproduce, a gene succeeds in "helping" copies of themselves (or sequences with the same phenotypic effect) in other bodies to replicate. The claim is made that these "selfish" actions of genes lead to unselfish actions by organisms. An interesting requirement upon this claim, supported by Dawkins in Chapter 10: You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours by examples from nature, is the need to explain how genes achieve kin recognition, or manage to orchestrate mutualism and coevolution. Although Dawkins (and biologists in general) recognize these phenomena result in more copies of a gene, evidence is inconclusive whether this success is selected for at a group or individual level. In fact, Dawkins has proposed that it is at the level of the extended phenotype:   "We agree [referring to Wilson and Sober's book Unto others: The evolution and psychology of unselfish behavior] that genes are replicators, organisms and groups are not. We agree that the group selection controversy ought to be a controversy about groups as vehicles, and we could easily agree to differ on the answer...I coined the [term] vehicle not to praise it but to bury it....Darwinism can work on replicators whose phenotypic effects (interactors) are too diffuse, too multi-levelled, too incoherent to deserve the accolade of vehicle...Extended phenotypes can include inanimate artifacts like beaver dams...But the vehicle is not something fundamental...Ask rather “Is there a vehicle in this situation and, if so, why?”" ::—Richard Dawkins, ''Burying the Vehicle''  Although Dawkins agrees that groups can assist survival, they rank as a 'vehicle' for survival only if the group activity is replicated in descendants, recorded in the gene, the gene being only true replicator. An improvement in the survival lottery for the group must improve that for the gene for sufficient replication to occur. Dawkins argues qualitatively that the lottery for the gene is based upon a very long and broad record of events, and group advantages are usually too specific, too brief, and too fortuitous to change the gene lottery. ::"We can now see that the organism and the group of organisms are true rivals for the vehicle role in the story, but neither of them is even a ''candidate'' for the replicator role.  The controversy between ‘individual selection’ and ‘group selection’ is a real controversy between alternative vehicles...As it happens the outcome, in my view, is a decisive victory for the individual organism. The group is too wishy-washy an entity."  ::—Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&pg=PA254&dq=%22We+can+now+see+that+the+organism+and+the+group+of+organisms+are+true+rivals+%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=u8_5VN_VI4uZNvaIgYAO&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22We%20can%20now%20see%20that%20the%20organism%20and%20the%20group%20of%20organisms%20are%20true%20rivals%20%22&f=false pp. 254-255]  Prior to the 1960s, it was common for altruism to be explained in terms of [[group selection]], where the benefits to the organism or even population were supposed to account for the popularity of the genes responsible for the tendency towards that behaviour.

The proven best way in evolutionary biology, as in most of science, is to define a problem arising during empirical research, then select or devise the theory that is needed to solve it. Almost all research in inclusive-fitness theory has been the opposite:  hypothesize the key roles of kinship and kin selection, then look for evidence to test that hypothesis."

Thompson quotes Sarkar:<ref name="Sarkar"/> :"there is no clear technical notion of "information" in molecular biology. It is little more than a metaphor that masquerades as a theoretical concept and ...leads to a misleading picture of the nature of possible explanations in molecular biology." ::— Sahotra Sarkar ''Biological information: a skeptical look at some central dogmas of molecular biology'', p. 187  Thompson follows with a detailed examination of the concept of DNA as a look-up-table and the role of the cell in orchestrating the DNA-to-RNA transcription, indicating that by anyone's account the DNA is hardly the whole story. Thompson goes on to suggest that the cell-environment interrelationship has much to do with reproduction and inheritance, and a focus on the gene as a form of "information [that] passes through bodies and affects them, but is not affected by them on its way through"<ref name=DawkinsRE1>{{cite book |title= River out of Eden: A Darwinian View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmKvnPyBSoC&pg=PA4 |page=4 |isbn=9780786724260 |publisher=Basic Books  |year=2008 |edition=Paperback reprint of 1995 }}</ref> is tantamount to adoption of a form of material-informational dualism that has no explanatory value and no scientific basis. (Thomson, p.&nbsp;187) The [[Enactivism|enactivist]] view, however, is that information results from the probing and experimentation of the agent with the agent's environment subject to the limitations of the agent's abilities to probe and process the result of probing, and DNA is simply one mechanism the agent brings to bear upon its activity.  ===Moral arguments=== Another criticism of the book is its treatment of morality, and more particularly altruism, as existing only as a form of selfishness: :"It is important to realize that the above definitions of altruism and selfishness are ''behavioural'', not subjective. I am not concerned here with the psychology of motives...My definition is concerned only with whether the effect of an act is to lower or raise the survival prospects of the presumed altruist and the survival prospects of the presumed beneficiary."  ::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', p. 12  :"We can even discuss ways of cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism, something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world." ::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', p. 179  Philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] has suggested this position is a variant of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes']] explanation of altruism as [[enlightened self-interest]], and that Dawkins goes a step further to suggest that our genetic programming can be overcome by what amounts to an extreme version of [[free will]].<ref name=Midgley/> Part of Mary Midgley's concern is that Richard Dawkins' account of ''The Selfish Gene'' serves as a moral and ideological justification for selfishness to be adopted by modern human societies as simply following "nature", providing an excuse for behavior with bad consequences for future human society.  Dawkins' major concluding theme, that humanity is finally gaining power over the "selfish replicators" by virtue of their intelligence, is criticized also by [[primatologist]] [[Frans de Waal]], who refers to it as an example of a "[[veneer theory]]" (the idea that morality is not fundamental, but is laid over a brutal foundation).<ref name=deWaal> {{cite book |author=Frans de Waal |title=Primates and Philosophers: How morality evolved |quote=Dawkins waited until the very last sentence of ''The Selfish Gene'' to reassure us that, in fact, we are welcome to chuck all those genes out the window: "We alone on earth can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish gene replicators." |isbn=9781400830336 |year=2009 |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PccMuO2pcOcC&pg=PA9 |page=9}} </ref> Dawkins claims he merely describes how things are under evolution, and makes no moral arguments.{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006|pp=2–3}}<ref name=DawkinsMoral>An extended disclaimer is found in {{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene  |chapter=Endnotes for p.2: ''I am not advocating a morality based upon evolution'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ICKantUfvoC&pg=PA267 |pages=267–268 |edition=30th Anniversary |isbn=978-0199291144 |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Richard Dawkins}}  </ref> On BBC-2 TV, Dawkins pointed to evidence for a [[Tit for tat|"Tit-for-Tat" strategy]] (shown to be successful in game theory<ref name=Dugatkin2/>) as the most common, simple, and profitable choice.<ref>Hackett, Dennis (1986).

It also added a second preface by the author, but the original foreword by Trivers was dropped. ===30th anniversary===  In 2006, a 30th anniversary edition{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006}} was published which reinstated the Trivers foreword and contained a new introduction by the author (alongside the previous two prefaces), with some selected extracts from reviews at the back. It was accompanied by a ''[[festschrift]]'' entitled ''[[Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think]]''. In March 2006, a special event entitled [http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/selfish06/selfish06_index.html ''The Selfish Gene'': Thirty Years On] was held at the [[London School of Economics]]. The event was organised by [[Helena Cronin]], and chaired by [[Melvyn Bragg]].
