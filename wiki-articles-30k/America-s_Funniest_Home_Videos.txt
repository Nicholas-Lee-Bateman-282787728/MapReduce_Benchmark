    America's Funniest Home Videos (often simply abbreviated to AFHV or its on-air abbreviation AFV) is an American reality television program on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), which features humorous homemade videos that are submitted by viewers. The most common videos feature unintentional physical comedy (arising from incidents, accidents, and mishaps), pets or children, and some staged practical jokes. Originally airing as a special on November 26, 1989, it debuted as a regular weekly series on January 14, 1990. Initially, it was hosted by Bob Saget for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation, then by John Fugelsang and Daisy Fuentes for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as D.L. Hughley and Richard Kind, ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in the summer of 2001 with new host Tom Bergeron, who has since become the series' longest-serving host. Before the show was renewed for a 25th season, Bergeron announced in March 2014 that he would be departing as host of the show after that season concluded. On May 7, 2015, ABC renewed the series for a 26th season; and Alfonso Ribeiro took over as host beginning with that season. Executive produced by Vin Di Bona, Todd Thicke and Michele Nasraway, it is the longest-running primetime entertainment program on ABC (both on the network's current schedule and dating back to ABC's incorporation as a television network in 1948). It is based on the Tokyo Broadcasting System program Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan, which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in video clips from their home movies; ABC, which owns half of the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format.Littleton, Cynthia.

A more similar concept in that a whole 30-to-45-minute show consisted of nothing but short clips from amateur home videos with slapstick-like accidents presented by a host began broadcasting only two months after the start of Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan in Japan, under the title  (lit., "Crashes, bad luck, and slip ups") in Germany in March 1986, that program lasted until 2003. Contestants can either send their videos in by uploading them onto the show's official website, AFV.com, which launched in 2012. From 2008 to 2012, viewers were able to upload their videos to ABC's website, ABC.com; after the separate website for the program went online, users trying to access the America's Funniest Home Videos page on ABC's website – via the show page link on the site's program menu – are now automatically redirected to AFV.com and forwarded to the clip uploading process on that site. Videos can also be sent via conventional mail on VHS, and later as the format started to become common for home recording use in the early 2000s, DVD to a Hollywood, California post-office box address. Due to its very low cost and universal appeal, the format has since been reproduced around the world and AFV-inspired television specials and series continue to emerge periodically in the United States. American television series inspired by AFVs format that are not related to the series itself include The Planet's Funniest Animals, The World's Funniest!, The World's Funniest Moments, Funniest Pets & People and It Only Hurts When I Laugh; however, most of the series inspired by AFV (with the minor exception of The Planet's Funniest Animals) have not matched the success of America's Funniest Home Videos and have not lasted as long. Several local television stations, even those not affiliated with ABC, also developed special funny home video segments in their newscasts during the early 1990s, inspired by the series.Scott Williams. "Local TV getting into 'Funniest Videos' act", Chicago Sun-Times, April 26, 1990. Retrieved March 8, 2011 from HighBeam Research. The majority of the video clips are short (5–30 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos typically feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past U.S. Presidents), and practical jokes. A group of screeners view the submitted tapes, giving them a grade (on a scale of 1–10) based on that particular tape's humor. The videos deemed the funniest by the screeners then go on to the show's producers and then is turned over to Di Bona and another producer for final approval.Susan Bickelhaupt, Globe Staff.

Every week, three of the videos seen (which are among those included in the episode) are chosen by the producers and voted on by the studio audience. The winner wins $10,000 and is in the running for the $100,000 prize at the end of a seven- or ten-show run, while the runner-up receives $3,000 and the third place video receives $2,000. Very early in the show's run, the second and third prizes respectively were a new TV set and VCR and a new camcorder. On the initial hour-long special, the grand prize was $5,000 with second and third places winning a new camcorder; the producer picked the winner, with no audience voting. Periodically beginning with the Tom Bergeron run of the series, the grand prize winner at each season's final $100,000 contest will also win a free vacation package, supplied by either Adventures by Disney or Disney Vacation Club, in addition to the monetary prize. The program's studio segments are taped in front of a studio audience (although the specials that aired in 1999 and 2000 only featured pre-recorded audience responses); audience members are asked to dress in "business casual or nicer". Show creator Vin Di Bona has produced two similar programs: America's Funniest People (1990–94) and World's Funniest Videos (1996). Di Bona also created two series featuring home videos that were largely culled from those seen on AFHV and America's Funniest People: the syndicated series That's Funny (2004–06)Dempsey, John. "Di Bona's 'Funny' will get gags gig", Daily Variety, January 23, 2004. Retrieved March 7, 2011 from HighBeam Research. and the Fox Family Channel series Show Me The Funny (1998–2000). Many of the clips have been used internationally in various comedy compilation programs, with changes such as dubbing and subtitling. The title of the show is usually changed and the studio segments are omitted. As noted in the closing credits of each episode, most of the videos have been edited for length due to time constraints. In addition, according to the contest plugs, family members (both immediate or relatives) of employees of Vin Di Bona Productions, ABC, Inc., its corporate parent The Walt Disney Company and their related subsidiaries are ineligible for the show's contests and prizes. On October 3, 2010, beginning with the season 21 premiere, America's Funniest Home Videos began broadcasting in high definition. Many of the videos, which are largely shot using standard definition camcorders, began to be stretched horizontally to fit 16:9 screens. However, since the 2012–13 season, videos shot in 4:3 standard definition began to be pillarboxed (particularly videos that are recorded on mobile devices that are shot at a vertical angle that would not even fit the 4:3 safe area of many television sets entirely; since the conversion to HD, the series has featured advisories to viewers to tilt their mobile devices horizontally to when recording in order for their videos to fit 16:9 screens). The show debuted on November 26, 1989 as an hour-long special, produced by Vin Di Bona and Steve Paskay, with actor/comedian Bob Saget (then starring in the ABC sitcom Full House) as its host. Saget was assisted in hosting the special by actress Kellie Martin, then the star of fellow ABC series Life Goes On, a family drama which would serve as the lead-in program to AFHV for the latter show's first four seasons. Prior to the airing of the initial special, in the fall of 1989, Vin Di Bona Productions took out ads in national magazines (such as TV Guide) asking people to send in their home videos featuring funny or amazing moments.Richard Roeper.

Originally intended as a one-off special, it became an unexpected hit, causing ABC to place an episode order for the show turning it into a regular weekly half-hour primetime series; it made its debut as a series on January 14, 1990.Patricia Brennan.

Charlie O'Donnell (who notably served as the longtime announcer of Wheel of Fortune until his death in 2010) served as announcer for a few episodes during the first season. Besides hosting the series, Saget also served as a member of its writing staff, alongside Todd Thicke and Bob Arnott. The success of AFHV led to a spinoff called America's Funniest People, hosted by Saget's Full House co-star Dave Coulier (and co-hosted by actress/producer Arleen Sorkin for the first two seasons, then model Tawny Kitaen for the final two), focusing on videos featuring people doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.Ernest Tucker.

Saget always ended each episode with the phrase "Keep those cameras safely rolling", and saying something to his wife who was (implied to be) watching the show. Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the "Assignment America" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced in the Saget era called "Backwards Classics," shows videos being played in reverse. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called "Music Montage"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named "Stretchy McGillicuddy" (voiced by Danny Mann), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: "Don't get a little touchy Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled America's Funniest People after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with the Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern slot that was now left vacant.

For Saget's final season on AFHV, two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set during this era basically consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design, was remodeled for the 1992–93 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls – though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching America's Funniest Home Videos. This technique was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor, and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character, and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997, and he decided to leave the show afterward."News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host", Los Angeles Daily News, August 2, 1997.

This segment continued to appear occasionally until the fourth year of Tom Bergeron's stint as host. Another notable segment was the "AFV Hall of Fame", in which a clip is shown, and Fugelsang reveals the moment of impact (a screen that shows a still picture of that clip) that occurred in it. This segment was scrapped at the end of season ten. Another featured segment was "Who Would You Like to See...", in which a random person is asked which celebrity they would like to see involved in a random humorous mishap, with a photo of a celebrity's face posterized over the face of the actual person in the video.

By this point, the show was expanded to full hour-long episodes, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes. The show was now being seen on Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the September 11 attacks and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup. That lineup was short-lived, and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the AFV specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. The Bergeron version added new segments, such as "Tom's Home Movies", where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including "Head, Gut, or Groin," where Tom picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an America's Funniest Home Videos compilation DVD (since the 2012–13 season, a bobblehead of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the "slo-mo gizmo", where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and telestrated. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase "If you get it on (video)tape, you could get it in cash", which was later changed to "Upload to us. Get rich, get famous" by the 2008–09 season. Other segments introduced in the Bergeron era included Starting with the 2007–08 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012–13 season; launched their own website that same year in 2013 and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail.

In the final six seasons of Tom Bergeron's run as host, the show started its "Funny Since 1989" campaign in 2009 and had two anniversary seasons. Season 20, in 2009, had a special 20th anniversary episode that aired on November 29, 2009. The special brought back Bob Saget to AFV for the first time in 12 years as a guest.

Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the season 20 finale of Dancing with the Stars (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the prior season). Alfonso was also a guest contestant on a season 25 episode of AFV playing one of the show's games with then-host Tom Bergeron called "Who's Makin' That Racket?".

The first theme was "The Funny Things You Do", composed by Dan Slider and performed by Jill Colucci, who also wrote the lyrics with Stewart Harris. This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first eight-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when Tom Bergeron introduced Saget as well as a montage of classic videos and Bob Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Bob Saget's run (during AFV's first eight seasons) on the show  in the AFV 20th anniversary special, which aired on November 29, 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled AFV XD is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the Saget era.AFV XD - YouTube During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Starting on January 5, 1997 during Bob Saget's final season, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for America's Funniest People) and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When AFHV returned for its ninth season with new hosts Daisy Fuentes and John Fugelsang, a completely new arrangement of "The Funny Things You Do" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Dan Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key (of the 1989–96 version) restored, making it sound similar to "The Impression That I Get" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones (and to a lesser extent, "Livin' la Vida Loca" by Ricky Martin). An alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002–03 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002–03 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on WGN America and the Tom Bergeron episodes on WGN America and ABC Family, the theme is noticeably slowed down (albeit slightly) during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. The 1998 theme can be heard in its entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The two themes used in the Saget era have not been released to this day, as they are reportedly being held by Vin Di Bona for unknown reasons. For season 26, with new host Alfonso Ribiero, a new arrangement of "The Funny Things You Do" was introduced with that season's premiere episode on October 11, 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after 17 seasons. The current theme (which Slider also composed) is stylized more alike the 1989–96 version with the original key of that theme as well as the additional hook of the 1998–2014 version retained. "The Funny Things You Do" was the theme song to the Australian version between 1991 and 2004. "The Funny Things You Do" was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005. All episodes of AFHV are in syndication, although for unknown reasons, the 1989–97 Saget episodes, the 1998–99 Fugelsang/Fuentes episodes, and the 2001-15 Tom Bergeron episodes have virtually never been aired together in off-network broadcast or cable syndication; instead each era of the series has aired separately—except for the 1994–97 Saget episodes, the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes and the 2009-15 Bergeron episodes, which have never been aired in broadcast syndication. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by 20th Television, which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of MTM Enterprises, which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.McClellan, Steve.

Currently, Disney-ABC Domestic Television (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies ABC Productions, distributes all versions of the series. Currently, AFV airs the entire Tom Bergeron-run on WGN America, CMT, TV Land, and TBS. The 1989–94 Bob Saget episodes started airing in off-network syndication in September 1995, and also aired on TBS from October 2, 1995 to September 1998; USA Network from 1998 to 2001; the Hallmark Channel from August 5, 2001 to 2003 and January 4 to February 25, 2010; Pax TV (now Ion Television) on Monday through Thursday nights (Fridays were later added) from 2003 to 2005; and Nick at Nite from April to October 2007. The 1998–99 Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes aired on ABC Family from the fall of 1999 (known as Fox Family and owned by News Corporation at the time), until the fall of 2003; the 1994–97 Saget episodes also aired on the network from the fall of 2003 to September 2007, usually on Monday through Saturday nights, and occasionally Sundays if a movie ended before 11 p.m. ET. The Tom Bergeron episodes aired on ABC Family on October 1, 2007 to September 2013; it usually aired three to six nights a week with episodes regularly airing at 6 p.m. ET (depending upon the night's schedule); it had previously also ran on the network in a four-hour block on Fridays from 6 to 11 p.m. ET from 2009 to 2012. The Tom Bergeron (and until Fall 2014, Fuentes-Fugelsang) episodes have aired on WGN America since 2004. Currently, the channel mostly shows the 2001-09 Tom Bergeron run (now in reworked form for HD broadcasts as of Fall 2014), which airs Mondays and on select days in 4-hour blocks from 6 to 10 p.m. ET. Before the primetime newscast was dropped by WGN America in February 2014, the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes aired on occasions until Fall 2014 (more frequently from 2004 to 2010, due to primetime movie overruns) when a sporting event airing on WGN-TV/Chicago that was not cleared to air on WGN America forced the preemption of its simulcast of WGN-TV's 9 p.m. newscast outside of Chicago. Atlanta independent station WPCH-TV (channel 17; formerly the local Atlanta feed of TBS, now known as "PeachtreeTV") aired the entire Saget run, the first (and so far, the only) channel ever to do so since the original ABC run, from 2007 to 2009. The Tom Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; WGN America also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011, while alternate versions of the Bergeron (and sometimes the Fugelsang-Fuentes) episodes with the Buena Vista Television tag before the end credits aired in the evening. Months ahead of and in preparation for AFV's 25th anniversary and Tom Bergeron's 15th and final season as host of AFV in season 25, as of August 2014, the 2001-09 (and season 20) Tom Bergeron episodes from past seasons for its syndication rerun airings were reworked to make them more HD friendly and rid the episodes of "some" of their outdated promo, contest sweepstakes, and sponsorship references that may no longer be valid. Evidence of the reworks can be seen when the picture zooms back to its original standard-definition format during the end credits (on WGN America and the season 20 package on TBS only) with the colored bars utilizing the show's different background color schemes from past seasons on the left and right sides of screens. The 2009–15 Tom Bergeron episodes (with a reworked season 20 package) began airing for the first time ever in syndication (on TBS) on September 15, 2014. The season 21-25 episodes currently airing in syndication (on TBS) remain in their original, unaltered ABC network-aired form with the outdated promo spots. Like the initial ABC airings, while the syndicated episodes continue to use all of the different color and logo variations of the ABC Entertainment and Vin Di Bona Productions tags before or after the end credits, depending on the station or cable networks, they do not show the Buena Vista Television or even the ABC Studios or Disney/ABC Domestic Television distribution tags as of Fall 2014. Outside the United States, family-oriented Canadian cable channel YTV has aired AFV on Saturday nights since September 2009. Canadian broadcaster yesTV, with CHEK-DT in British Columbia, also began airing a simulcast of AFV episodes on Sundays at 7 p.m. local time, as it airs on ABC in the United States (but factoring simultaneous substitution), starting from the 25th season, City and its sister network OMNI was the previous broadcaster in Canada since the Spring of 2010. ABC Spark, a channel that borrows original programming and some syndicated programs from ABC Family in the U.S., began carrying the series upon the channel's March 2012 launch. In Pax airings of the Bob Saget run, when back-to-back episodes aired, the opening titles of the second episode was cut and replaced with an announcer saying "Now don't go away, here's more of America's Funniest Home Videos!" before cutting to Ernie Anderson introducing Saget. Some airings of the Saget version on Pax-TV, Hallmark, and Nick at Nite cut the interviews with the winners, due to time constraints, because of the longer ad breaks that were not seen on U.S. broadcast television during the period that the episodes originally aired on ABC. Also, because of time constraints, some Hallmark episodes have the opening titles (as well as various portions of the show) sped up. Broadcast syndication airings of the Bergeron-era episodes have censored instances of nudity involving young children, which were uncensored in the original ABC broadcasts. ABC, Shout! Factory, and Slingshot Entertainment have released numerous compilation releases of America's Funniest Home Videos on VHS and DVD in Region 1 (North America).
