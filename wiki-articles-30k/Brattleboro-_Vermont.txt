   Brattleboro (, originally Brattleborough, is a town in Windham County, Vermont, United States, located in the southeast corner of the state, along the state line with New Hampshire. The population is 11,765, according to the US Census Bureau's 2014 estimates. It is the most populous municipality along Vermont's eastern border, the fourth largest town in the state (trailing Essex, Colchester, and Bennington), and the seventh largest municipality in Vermont overall when the cities of Burlington, South Burlington and Rutland are included. Brattleboro is situated on the west bank of the Connecticut River at the point where Vermont's West River flows into it. Noted for its vibrant and diverse arts community, the town is also home to the Brattleboro Retreat (a mental health and addictions hospital), two graduate schools; Marlboro College Center for Graduate and Professional Studies, and the SIT Graduate Institute (an international educational institution), plus satellite campuses of three colleges; the Community College of Vermont, Vermont Technical College, and Union Institute and University. It is also home to New England Center for Circus Arts. Because Native Americans in the region tended to name places and regions after their rivers or watersheds, the site of today's Brattleboro, the confluence of the West River and the Connecticut River, was called 'Wantastiquet'DeLorme (1996). Vermont Atlas & Gazetteer. Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. ISBN 0-89933-016-9. by the Abenaki people, a name meaning, according to various translations, "lost river", "river that leads to the west", or "river of the lonely way". Today known only by its English-transliterated name, the West River remains demarcated by New Hampshire's towering Mount Wantastiquet, directly opposite its mouth, and Lake Wantastiquet, near where it rises at its source. The Abenaki would transit this area annually between Missisquoi (their summer hunting grounds near the current-day town of Swanton) in northwestern Vermont, and Squakheag (their winter settlement or camps) near what is now Northfield, Massachusetts. The specific Abenaki band who lived here and traversed this place were called Sokoki, meaning "people who go their own way" or "people of the lonely way".  The Abenaki's inclusive name for what is now Vermont was "Ndakinna" ("our land"), and in the 17th and 18th centuries, as more Europeans moved into the region, their often vigorous measures of self-defense culminated in Dummer's War (also known variously as Greylock's War, Three Years War, Lovewell's War, the 4th Indian War, and in Maine as Father Rasle's War). Most Abenaki allied with the French during this period, and following what is now known as the French and Indian War (1754–1763), they were largely driven north or fled into Quebec, further opening the way for English – and later United States – settlements in the area. To defend the Massachusetts Bay Colony against Chief Gray Lock and others during Dummer's War, the Massachusetts General Court voted on December 27, 1723 to build a blockhouse and stockade on the Connecticut River near the site of what would later become known as Brattleboro. Lieutenant-governor William Dummer signed the measure, and construction of Fort Dummer began on February 3, 1724. It was completed before summer. On October 11 of that year, the French attacked the fort and killed some soldiers.A. J. Coolidge & J. B. Mansfield, '&#39;A History and Description of New England;'&#39; Boston, Massachusetts 1859. Books.google.com. In 1725, Dummer's War ended. By 1728, and in subsequent peaceful periods, the fort served as a trading post for commerce among the colonial settlers and the Indians. But violence flared up from time to time throughout the first half of the 18th century. In 1744, what became known as King George's War broke out, lasting until 1748. During this period a small body of British colonial troops were posted at the fort, but after 1750 this was considered unnecessary. Although the area was originally part of the Equivalent Lands, the township became one of the New Hampshire grants, and was chartered (founded) as such on December 26, 1753, by Governor Benning Wentworth. It was named Brattleborough, after Colonel William Brattle, Jr. of Boston, a principal proprietor. Still, settlement activities remained tentative until after the 1763 Treaty of Paris, when France abandoned their claims to Vermont, part of the region which they had called New France. Hostilities having ceased, Brattleboro developed quickly in peacetime, and soon was second to none in the state for business and wealth. In 1771, Stephen Greenleaf opened Vermont's first store in the east village, and in 1784, a post office was established. A bridge was built across the Connecticut River to Hinsdale, New Hampshire in 1804.Brattleboro in 1824. Web.archive.org (October 27, 2009). In 1834, the Brattleboro Retreat, then called the Vermont Asylum for the Insane,http://www.usgennet.org/usa/vt/county/windham/asylumwebpage.htm was founded by the generous bequest of Hinsdale, NH's Anna Marsh. In 1844 the Brattleboro Hydropathic Establishment was opened by Dr. Robert Wesselhoeft; this was the third 'water cure' establishment in the country, utilizing waters from a spring near the current downtown fire station. Until the "Water Cure" closed in 1871, the town was widely known as a curative health resort. Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org).

By 1859, when the population had reached 3,816, Brattleboro had a woolen textile mill, a paper mill, a manufacturer of papermaking machinery, a factory making [[Melodeon (organ)|melodeon]]s, two machine shops, a flour mill, a carriage factory, and four printing establishments.<ref name="books.google.com" /> Connected by the [[Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad|Vermont & Massachusetts Railroad]] and the [[Vermont Valley Railroad]], the town prospered as a regional center for trade in commodities including grain, lumber, [[turpentine]], [[tallow]] and pork.<ref>[http://newenglandtowns.org/vermont/brattleborough Hayward's '&#39;New England Gazetteer of 1839'&#39;].

Kipling also wrote about local life in the early 1890s: heavy snowfalls, ox-teams drawing sledges, and people in the small towns beset with what he called a "terrifying intimacy" about each other's lives. He recorded the dearth of men who had left, going to seek their fortunes in the cities or out west, and the consequent loneliness and depression in the lives of local women; the long length of the workday for farmers, even in winter, often for lack of help; and the abandonment of farms.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12089 Letters of Travel 1892-1913]</ref>  The first person ever to receive a [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefit check, issued on January 31, 1940 was [[Ida May Fuller]] from Brattleboro.<ref>Her check number was 00-000-001 and it was for $22.54; {{cite web | author =Social Security Online | url =http://www.ssa.gov/history/imf.html | title =The First Social Security Beneficiary | publisher =Social Security Administration | accessdate =June 28, 2007}}</ref>  ==Geography== Brattleboro is situated at {{Coord|42|51|15|N|72|33|31|W|}}. Due to its location in the southernmost part of Vermont, the town is actually geographically closer to the other regional state capitals of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], and [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] than it is to its own state capital of [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]].  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 32.5&nbsp;square miles (84.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which 32.0&nbsp;square miles (82.9&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 0.5&nbsp;square mile (1.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 1.42%) is water. Brattleboro is drained by the [[West River (Vermont)|West River]], Ames Hill Brook and Whetstone Brook. The town is in the [[Connecticut River Valley]], and its eastern boundary (and the Vermont state line) is the western bank of the [[Connecticut River]]. Hills and mountains surround the town.  ==Economy== Both a commercial and touristic gateway for the state of Vermont, Brattleboro is the first major town one encounters crossing northward by automobile from Massachusetts on [[Interstate 91]], and is accessed via Vermont exits 1, 2, and 3 from that thoroughfare. It offers a mix of a rural atmosphere and urban amenities, including a large number of lodging establishments. Brattleboro also hosts many art galleries, stores, and performance spaces, most of them located in the downtown area.  In 2007, after meeting certain qualifying criteria, Brattleboro's Selectboard passed a resolution designating itself a Fair Trade Town, becoming the second [[Fairtrade certification|Fair Trade certified]] town in the nation after [[Media, Pennsylvania]].<ref>[http://fairtradecampaigns.org/about/ About], Fair Trade Campaigns USA.

Because of the surrounding steep hills there is very little flat land, and many of its buildings and houses are situated on steep hillsides, necessarily closely bunched together. This concentrated topography and population density have helped to create a semi-urban, cosmopolitan atmosphere in the downtown.  Since the 1950s, additional construction and development have expanded outside the concentrated downtown area; in the west, south, and north of the township. The southeast quarter of the town, near to and abutting the riverbank, is where its population has historically been the densest, and is composed largely of one- or two-family houses, with apartment buildings such as "[[triple deckers]]" interspersed among them. Commercial and industrial operations are concentrated on the [[U.S. Route 5|Canal Street]] artery that cuts through the area. The town's high school and the Regional Career Center are also located in this section, as is Fort Dummer State Park, which is named after the first European settlers' 1724 stockade. The original Fort's site, however, was flooded in the early 20th century by a flood-control and hydro-electric dam built just downstream in Vernon, VT. An historical marker is near the Fort's now-underwater site near the west bank of the Connecticut River; the plaque is located on Vernon Road (VT Route 142) at the corner of Cotton Mill Hill.  The western section of town, built up around VT's east-west [[VT Route 9|Route 9]], was formally designated a village in 2005. It is mostly lower-density residential in character, and features the state's largest mobile home park and several planned housing developments and subdivisions. Away from the Route 9 conduit, other parts of western Brattleboro and some areas north of the West River have a decidedly rural character, with dirt roads, sparse housing, wooded [[Green Mountains]] foothills, and the last few farms left in the town following the 1970s' decline of the dairy industry. At its peak, the immediate Brattleboro area had over 170 farms; there are now less than a dozen remaining.  The section of Brattleboro north of the [[West River (Vermont)|West River]], formerly farmland, was mostly subdivided and developed during the 1960s and 1970s following the construction of Interstate 91, which runs north-south through the town. The area has little residential development and is dominated by larger commercial and industrial establishments and suburban-style shopping areas along [[US Route 5|Putney Road]], including seven chain hotels and motels located within a short distance of each other.  Brattleboro is also the headquarters of the [[Holstein (cattle)|Holstein/Friesian Cattle]] Association, which houses and maintains the worldwide registry for the breed.{{clear left}}   [[Image:Bird's-eye View of Brattleboro, VT.jpg|thumb|center|600px|A 'bird's-eye' view of Brattleboro, looking westward from near the summit of New Hampshire's Mount Wantastiquet, taken in 1905.

The town can experience snowfall as early as November and as late as April, and in the adjacent mountains and high country as late as May. Nor'easters often come with the potential of dumping a foot or more of snow on Brattleboro when they move through; such storms are not uncommon during the winter months. Summers are warm to hot and generally humid, with abundant sunshine and heavy showers and [[thunderstorms]] associated with passing [[cold front]]s. [[Tornado]]es are rare.  The record high is {{convert|100|F|C|0}}, set in 1955, and the record low is {{convert|-33|F|C|0}}, set in 1958. In terms of average annual [[precipitation]], May is typically the wettest month, and February is the driest.

Almost all of the population is concentrated in two [[census-designated place]]s identified in the town: [[Brattleboro (CDP), Vermont|Brattleboro]] and [[West Brattleboro]]. The results of the 2010 census indicate very little change in the overall number of people living in the Town. Despite this, Brattleboro remains the most populous town along Vermont's eastern border.  The [[population density]] of the town was 375.3 people per square mile (144.9/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 5,686 housing units at an average density of 177.7 per square mile (68.6/km<sup>2</sup>).

The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females there were 84.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 79.9 males.  The median income for a household in the town was $31,997, and the median income for a family was $44,267. Males had a median income of $31,001 versus $25,329 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $19,554. About 9.2% of families and 13.1% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 18.0% of those under age 18 and 9.2% of those age 65 or over.  ==Government== Brattleboro employs a [[Representative Town Meeting]] local government, wherein its citizens are represented at-large by a Select Board of five members, and by several dozen Town Representatives elected from three municipal districts. The Select Board, meeting on average every week or two, is considered part of the 'executive branch' of town government; its five members being elected to fill three one-year positions and two three-year positions.

From this point, it runs for about 12 miles on a very gently graded roadbed along the West River's southern bank, affording a stunning vista and connecting Brattleboro with picturesque New England towns and recreational areas elsewhere in Windham County and Vermont, its wide riverside paved shoulder making it a favorite with cyclists.
