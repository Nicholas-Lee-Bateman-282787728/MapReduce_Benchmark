   Mary Baker Eddy (July 16, 1821 – December 3, 1910) was the founder of Christian Science, a new religious movement, in the United States in the latter half of the 19th century. Eddy wrote the movement's textbook, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (first published 1875), and in 1879 founded the Church of Christ, Scientist. She also founded the Christian Science Publishing Society (1898), which continues to publish a number of periodicals, including The Christian Science Monitor (founded in 1908).  Eddy was born Mary Morse Baker in a farmhouse in Bow, New Hampshire, to a farmer, Mark Baker (d.&nbsp;1865), and his wife, Abigail Barnard Baker, née Ambrose (d.&nbsp;1849). Eddy was the youngest of the Bakers' six children. There were three boys, Samuel Dow (1808), Albert (1810) and George Sullivan (1812), followed by three girls, Abigail Barnard (1816), Martha Smith (1819) and Mary Morse, two years later.Ernest Sutherland Bates and John V. Dittemore, Mary Baker Eddy: The Truth and the Tradition, A. A. Knopf, 1932, 3. Mark Baker was a strongly religious man from a Protestant Congregationalist background, a firm believer in the final judgment and eternal damnation, according to Eddy.Mary Baker Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, Christian Science Publishing Society, 1891, 13. McClure's magazine wrote in 1907, in a series of articles that were highly critical of Eddy, that Baker's home library consisted of the Bible, though Eddy responded that this was untrue and that her father had been an avid reader.Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine, "Mary Baker G. Eddy: The Story of Her Life and the History of Christian Science", McClure's, January 1907, 232. Mary Baker Eddy, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany, Christian Science Publishing Society, 1913, 308; Mary Baker Eddy, "Reply to McClure's Magazine", Christian Science Endtime Center, undated. Eddy wrote that her father had been a justice of the peace at one point and a chaplain of the New Hampshire State Militia.Eddy, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany, 309. He developed a reputation locally for being disputatious; one neighbor described him as "[a] tiger for a temper and always in a row."Bates and Dittemore 1932, 4–5. McClure's reported several similar stories from neighbors, including that he once killed a crow with his walking stick for violating the Sabbath.Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 232. The magazine described him as a supporter of slavery and alleged that he had been pleased to hear about Abraham Lincoln's death.Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 229. Eddy responded that Baker had been a "strong believer in States’ rights, but slavery he regarded as a great sin." As well as inheriting their father's temper, according to McClure's, the Baker children also inherited his good looks, and Eddy became known as the village beauty. Life was nevertheless spartan and repetitive. Every day began with lengthy prayer and continued with hard work. The only rest day was the Sabbath.Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 230, 234.  Eddy and her father reportedly had a volatile relationship. Ernest Sutherland Bates and John V. Dittemore wrote in 1932 that Baker sought to break Eddy's will with harsh punishment, although her mother often intervened; in contrast to Mark Baker, Eddy's mother was described as devout, quiet, light-hearted and kind.Bates and Dittemore 1932, 7. Eddy experienced periods of sudden illness, perhaps in an effort to control her father's attitude toward her.Caroline Fraser, God's Perfect Child, Metropolitan Books, 1999, 35. Those who knew the family described her as suddenly falling to the floor, writhing and screaming, or silent and apparently unconsciousness, sometimes for hours.Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 236; Bates and Dittemore 1932, 7. Robert Peel, one of Eddy's biographers, who worked for the Christian Science church, wrote in 1966: Gillian Gill wrote in 1998 that, although Eddy was often sick as a child and appears to have suffered from an eating disorder, reports of hysterical fits may have been exaggerated.Gillian Gill, Mary Baker Eddy, De Capo Press, 1998, 39–47. Eddy described her problems with food in the first edition of Science and Health (1875). She wrote that she had suffered from chronic indigestion as a child and, hoping to cure it, had embarked on a diet of nothing but water, bread and vegetables, at one point consumed just once a day: "Thus we passed most of our early years, as many can attest, in hunger, pain, weakness, and starvation."Mary Baker Eddy, Science and Health, 1st edition, Christian Science Publishing Company, 1875, 189–190. She also wrote, in her autobiography, Retrospection and Introspection (1891), that when she was eight she heard a voice call her name, which she interpreted as a religious experience. "For some twelve months, when I was about eight years old, I repeatedly heard a voice, calling me distinctly by name, three times, in an ascending scale."Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 8–9.   In 1836, when Eddy was fifteen, the Bakers moved twenty miles to Sanbornton Bridge, New Hampshire, known after 1869 as Tilton.Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 235. As a youngster she was often tutored by Albert, a brilliant young man in his own right who as a lawyer clerked for Franklin Pierce and then later became a Congressman himself before his untimely death. Another tutor, Mary's spiritual guide as well, the Reverend Enoch Corser, told his son Bartlett, concerning Mary, "I never before had a pupil with such depth and independence of thought.  She has some great future, mark that  She is an intellectual and spiritual genius." "Bright, good, and pure, aye brilliant!" Joseph S. Robinson in his book Waymarks in the Life of Mary Baker Eddy, writes of Mary Baker Eddy's education, "Mary Baker Eddy completed her education at the Holmes Academy in Plymouth and Sanbornton Academy at the Bridge, between the years 1838 and 1842, when the present Tilton School served as a female college. In Professor Dyer Hook Sanborn she had an instructor of more than average talents. He was the author of a treatise on normal school teaching, and his "Analytical Grammar" went through eight editions. He was also the town's "superintending school committee" and in 1845 he became Representative. His was a "celebrated school," Lucy Cross, historian of Northfield, states for he was a "model educator," turning out "many finely educated lady teachers." Mary Baker Eddy served as a substitute instructor at the same institution after its name had changed to the "New Hampshire Conference Seminary and Female College." Bates and Dittemore write that Eddy was not able to attend Sanbornton Academy when the family first moved there, but was required instead to start at the district school (in the same building) with the youngest girls. She withdrew after a month because of poor health, then received private tuition from the Reverend Enoch Corser.  She entered Sanbornton Academy in 1842.Bates and Dittemore 1932, 16–17, 25. She was received into the Congregational church in Tilton on 26 July 1838 when she was 17, according to church records published by McClure's in 1907. Eddy had written in her autobiography in 1891 that she was 12 when this happened, and that she had discussed the idea of predestination with the pastor during the examination for her membership; this may have been an attempt to reflect the story of a 12-year-old Jesus in the Temple.Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 14–15; Cather and Milmine, McClure's, January 1907, 237. She wrote in response to the McClure's article that the date of her church membership may have been mistaken.Eddy, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany, 311: "My reply to the statement that the clerk's book shows that I joined the Tilton Congregational Church at the age of seventeen is that my religious experience seemed to culminate at twelve years of age. Hence a mistake may have occurred as to the exact date of my first church membership." Eddy objected so strongly to the idea of predestination and eternal damnation that it made her ill:  Eddy was badly affected by four deaths in the 1840s.Stephen Gottschalk, Rolling Away the Stone, Indiana University Press, 2006, 62–64. Her brother Albert, someone she regarded as a teacher and mentor, died in 1841. In 1844 her first husband, George Washington Glover, a friend of her brother Samuel's, died after six months of marriage. They had married in December 1843, and set up home in Charleston, South Carolina, where Glover had business, but in June 1844 he died of yellow fever during a business trip to Wilmington, North Carolina. Eddy was with him in Wilmington, six months pregnant. She had to make her way back to New Hampshire, 1,400 miles by train and steamboat, where her only child, George Washington II, was born on 12 September in her father's home.Gottschalk 2006, 62–63; Gill 1998, xxix, 68–69 Her husband's death, the journey back, and the birth left her physically and mentally exhausted, and she ended up bedridden for months.Gottschalk 2006, 63. She briefly tried to earn a living by writing articles for the New Hampshire Patriot. She also worked as a substitute teacher in the New Hampshire Conference Seminary, and in 1846 ran her own kindergarten for a few months, apparently refusing to use corporal punishment.Gill 1998, 74–75. Then, in November 1849, her mother died. Eddy wrote to one of her brothers: "What is left of earth to me!" Her mother's death was followed, three weeks later, by the death of her fiance, John Bartlett, a lawyer.Gottschalk 2006, 64. In 1850, Eddy wrote, her son was sent away to be looked after by the family's nurse; he was by then four years old.Eddy Retrospection and Introspection, 20. Sources differ as to whether Eddy could have prevented this.Fraser 1999, 38. It was difficult for a woman in her circumstances to earn money, and according to the legal doctrine of coverture, women in the United States during this period could not be their own children's guardians. When their husbands died, they were left in a legally vulnerable position."Women and the Law", Women, Enterprise & Society, Harvard Business School, 2010: "A married woman or feme covert was a dependent, like an underage child or a slave, and could not own property in her own name or control her own earnings, except under very specific circumstances. When a husband died, his wife could not be the guardian to their under-age children."  Mark Baker remarried in 1850; his second wife, Elizabeth Patterson Duncan (d. 6 June 1875), had been widowed twice and had some property and income from her second marriage.Gill 1998, 86–87. Baker apparently made clear to Eddy that her son would not be welcome in the new marital home. She wrote: George was sent to stay with various relatives and Eddy decided to live with her sister, Abigail. Abigail apparently also declined to take George, then six years old. Eddy married again in 1853. Her second husband, Daniel Patterson, a dentist, apparently said he would become George's legal guardian, but appears not to have gone ahead with this, and Eddy lost contact with her son until he was in his thirties:  In October 1862 Eddy became a patient of Phineas Quimby,Gill 1998, 131. a magnetic healer from Maine. From 1862 to 1865 Quimby and Eddy engaged in lengthy discussions about healing methods practiced by Quimby and others. The extent to which he influenced her is much debated. Originally, Eddy gave Quimby much credit for his hypnotic treatments of her nervous and physical conditions and initially thought his brand of mesmerism entirely benign.Robert Peel, Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, Chapter 6, Sections I, II. Quimby was steeped both in the Protestant Christianity of his time and the science of the industrial revolution. He wrote in 1864, "The wise man, in like measure&nbsp;... knows that the light of the body or natural man is but the reflection of the scientific man. Our misery lies in this darkness. This is the prison that holds the natural man, till the light of Wisdom bursts his bonds, and lets the captive free. Here is where Christ went to preach to the prisoners bound by error before the reformation of science."Quimby papers, Library of Congress, Vol. 6, 112. In a letter to the Portland Evening Courier in November 1862, Eddy wrote:  In a letter in 1864 she wrote that "I am up and about today, i.e., by the help of the Lord."Lyman Powell, Christian science, the faith and its founder, G.P. Putnam's sons, 1917, 31. In another letter to the Portland Evening Courier, Eddy denied mesmerism, claiming Christ was the cure: While Quimby had his own notions on the nature of these unseen forces, which Eddy accepted early on, she would later draw decidedly different opinions on the nature of thought on the body and reject any form of hypnotism. It is evident that Eddy and Quimby worked together, appreciated one another and learned from one another. Quimby later said he learned more from Eddy than she did from him. Eddy clearly respected him and at one point referred to him as an "advanced thinker" with a "high and noble character."Peel 1971, 172, 183.  However, she later disavowed the hypnotic aspect of Quimby's methods. In Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures she refutes hypnotism, calling it mere deception practiced by those who aim to control the patient. She states "The Christian Scientist demonstrates that divine Mind heals, while the hypnotist dispossesses the patient of his individuality in order to control him.""Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures," by Mary Baker Eddy, p.375 Phineas Quimby died in January 1866. In February 1866, after a fall in Lynn, Massachusetts caused a spinal injury, Eddy said she experienced a healing:  She later filed a claim for money from the city of Lynn for her injury on the grounds that she was "still suffering from the effects of that fall" (though she afterwards withdrew the lawsuit). Gill writes that Eddy's claim was probably made under financial pressure from her husband at the time. Her neighbors believed her sudden recovery to be a near-miracle.Gill 1998, 161-170. Eddy's attending physician Alvin M. Cushing, a homeopath, testified under oath that he "did not at any time declare, or believe, that there was no hope for Mrs. Patterson's recovery, or that she was in critical condition."Martin Gardner, The Healing Revelations of Mary Baker Eddy, Prometheus Books, 1993. She wrote that she devoted the next three years of her life to biblical study and what she considered the discovery of Christian Science. In her autobiography, Retrospection and Introspection, she wrote: "I then withdrew from society about three years,--to ponder my mission, to search the Scriptures, to find the Science of Mind that should take the things of God and show them to the creature, and reveal the great curative Principle, --Deity."Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 8–9, 22, 24–5. Eddy became convinced that illness could be healed through an awakened thought brought about by a clearer perception of God and the explicit rejection of drugs, hygiene and medicine, based on the observation that Jesus did not use these methods for healing: Frank Podmore wrote, after Eddy separated from her second husband, Daniel Patterson, she boarded for four years with several families in Lynn, Amesbury, and elsewhere:  Eddy attempted to distinguish Christian Science from Spiritualism, and wrote in her later publications that she had never been a Spiritualist. According to Robert Peel, in the spring of 1864 Eddy gave a public talk in Warren, Maine, opposing Spiritualism.Peel 1966, 183–84. Hiram Crafts, a student of hers, stated in an affidavit: "At that date I was a Spiritualist, but her teachings changed my views on that subject and I gave up spiritualism."Peel 1966, 212. Reports that Eddy was at one time a medium in Boston surfaced after she became well known.Peel 1966, 133. At the time she was said to be a medium there, she lived some distance away.Gill 1998, 627. She was also bedridden during that time. Peel has been challenged by other researchers who write that Eddy acted as a trance channeler, and worked in and around Boston as a Spiritualist medium giving public séances for money.John Ankerberg, The Facts on the Mind Sciences, Atri Publishing, 2011. According to Gill, Eddy knew spiritualists and took part in some of their activities, but was never a convinced believer.Gill 1998, 179–180. For example, in 1864, she visited a friend, Sarah Crosby, who believed in Spiritualism. Eddy attempted to show Crosby the folly of it by pretending to channel Eddy's brother Albert and writing letters she attributed to him.Sybil Wilbur, "The Story of the Real Mrs. Eddy," Human Life, March 1907, 10. Between 1866 and 1870, Eddy boarded at the home of Brene Paine Clark, who was interested in Spiritualism.Gill 1998, 172. Seances were often conducted there, but Eddy and Clark engaged in vigorous, good-natured arguments about them.Gill 1998, 173. Eddy's arguments against Spiritualism convinced at least one other who was there at the time, Hiram Crafts, that "her science was far superior to spirit teachings."Gill 1998, 174. Clark's son, George, tried to convince Eddy to take up Spiritualism, but he said she abhorred the idea.Peel 1966, 210-211. According to Cather and Milmine, Mrs. Richard Hazeltine, who attended seances at Clark's home,Cather and Milmine, McClure's, May 1907, 108. said Eddy had acted as a trance medium, claiming to channel the spirits of the Apostles.Cather and Milmine 1909, 64–68, 111–116. Eddy was also known for channeling messages from the dead brother of her friend Sarah Crosby. According to Martin Gardner, Eddy's mediumship converted Crosby to Spiritualism.Gardner 1993, 26. Mary Gould, a Spiritualist from Lynn, claimed that one of the spirits that Eddy channeled was Abraham Lincoln. According to eyewitness reports cited by Cather and Milmine, Eddy was still attending séances as late as 1872.Cather and Milmine, 1909. Also see Robert Hall, The Modern Siren, H. L. Thatcher, 1916 (archive.org). In these later séances Eddy would attempt to convert her audience into accepting Christian Science.Todd Leonard, Talking to the Other Side: a History of Modern Spiritualism And Mediumship: A Study of the Religion, Science, Philosophy and Mediums that Encompass this American-Made Religion, iUniverse, Inc., 2005, 32-33 Eddy showed extensive familiarity with Spiritualist practice but denounced it in her Christian Science writings.Christian Science versus Spiritualism  Ann Braude wrote that there were similarities between Spiritualism and Christian Science, but the main difference was that Eddy, after she founded Christian Science, came to believe that spirit manifestations had never really had bodies to begin with, because matter is unreal and that all that really exists is spirit, before and after death.Ann Braude, Radical Spirits: Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America, Indiana University Press, 2001, 186. In 1873 Eddy divorced Daniel Patterson for adultery. In 1875, after several years of offering her healing method, Eddy published her work in a book entitled Science and Health (years later retitled Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures), which she called the textbook of Christian Science. The first publication run was 1,000 copies, which she self-published. During these years she taught what she considered the science of "primitive Christianity" to at least 800 people.Robert Peel, Mary Baker Eddy, The Years of Authority, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1977, 483, n. 104. Many of her students became healers themselves. The last 100 pages of Science and Health (chapter entitled "Fruitage") contains testimonies of people who claimed to have been healed by reading her book. She made numerous revisions to her book from the time of its first publication until shortly before her death.Gill 1998, 324. In 1877 she married Asa Gilbert Eddy; in 1882 they moved to Boston, and he died that year.Mary Baker Eddy Timeline Phineas Quimby by 1859 had connected his healing practices with the Christ of the New Testament. He also called his method of healing the "science of health", the "science of Christ," and had used the term "Christian Science" to describe his work.Walter Martin, The Kingdom of the Cults, Bethany House Publishers, 2003, 151. According to the historian of science James C. Whorton, "In Quimby's mind, Christ and science were synonymous; his method of healing he thus called the Science of Christ and even, toward the close of his life, "Christian Science."James C. Whorton, Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America,  119. Several writers, including Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine in McClure's, and Martin Gardner, have written that Eddy took many of her ideas from Quimby without giving him any kind of credit. Todd Jay Leonard summarized the controversy: Eddy found that while at first hypnotism seemed to benefit the patient, it later created more problems than the original sickness. Ultimately she rejected any form of hypnotism or mesmerism, stating: "The hypnotizer employs one error to destroy another. If he heals sickness through a belief, and a belief originally caused the sickness, it is a case of the greater error overcoming the lesser.  This greater error thereafter occupies the ground, leaving the case worse than before it was grasped by the stronger error."Eddy, Science and Health, 104:22–28. In the 24th edition of Science and Health, up to the 33rd edition, Eddy admitted the harmony between Vedanta philosophy and Christian Science. She also quoted certain passages from an English translation of the Bhagavad Gita but they were later removed. According to Gill, in the 1891 revision Eddy removed from her book all the references to Eastern religions which her editor, Reverend James Henry Wiggin, had introduced.Gill 1998, 332–333. On this issue Swami Abhedananda wrote: Other writers, such as Jyotirmayananda Saraswati, have said that Eddy may have been influenced by ancient Hindu philosophy.Maya Nanda, Vivekananda: His Gospel of Man-making with a Garland of Tributes and a Chronicle of his Life and Times, wih Pictures, Swami Jyotirmayananda, 1993, 480; Timothy Miller, America's Alternative Religions, State University of New York, 1995, 174. The historian Damodar Singhal wrote: Wendell Thomas in Hinduism Invades America (1930) suggested that Eddy may have discovered Hinduism through the teachings of the New England Transcendentalists such as Bronson Alcott.Wendell Thomas, Hinduism Invades America, The Beacon Press, Inc., 1930, 228–234 (archive.org). Stephen Gottschalk, in his The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life (1973), wrote: In regards to the influence of Eastern religions on her discovery of Christian Science, Eddy states in The First Church of Christ, Scientist and Miscellany: "Think not that Christian Science tends towards Buddhism or any other 'ism'. Per contra, Christian Science destroys such tendency."Eddy, Mary Baker The First Church of Christ, Scientist and Miscellany, page 119, line 10  Eddy devoted the rest of her life to the establishment of the church, writing its bylaws, The Manual of The Mother Church, and revising Science and Health. By the 1870s she was telling her students, "Some day I will have a church of my own."Robert Peel, Mary Baker Eddy, The Years of Trial, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, 62. In 1879 she and her students established the Church of Christ, Scientist, "to commemorate the word and works of our Master [Jesus], which should reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing."Eddy, Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, 1910, 17–18. In 1892 at Eddy's direction, the church reorganized as The First Church of Christ, Scientist,  "designed to be built on the Rock, Christ...."Eddy, Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, 1910, 18–19. Some years later in 1881, she founded the Massachusetts Metaphysical College,Peel 1971, 81–82. where she taught approximately 800 students between the years 1882 and 1889, when she closed it.Peel 1977, 483, n. 104. Eddy charged her students $300 each for tuition. This was a large sum for the period and generated considerable controversy.Eric Caplan, Mind Games: American Culture and the Birth of Psychotherapy, University of California Press, 2001, 75. Her students spread across the country practicing healing, and instructing others. Eddy authorized these students to list themselves as Christian Science Practitioners in the church's periodical, The Christian Science Journal. She also founded the Christian Science Sentinel, a weekly magazine with articles about how to heal and testimonies of healing. In 1888, a reading room selling Bibles, her writings and other publications opened in Boston.A New Home," The Christian Science Journal, September 1888, 317. This model would soon be replicated, and branch churches worldwide maintain more than 1,200 Christian Science Reading Rooms today.See Christian Science Reading Room listings in current edition of the Christian Science Journal. In 1894 an edifice for The First Church of Christ, Scientist was completed in Boston (The Mother Church). In the early years Eddy served as pastor. In 1895 she ordained the Bible and Science and Health as the pastor.NOTES: Eddy, Manual of the Mother Church, 58. Eddy founded The Christian Science Publishing Society in 1898, which became the publishing home for numerous publications launched by her and her followers.Peel 1977, 372. In 1908, at the age of 87, she founded The Christian Science Monitor, a daily newspaper.Gill 1998, xv. She also founded the Christian Science Journal in 1883,Gill 1998, 325. a monthly magazine aimed at the church's members and, in 1898,Gill 1998, 410. the Christian Science Sentinel, a weekly religious periodical written for a more general audience, and the Herald of Christian Science, a religious magazine with editions in many languages.Peel 1977, 415, n. 121. The converse of mental healing was the use of mental powers to destroy people's health – what Eddy termed "malicious animal magnetism." She was concerned that a new practitioner could inadvertently harm a patient through unenlightened use of their mental powers, and that less scrupulous individuals could use such powers as a weapon.Laurence Moore, Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans, Oxford University Press, 1986. In 1872 Eddy had an argument with her student Richard Kennedy and he was expelled from Christian Science. Later she came to believe that he was using mental powers to destroy her so she ordered her students to "mobilize all their mental energy to combat him".Ruth A. Tucker, Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement, 157. Eddy also ordered her students to stand outside her bedroom door to protect her from any mental attacks directed at her. In 1882 Eddy publicly claimed that her last husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy, had died of "mental assassination".Miller 1995, 62. Daniel Spofford was another Christian Scientist expelled by Eddy after she accused him of practicing malicious animal magnetism.John S. Haller, American Medicine in Transition, 1840-1910, 139. According to Eugene V. Gallagher: The belief in malicious animal magnetism "remains a part of the doctrine of Christian Science."William Williams, Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy. Facts on File, 2000. In an article entitled "Malicious Animal Magnetism" published in the Christian Science Journal, February 1889, Eddy wrote that mental assassination was one of the greatest crimes and that anyone practicing it should be put to death by a human executioner.Frederick W. Peabody, Religio-Medical Masquerade, 172. Several persons committed suicide because of the fear of malicious animal magnetism.Charles Locke, Eddyism: Is it Christian? Is it Scientific? How Long Will it Last?, Grafton Publishing Company, 1911, 39. Mary Tomlinson, a student of Mary Baker Eddy, committed suicide by throwing herself out of a window.Edwin Dakin, Mrs. Eddy: the biography of a virginal mind, Blue Ribbon Books, 1930, 462. Another Christian Scientist Marion Stephens committed suicide by gassing herself in a bathroom."Lay Eddyite Suicide to 'Death Thought'. Malicious Animal Magnetism" Said to Have Caused Miss Stephens to End Her Life", The New York Times. In her later years Eddy apparently became paranoid, believing that 50,000 people were trying to kill her by projecting their evil thoughts.Bates and Dittemore 1932. Eddy wrote that if she died it would be due to malicious animal magnetism rather than from natural causes.Tucker 2004, 166.  In 1907 Mark Twain published a satirical diatribe attacking Eddy, entitled Christian Science:   When Harper's refused to publish an earlier essay of his on Christian Science in 1903, Twain interpreted the rejection as suppression caused by pressure from Christian Scientists and wrote, "The situation is not barren of humour. I had been doing my best to show in print that the Xn Scientist cult has become a power in the land – well, here is the proof: it has scared the biggest publisher in the Union."Reasonings: The Official Newsletter of Rationalists of Greater Madison, a Chapter of the Freedom from Religion Foundation, Issues 1-66, The Rationalists, 1989, p. 47 Twain later offered another appraisal of Eddy, reported by his biographer Albert Bigelow Paine: A diary kept by Calvin Frye (1845-1917), Eddy's personal secretary, suggested that Eddy had a lifelong dependence on morphine, but the credibility of this diary is in question.  It is highly likely that this diary was stolen and the following testimony of Miranda Rice was falsely entered.Gardner 1993. Rice, an early student of Eddy who later defected from the church, told a newspaper in 1906: "I know that Mrs. Eddy was addicted to morphine in the seventies. She begged me to get some for her. She sent her husband Mr. Eddy for some, and when he failed to get it went herself and got it. She locked herself into her room and for two days excluded every one. She was a slave to morphine."Fleta Springer, According to the Flesh: A Biography of Mary Baker Eddy, Coward-McCann, 1930, 299. Biographer Gillian Gill believes that, regardless of the diary entry's authenticity, it does not support the idea that Eddy was addicted to morphine.Gill 1998, 546. Eddy had her grandchildren vaccinated and paid for a mastectomy for her sister-in-law.Whorton 2004, 128. Eddy was quoted in the New York Herald on 1 May 1901: "Where vaccination is compulsory, let your children be vaccinated, and see that your mind is in such a state that by your prayers vaccination will do the children no harm. So long as Christian Scientists obey the laws, I do not suppose their mental reservations will be thought to matter much."Eddy, General Miscellany, 344–345.  Eddy recognized that, regardless of the administration of the drugs, the drugs would have no effect and thus "do the children no harm" hence proving the legitimacy of her discovery that matter cannot effect matter.  She showed that by obeying the man made law you cannot then break the greater laws of Spirit. Eddy used glasses for several years for very fine print, but later dispensed with them almost entirely.Peel 1977, 108–109, 411, n. 65. She found she could read fine print with ease.Peel 1971, 376. In 1907 Arthur Brisbane interviewed Eddy. At one point he picked up a periodical, selected at random a paragraph, and asked Eddy to read it. According to Brisbane, at the age of eighty six, she read the ordinary magazine type without glasses.Arthur Brisbane,  "An Interview with Mrs. Eddy," Cosmopolitan Magazine, August 1907. It is suggested that towards the end of her life she was frequently attended by physicians.  However, this is highly speculative as there is no actual research to back up these claims.Rodney Stark, "The Rise and Fall of Christian Science", Journal of Contemporary Religion, 13(2), 1988, 189–214. In 1907, in the course of a legal case, four psychiatrists interviewed Eddy, then 86 years old, to determine whether she could manage her own affairs, and concluded that she was able to.Bates and Dittemore 1932, 411, 413, 417. Dr. Allan McLane Hamilton (1848–1919), told The New York Times that the attacks on Eddy were the result of "a spirit of religious persecution that has at last quite overreached itself," and that "there seems to be a manifest injustice in taxing so excellent and capable an old lady as Mrs. Eddy with any form of insanity."The New York Times 1907. Psychiatrist George Eman Vaillant wrote that Eddy was hypochrondriacal.George Vaillant, Ego Mechanisms of Defense: A Guide for Clinicans and Researchers, American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1992, 70 Psychologists Leon Joseph Saul and Silas L. Warner, in their book The Psychotic Personality (1982), came to the conclusion that Eddy had diagnostic characteristics of Psychotic Personality Disorder (PPD).Leon Saul and Silas Warner, The Psychotic Personality, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1982, 287–288.  Eddy died of pneumonia on the evening of December 3, 1910 at her home at 400 Beacon Street, in the Chestnut Hill section of Newton, Massachusetts. Her death was announced the next morning, when a city medical examiner was called in."Mrs. Eddy Dies Of Pneumonia; No Doctor Near", The New York Times, December 5, 1910: "Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist, died Saturday night at 10:45 o'clock. The death was kept a secret until this morning, when a city medical examiner was called in. It was first publicly announced at the Mother Church this morning. Mrs. Eddy was in her ninetieth year." She was buried on December 8, 1910 at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her memorial was designed by New York architect Egerton Swartwout (1870-1943). Hundreds of tributes appeared in newspapers around the world, including The Boston Globe, which wrote, "She did a wonderful—an extraordinary work in the world and there is no doubt that she was a powerful influence for good.""Mrs. Eddy's Life and Achievement," The Boston Globe, December 5, 1910, 4. Currently, there are almost 1,700 Christian Science churches in 76 countries.See Christian Science Church listings in current issue of The Christian Science Journal. Eddy's book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures has been a best seller for decades, and was selected as one of the "75 Books By Women Whose Words Have Changed The World," by the Women's National Book Association.75 Books by Women Whose Words Have Changed the World In 1995 Eddy was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.National Women's Hall of Fame: Mary Baker Eddy In 2002, The Mary Baker Eddy Library opened its doors, giving the public access to one of the largest collections about an American woman.The Mary Baker Eddy Library For more than a century, The Christian Science Journal and the Christian Science Sentinel have been publishing accounts of restored health based on the system of care that Eddy taught. The Christian Science Monitor newspaper has won seven Pulitzer Prizes to date.The Pulitzer Prizes In 1921, on the 100th anniversary of Eddy's birth, a 100-ton (in rough) and 60–70 tons (hewn), a pyramid with a 121 square foot footprint was dedicated on the site of her birthplace in Bow, New Hampshire. A gift from James F. Lord, it was dynamited in 1962 by order of the church's board of directors. Also demolished was Eddy's former home in Pleasant View, as the board feared that it was becoming a place of pilgrimage.Andrew W. Hartsook, Christian Science After 1910, Bookmark, 1994, 25–28.
