 The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) F-15E Strike Eagle is an American all-weather multirole strike fighter, derived from the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. The F-15E was designed in the 1980s for long-range, high speed interdiction without relying on escort or electronic-warfare aircraft. United States Air Force (USAF) F-15E Strike Eagles can be distinguished from other U.S. Eagle variants by darker aircraft camouflage and conformal fuel tanks mounted along the engine intake ramps. The Strike Eagle has been deployed for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, among others.  During these operations the F-15E has carried out deep strikes against high-value targets, combat air patrols, and provided close air support for coalition troops. It has also been exported to several countries. The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle had been introduced by the United States Air Force (USAF) as a replacement for its fleet of McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs. However, unlike the F-4, the F-15 was strictly designed for the air-superiority mission with little consideration for a ground-attack role; the F-15 Special Project Office opposed the idea of F-15s performing the interdiction mission, giving rise to the phrase "Not a pound for air to ground."Davies and Dildy 2007, pp. 9, 15, 20, 35. In service, the F-15 was a very successful fighter, with over 100 aerial combat victories and no losses in air-to-air combat.Davies and Dildy 2007, inside cover.Spick 2000, p. 127. Despite a lack of official interest, McDonnell Douglas quietly worked on an F-15-derived interdictor fighter. The company envisaged the aircraft as a replacement for the General Dynamics F-111 and the remaining F-4s, as well as to augment the existing F-15s.Donald 1995, p. 40. In 1978, the USAF initiated the Tactical All-Weather Requirement Study (TAWRS) which looked at McDonnell Douglas's proposal and other options such as the purchase of further F-111Fs. TAWRS recommended the F-15E as the USAF's future strike platform.Donald 1995, p. 42. In 1979, McDonnell Douglas and Hughes began a close collaboration on the development of the F-15E's air-to-ground capabilities.Davies 2003, pp. 15–16. To assist in the F-15E's development, McDonnell Douglas modified the second TF-15A prototype, serial number 71-0291, as a demonstrator. The aircraft, known as the Advanced Fighter Capability Demonstrator, first flew on 8 July 1980. It was previously used to trial conformal fuel tanks (CFT), initially designed for the F-15 under the designation "FAST Pack", with FAST standing for "Fuel and Sensor, Tactical.  It was subsequently fitted with a Pave Tack laser designator targeting pod to allow the independent delivery of guided bombs.Jenkins 1997, p. 42. The demonstrator was displayed at the 1980 Farnborough Airshow.Donald 1995, p. 44. In March 1981, the USAF announced the Enhanced Tactical Fighter (ETF) program to procure a replacement for the F-111. The program was later renamed the Dual-Role Fighter (DRF) competition. The concept envisioned an aircraft capable of launching deep air interdiction missions without requiring additional support by fighter escort or jamming.Rininger 2009, pp. 85, 88. General Dynamics submitted the F-16XL, while McDonnell Douglas submitted the F-15E. The Panavia Tornado was also a candidate, but since the aircraft lacked a credible air superiority fighter capability, coupled with the fact that it is not American-made, it was not seriously considered.  The DRF evaluation team, under the direction of Brigadier General Ronald W. Yates, ran from 1981 through 30 April 1983, during which the F-15E logged more than 200 flights, demonstrated take off weight of more than , and validated sixteen different weapons-carrying configurations.Donald 1995, p. 45. McDonnell Douglas, to assist 71-0291 in the evaluation, added to the program other F-15s, designated 78-0468, 80–0055 and 81-0063. The single-engine F-16XL was a promising design which, with its radically redesigned cranked-delta wing, greatly boosted performance; if selected, the single- and two-seat versions were to be designated F-16E and F-16F, respectively. On 24 February 1984, the USAF chose the F-15E; key factors in the decision were the F-15E's lower development costs compared to the F-16XL (US$270 million versus US$470 million), a belief that the F-15E had future growth potential, and possessing twin-engine redundancy.Jenkins 1998, p. 36.Ciborski, James R. "The F-15 Eagle: A Chronology." History Office, Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, June 2002. The USAF was initially expected to procure 400 aircraft, a figure later revised to 392.Ulsamer, Edgar. "In Focus: The Dual-Role Eagle." Air Force magazine, April 1984. Construction of the first three F-15Es started in July 1985. The first of these, 86-0183, made its maiden flight on 11 December 1986. Piloted by Gary Jennings, the aircraft reached a maximum speed of Mach 0.9 and an altitude of 40,000&nbsp;feet (12,000&nbsp;m) during the 75-minute flight. This aircraft had the full F-15E avionics suite and the redesigned front fuselage, but not the aft fuselage and the common engine bay. The latter was featured on 86-0184, while 86-0185 incorporated all the changes of the F-15E from the F-15. On 31 March 1987, the first officially completed F-15E made its first flight.Rininger 2009, p. 89. The first production F-15E was delivered to the 405th Tactical Training Wing, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona in April 1988. Production continued into the 2000s with 236 produced for the USAF through 2001."Boeing F-15E Eagle." Jane's All the World's Aircraft, Jane's Information Group, 2010 (subscription article, dated 26 February 2010). The F-15E will be upgraded with the Raytheon APG-82 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar after 2007, and the first test radar was delivered to Boeing in 2010.Frost, Patricia.

"Making the Best of the Fighter Force." Air Force magazine, March 2007. As of December 2012, the USAF's F-15E fleet has an average age of 21 years and an average airframe flying time of 6,000 hours. In 2012, the Air Force was reportedly considering future options; there is no slated replacement for the F-15E. One choice is the F-35 Lightning II, set to replace other attack aircraft such as the F-16 Falcon and A-10 Thunderbolt II; a "F-35E" variant was studied. It would be complex, and thus expensive, to add a second seat to the F-35, especially to preserve its stealth profile; providing for greater range and payload would also be difficult tasks. Alternatively, the role could be covered by a combination of fighter and bomber aircraft, such as the planned Long Range Strike Bomber. The F-15E may also be replaced by a clean-sheet sixth-generation aircraft design.USAF mulls options for replacement of Boeing F-15E Strike Eagle - Flightglobal.com, 13 December 2012.What will replace the F-15E Strike Eagle? - Flightglobal.com, 17 December 2012. On 24 March 2014, Boeing won a $30.6 million contract from DARPA as part of the Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program.  The goal of the program is to cut the cost of putting microsatellites into orbit by 66 percent through advances in launch systems.  Under the 11-month contract, Boeing will build twelve  launch vehicles, each with a payload capability of up to .  An ALASA vehicle is to be fitted under an F-15E, which will climb to 40,000&nbsp;ft, then be released and fire its four engines to reach low-Earth orbit.  Awarding the contract to Boeing would make use of the F-15E as the carriage vehicle, as previous design contracts had been given to Lockheed Martin to use the F-22 Raptor and Virgin Galactic to use their SpaceShip Two aircraft.  DARPA had previously insisted they wanted to select an aircraft they would not need to modify heavily to carry and launch the ALASA payload.Boeing wins contract to design DARPA Airborne Satellite Launch Vehicle - Boeing press release, 27 March 2014Boeing Targets 66 Percent Launch Cost Reduction with ALASA - Spacenews.com, 28 March 2014 The F-15E's deep strike mission is a radical departure from the original intent of the F-15, since the F-15 was designed as an air superiority fighter under the mantra "not a pound for air-to-ground."Hallion, Dr. Richard P. "A Troubling Past: Air Force Fighter Acquisition since 1945." Airpower Journal, Winter 1990. Retrieved: 1 September 2011. The basic airframe, however, proved versatile enough to produce a very capable strike fighter. The F-15E, while designed for ground attack, retains the air-to-air lethality of the F-15, and can defend itself against enemy aircraft.Jenkins 1998, pp. 35–36. The F-15E prototype was a modification of the two-seat F-15B. The F-15E, despite its origins, includes significant structural changes and much more powerful engines. The aft fuselage was designed to incorporate the more powerful engines with advanced engine bay structures and doors.  The advanced structures utilized Superplastic forming and diffusion bonding (SPF/DB) technologies.  The back seat is equipped for a Weapon Systems Officer (WSO pronounced 'wizzo') to work the new air-to-ground avionics. The WSO uses multiple screens to display information from the radar, electronic warfare, or Thermographic cameras, monitor aircraft or weapons status and possible threats, select targets, and use an electronic moving map to navigate. Two hand controls are used to select new displays and to refine targeting information. Displays can be moved from one screen to another, chosen from a menu of display options. Unlike earlier two-place jets (e.g. the F-14 Tomcat and Navy variants of the F-4), whose back seat lacked flying controls, the back seat of the F-15E cockpit is equipped with its own stick and throttle so the WSO can take over flying, albeit with reduced visibility.Davies 2003, pp. 63–64.  To extend its range, the F-15E is fitted with two conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) that hug the fuselage.  These produce lower drag than conventional underwing/underbelly drop tanks. They carry 750 U.S. gallons (2,800 liters) of fuel, and house six weapons hardpoints in two rows of three in tandem. Unlike conventional drop tanks, CFTs cannot be jettisoned, thus the increased range is offset by the degraded performance from the increased drag and weight compared to a "clean" configuration. Similar tanks can be mounted on the F-15C/D and export variants, and the Israeli Air Force makes use of this option on their fighter-variant F-15s as well as their F-15I variant of the Strike Eagle, but the F-15E is the only U.S. variant to be routinely fitted with CFTs. The Strike Eagle's tactical electronic warfare system (TEWS) integrates all countermeasures on the craft: radar warning receivers (RWR), radar jammer, radar, and chaff/flare dispensers are all tied to the TEWS to provide comprehensive defense against detection and tracking. This system includes an externally mounted ALQ-131 ECM pod which is carried on the centerline pylon when required. The APG-70 radar system allows air crews to detect ground targets from longer ranges. One feature of this system is that after a sweep of a target area, the crew freezes the air-to-ground map then goes back into air-to-air mode to clear for air threats. During the air-to-surface weapon delivery, the pilot is capable of detecting, targeting and engaging air-to-air targets while the WSO designates the ground target. The APG-70 is to be replaced by the AN/APG-82(v)1 active electronically scanned array Radar (AESA) radar, which will begin flight tests in January 2010 with initial operational capability expected in 2014.Frost, Patricia. "Boeing F-15E Radar Modernization Program Receives New Designation." Boeing, 15 September 2009. Its inertial navigation system uses a laser gyroscope to continuously monitor the aircraft's position and provide information to the central computer and other systems, including a digital moving map in both cockpits.  The low-altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night (LANTIRN) system is mounted externally under the engine intakes; it allows the aircraft to fly at low altitudes, at night and in any weather conditions, to attack ground targets with a variety of precision-guided and unguided weapons. The LANTIRN system gives the F-15E exceptional accuracy in weapons delivery day or night and in poor weather, and consists of two pods attached to the exterior of the aircraft. At night, the video picture from the LANTIRN can be projected on the HUD, producing an infrared image of ground contour.Jenkins 1998, pp. 100–101.  The navigation pod contains a terrain-following radar which allows the pilot to safely fly at a very low altitude following cues displayed on a heads up display. This system also can be coupled to the aircraft's autopilot to provide "hands off" terrain-following capability. Additionally, the pod contains a forward looking infrared system which is projected on the pilot's HUD which is used during nighttime or low visibility operations. The AN/AAQ-13 Nav Pod is installed beneath the right engine intake. The targeting pod contains a laser designator and a tracking system that mark an enemy for destruction as far away as 10&nbsp;mi (16&nbsp;km). Once tracking has been started, targeting information is automatically handed off to infrared homing air-to-surface missiles or laser-guided bombs. The targeting pod is mounted beneath the left engine intake; configurations may be either the AN/AAQ-14 Target Pod, AN/AAQ-28 LITENING Target Pod or the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod. The F-15E carries most weapons in the USAF inventory. It is also armed with AIM-9 Sidewinders and AIM-120 AMRAAMs. Since the Strike Eagle retains the counter-air capabilities from its Eagle lineage, it is regularly trained for counter-air missions, and fully capable for Offensive-Counter-Air. Like the F-15C, the Strike Eagle also carries an internally mounted General Electric M61A1 20&nbsp;mm cannon with 650 rounds, which is effective against enemy aircraft and "soft" ground targets.

The F-15E saw action in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 for Operation Desert Shield. The 336th Tactical Fighter Squadron flew to Seeb Air Base in Oman to begin training exercises in anticipation of an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia; in December, the 335th and 336th squadrons relocated to Al Kharj Air Base in Saudi Arabia, closer to Iraq's border.Davies 2005, p. 14.  Operation Desert Storm began on 17 January 1991; 24 F-15Es launched an attack upon five fixed Scud installations in western Iraq; missions against Scud sites continued through that night with a second strike consist of 21 F-15Es. At night-time, F-15Es flew hunter missions over western Iraq, searching for mobile SCUD launchers. By conducting random bombings in suspected areas, it was hoped to deter the Iraqis from setting up for a Scud launch.Davies 2005, p. 22. On the opening night of the war, an F-15E fired a AIM-9 Sidewinder at a MiG-29, which failed to hit its target. Other F-15Es simultaneously and unsuccessfully engaged the lone MiG-29, it was eventually brought down by a missile of unknown source."Tim Bennett's War." Air Force magazine online, January 1993.Davies 2005, pp. 17–24.  The same night another flight was attacked by a MiG-29.  A low altitude engagement ensued and the MiG-29 hit the ground. On 18 January, during a strike against a petrol oil and lubricant plant near Basrah, an F-15E was lost to enemy fire, the pilot and WSO were killed. F-15E crews described this mission as the most difficult and dangerous of the war as it was heavily defended by SA-3s, SA-6s, SA-8s and Rolands as well as by anti-aircraft artillery. Two nights later, a second and final F-15E was downed by an Iraqi SA-2; the crew survived and managed to evade capture for several days and even made in contact with coalition aircraft, but rescue was unable to be launched due to security issues, one airman failed to identify himself with proper codes. The two airmen were later captured by the Iraqis.Davies 2005, p. 25.  Strike Eagles were able to destroy 18 Iraqi jets on the ground at Tallil air base using GBU-12s and CBU-87s. On 14 February, an F-15E scored its only air-to-air kill: a Mil Mi-24 helicopter. While responding to a request for help by US Special Forces, five Iraqi helicopters were spotted. The lead F-15E of two acquired a helicopter via its FLIR in the process of unloading Iraqi soldiers, and released a GBU-10 bomb. The F-15E crew thought the bomb had missed its target and were preparing to use a Sidewinder when the helicopter was destroyed. The Special Forces team estimated that the Hind was roughly  over the ground when the  bomb hit its target.Davies 2005, pp. 29–30. As Coalition bombing operation had commenced, the F-15Es disengaged from combat with the remaining helicopters. F-15Es attacked various heavily defended targets throughout Iraq, prioritizing SCUD missile sites. Missions with the objective of killing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were undertaken, several suspected locations were bombed by F-15Es. Prior to the operation's ground war phase, F-15Es conducted tank plinking missions against Iraqi vehicles in Kuwait. Following 42 days of heavy combat, a cease fire came into effect on 1 March 1991, leading to the establishment of Northern and Southern no-fly zones over Iraq. Following Desert Storm, two no-fly zones over Iraq were set up, and enforced typically by US and UK aircraft. In one incident, an attack on up to 600 Kurdish refugees by Iraqi helicopters at Chamchamal, northern Iraq, was observed by a flight of F-15Es. As they were not allowed to open fire, the F-15Es instead conducted several high speed passes as close as possible to the Iraqi helicopters to create severe wake-turbulence, while aiming lasers at the helicopter's cockpits to attempt to blind their crews; this caused the crash of one Hind. Afterwards, USAF leadership ordered F-15Es not to fly below  to deter a repetition.Davies 2005, pp. 30–31. F-15Es of the 391st Fighter Squadron, 492d Fighter Squadron, and 494th Fighter Squadron regularly deployed to Turkey throughout the 1990s. In January 1993, Iraqi targets in breach of the ceasefire agreement below the 32nd parallel north were attacked; 10 F-15Es conducted a punitive strike days later.Davies 2005, p. 33. Most missions were of a defensive nature, the Strike Eagles carried a flexible range of weapons on a typical mission. AWACS aircraft were in close contact with F-15E crews, who would receive new taskings while airborne and thus could fly unplanned attacks on Iraqi targets. After 1993, violations of the no-fly zones were minimal as Iraq staged a minor withdrawal; in 1997 Turkey approved the creation of Operation Northern Watch (ONW) and permitted US forces to use the Incirlik air base. In December 1998, Operation Desert Fox was conducted when Iraq refused UNSCOM inspections. On 28 December 1998, three F-15Es each dropped two GBU-12 500-pound precision-guided munitions (PGMs) to successfully strike an SA-3 tracking radar and optical guidance unit."Operation Northern Watch 1998 Events." GlobalSecurity.org, 5 June 2011. After Desert Fox, Iraq stepped up its violations of the no-fly zones, thus a number of retaliatory and pre-planned strikes were conducted by F-15Es; in ONW alone, weapons were expended on at least 105 days.Davies 2005, pp. 35–36. Between 24 and 26 January 1999, F-15Es expended several AGM-130s and GBU-12s against SAM sites in northern Iraq near Mosul.Davies 2005, p. 35. Several F-15Es also flew in support of Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Provide Comfort II. Operation Deny Flight was a United Nations-enforced no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina due to the deteriorating situation in the Balkans. In August 1993, F-15Es from 492d and 494th FS deployed to Aviano, Italy. In late 1993, NATO ordered a limited F-15E strike at Udbina airfield, targeting Serbian forces in neighboring Croatia. Eight F-15Es armed with GBU-12s took off to attack an SA-6 anti-aircraft vehicle; the mission was cancelled mid-flight over the application of stringent Rules of Engagement.Davies 2005, p. 43. In December 1993, F-15Es launched to destroy a pair of SA-2 sites which had fired upon two Royal Navy Sea Harrier FRS 1s.Davies 2005, p. 44. In August 1995, F-15Es of 90th Fighter Squadron joined the two other squadrons. The 492d and 494th flew over 2,500 sorties since Deny Flight had begun, 2,000 of these were by 492d. In August 1995, in support of NATO's Operation Deliberate Force, F-15Es flew strike missions against Serbian armor and logistics around the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. On 9 September, an F-15E deployed the first GBU-15 bomb for the type; a total of nine were dropped against Bosnian-Serb ground forces and air defense targets around Banja Luka. In response to the displacement of Kosovars and the Serbian government's rejection of a NATO ultimatum, Operation Allied Force was launched in March 1999.  A total of 26 F-15Es flew the first strikes of Allied Force against Serb surface-to-air-missile sites, anti-aircraft batteries and Early Warning radar stations.Davies 2005, p. 46. Strike Eagles were deployed to Aviano as well as RAF Lakenheath in the UK. In-theater, F-15Es conducted Close Air Support missions, a new idea in the late 1990s which has since become a popular concept within the USAF.Davies 2005, p. 47. Missions typically lasted around 7.5&nbsp;hours, included two aerial refuelings; F-15Es would carry a mix of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions to perform both Combat Air Patrol duties as well as strike missions in the same mission. Mobile SAM launchers posed a considerable threat to NATO aircraft and had made successful shoot-downs, most notably of a Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk. In order to strike from increased distances, the F-15E was equipped with the AGM-130, which provided a stand-off strike capability.Davies 2005, p. 59. Weeks after the  in 2001, the 391st Fighter Squadron deployed to Ahmed Al Jaber air base, Kuwait, to support Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. F-15Es met little resistance during initial missions, in the first night targets ranged from Taliban military structures and supply depots, to al-Qaeda training camps and caves were the main targets. Both the AGM-130 and GBU-15  bombs were expended, this was the GBU-15's first combat usage.Davies 2005, p. 63. GBU-24s and GBU-28s were used against reinforced targets, command and control centers and cave entrances. F-15Es often operated in pairs alongside pairs of F-16Cs. Within weeks of the start of combat operations, there was a lack of targets to strike as nearly all targets had been already destroyed. The Taliban had access to SA-7 and FIM-92 Stinger portable surface-to-air missiles, posing no threat to most aircraft flying above . Additionally, fixed SAM sites near cities as Mazar-i-Sharif and Bagram were struck early on; Afghanistan had rapidly became a low-threat environment for air operations.Davies 2005, p. 64. Aircraft commonly flew on-call support missions for allied ground forces, F-15Es usually carried MK-82 and GBU-12 bombs in this role, other weapons were sometimes carried, during one mission a GBU-28, two GBU-24s and six GBU-12s were released. Frequent targets during the rest of the war were individual insurgents, light vehicles and supply convoys; cannon fire was often expended as well as bombs from F-15Es.Davies 2005, p. 65. It was during combat over Afghanistan that four 391st crews conducted the longest fighter mission in history; lasting a total of 15.5&nbsp;hours, nine of those hours spent flying over the target area. Two F-15Es attacked two Taliban command and control facilities, two buildings suspected of being used by Taliban fighters, and a road block; the F-15Es refueled 12 times during the mission.Davies 2005, pp. 68–69.  On 4 March, another incident now known as the Battle of Roberts’ Ridge involved several F-15Es that had embarked on a Close Air Support mission for ground forces. Aircraft destroyed a Taliban observation post and responded to nearby enemy mortar fire upon Navy SEAL forces on a search for an ambushed MH-47E Chinook in the Shah-i-Kot Valley.Davies 2005, p. 72. Several bombs were dropped as the SEAL team still took fire, however one bomb missed due to the wrong coordinates being entered by the aircrew. An MH-47 carrying a rescue team was downed by an RPG while attempting to support the SEALs.Davies 2005, p. 73. Following refueling, the F-15Es dropped a further 11 GBU-12s in coordination with ground forces, and fired their cannons on Taliban forces in close proximity to the survivors of the downed MH-47. A section of F-16s from 18th Fighter Squadron made strafing passes as well until cannon ammunition was depleted, before resorting to further bomb drops. The F-15Es were affected by technical problems involving both radios and weapons that had failed, several GBU-12's were dropped before returning to Al Jaber in Kuwait.Davies 2005, p. 76.

In late 2002, during tension over suspected Iraqi possession of weapons of mass destruction, the 4th Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson AFB was ordered to maintain at least one squadron ready to deploy to the Persian Gulf. During January 2003, the 336th was deployed to Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, a total of 24 aircraft were deployed to Al Udeid in coordination with planners of the Combined Air Operations Center at Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia.Davies 2005, pp. 77–78. In late January, the F-15Es began flying in support of Operation Southern Watch, typically performing surveillance and reconnaissance missions, additional missions included simulated combat against potential Iraqi targets and regional familiarization with local procedures and Rules of Engagements. During OSW, F-15Es attacked a number of targets in southern and western Iraq, including radars, radio communications and relay stations, command and control sites, and air defences. On one night, four F-15Es fired multiple GBU-24s at the Iraqi Republican Guard/Baath Party HQ in Basrah while another flight of four destroyed a nearby Air Defense Sector HQ with six GBU-10s.Davies 2005, p. 80. Towards the end of February, the 336th received additional aircrews, many of which being drafted from the two non-deployable squadrons at Seymour Johnson (the 333d and 334th Fighter Squadrons) and 391st Fighter Squadron at Mountain Home Air Force Base, for a total of four aircrews per F-15E. In early March, the 335th Fighter Squadron's personnel and aircraft joined the 336th at Al Udeid. One objective was the destruction of Iraq's air defenses and Early Warning radar network near the border with Jordan, allowing F-16s and Special Forces helicopters to operate from Jordan at the outset of the war. Several radar sites and radio relay stations were hit in western Iraq near the "H3" airfield, during these missions coalition jets met with heavy anti-aircraft fire.Davies 2005, p. 82. On 19 March, as F-117 Nighthawks dropped bombs over Baghdad, targeting a house where Saddam Hussein was believed to be; F-15Es dropped GBU-28s around the H3 airfield.

They also scored hits on 65 MiGs on the ground, and destroyed key air defense and command buildings in Baghdad. During the war F-15Es worked closely with other jets that were deployed to Al Udeid, including RAAF F/A-18s, USAF F-16s and F-117s, RAF Panavia Tornado fighters and a detachment of US Navy F-14s from VF-154. Following the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on 17 March 2011, 18 USAF F-15E fighters, and a variety of other NATO and allied aircraft were deployed to enforce the Libyan no-fly zone as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn.

After the Gulf War in 1991, in which Israeli towns were attacked by SCUD missiles based in Iraq, the Israeli government decided that it needed a long range strike aircraft and issued a Request for Information (RFI). In response, Lockheed Martin offered a version of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, while McDonnell Douglas offered both the F/A-18 Hornet and the F-15E. On 27 January 1994, the Israeli government announced that the intention to purchase 21 modified F-15Es, designated F-15I. On 12 May 1994, the US Government authorized the purchase of up to 25 F-15Is by Israel. In November 1995, Israel ordered four extra F-15Is, thus 25 were built from 1996 to 1998. The first F-15I combat mission was flown in Lebanon on 11 January 1999. The aircraft can carry: the AIM-9L, Rafael Python 4 and the Rafael Python 5 infrared-homing missiles; and the AIM-7 Sparrow and the AIM-120 AMRAAM radar-guided missiles. The Python 4 can be launched at up to 90 degrees off boresight, with the pilot aiming using the helmet-mounted sight. In 1999, Israel announced its intention to procure more fighter aircraft, and the F-15I was a possible contender. However, it was announced that the contract would go to the F-16I. In November 2009, Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s, along with Saudi Tornados, performed air raids during the Houthi insurgency in north Yemen.

The F-15I is operated by the Israeli Air Force where it is known as the Ra'am (רעם – "Thunder").  It is a dual-seat ground attack aircraft powered by two Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-229 engines, and is based on the F-15E. The F-15I Ra'am is similar to the F-15E, but features several different avionic systems to meet Israeli requirements. To facilitate night-time strikes, the F-15Is were initially fitted with Sharpshooter targeting pods designed for Israeli F-16s. The Sharpshooter pod was less capable than the LANTIRN pods used on USAF F-15Es; Israel later purchased 30 LANTIRN pods. The F-15Is initially lacked Radar Warning Receivers, Israel installed its own electronic warfare equipment, the Elisra SPS-2110, as well as a new central computer and embedded GPS/INS system. All sensors can be slaved to the Display And Sight Helmet (DASH) helmet-mounted sight, providing both crew members a means of targeting which the F-15E lacks. The F-15I uses the APG-70I radar; its terrain mapping capability can locate targets difficult to spot while under adverse weather conditions.
