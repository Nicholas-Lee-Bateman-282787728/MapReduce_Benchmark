   Carleton College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in the historic town of Northfield, Minnesota. The college enrolled 2,014 undergraduate students and employed 245 instructional faculty members in fall 2015. Carleton is one of few liberal arts colleges that runs on the trimester system. In its 2016 edition of national liberal arts college rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranked Carleton eighth-best overall and first for undergraduate teaching The 1,040-acre rural campus is located next to the adjoining 880-acre Cowling Arboretum, which became part of the campus in 1920. The school's location in Northfield places it 40 miles from the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan complex. The architecture of campus buildings ranges from Collegiate Gothic to contemporary, with the first building built in 1872 and the most recent in 2011. Since 2000, the institution has produced 104 National Science Graduate Fellows, 91 Fulbright Scholars, 24 NCAA Postgraduate Scholars, 21 Watson Fellows, 13 Goldwater Scholars, and 2 Rhodes Scholars.[ ] Carleton is also one of the largest sources of undergraduate students pursuing doctorates per one hundred students for bachelors institutions.Baccalaureate Origins Peer Analysis, Centre College, accessed February 23, 2008National Science Foundation| url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf08311/ In 2015, the school was designated a "Top Producer of Fulbright Awards for American Students at Bachelors Institutions" with 4 grants awarded that year, ranking it tied for 29th for undergraduate student awards. The school was founded on October 12, 1866, when the Minnesota Conference of Congregational Churches unanimously accepted a resolution to locate a college in Northfield. Two Northfield businessmen, Charles Augustus Wheaton and Charles M. Goodsell, each donated  of land for the first campus.  The first students enrolled at the preparatory unit of Northfield College in the fall of 1867. In 1870, the first college president, James Strong, traveled to the East Coast to raise funds for the college. On his way from visiting a potential donor, William Carleton of Charlestown, Massachusetts, Strong was badly injured in a collision between his carriage and a train. Impressed by Strong's survival of the accident, Carleton donated $50,000 to the fledgling institution in 1871. As a result, the Board of Trustees renamed the school in his honor. The college graduated its first college class in 1874, in which the first two graduates, James J. Dow and Myra A. Brown, married each other later that year. On September 7, 1876, the James-Younger Gang, led by outlaw Jesse James, tried to rob the First National Bank of Northfield. Joseph Lee Heywood, Carleton's Treasurer, was acting cashier at the bank that day. He was shot and killed for refusing to open the safe. Carleton later named a library fund after Heywood. The Heywood Society is the name for a group of donors who have named Carleton in their wills. In its early years under the presidency of James Strong, Carleton reflected the theological conservatism of its Minnesota Congregational founders. In 1903, modern religious influences were introduced by William Sallmon, a Yale Divinity School graduate, who was hired as college president. Sallmon was opposed by conservative faculty members and alumni, and left the presidency by 1908.  After Sallmon left, the trustees hired Donald J. Cowling, another theologically liberal Yale Divinity School graduate, as his successor. In 1916, under Cowling's leadership, Carleton began an official affiliation with the Minnesota Baptist Convention. It lasted until 1928, when the Baptists severed the relationship as a result of fundamentalist opposition to Carleton's liberalism, including the college's support for teaching evolution.Mark A. Greene, "The Baptist Fundamentalists Case Against Carleton, 1926-1928", Minnesota History magazine, Spring 1990, pp. 16-26, Minnesota Historical Society. Non-denominational for a number of years, in 1964 Carleton abolished its requirement for weekly attendance at some religious or spiritual meeting. In 1927, students founded the first student-run pub in the nation, The Cave. Located in the basement of Evans Hall, it continues to host live music shows and other events several times each week. In 1942, Carleton purchased land in Stanton, about  east of campus, to use for flight training. During World War II, several classes of male students went through air basic training at the college. Since being sold by the college in 1944, the Stanton Airfield has been operated for commercial use.Stanton Airfield site, with history The world premiere production of the English translation of Bertolt Brecht's play, The Caucasian Chalk Circle, was performed in 1948 at Carleton's Nourse Little Theater. In 1963 the Reformed Druids of North America was founded by students at Carleton, initially as a means to be excused from attendance of then-mandatory weekly chapel service.  Within a few years, the group evolved to engage in legitimate spiritual exploration.  Meetings continue to be held in the Carleton College Cowling Arboretum. President Bill Clinton gave the last commencement address of his administration at Carleton, on June 10, 2000, marking the first presidential visit to the college. The school saw an increase in applicants in 2001, with over 4,000 applying for entry into the institution. Carleton is a small, liberal arts college offering 39 different majors and 16 concentrations, and is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The academic calendar is unusual in that it follows a trimester system not commonly seen in institutions of higher learning, where students usually take 3 classes per term. In order to graduate with a degree from Carleton, students must take classes in a first year Argument & Inquiry Seminar, a writing course, three quantitative reasoning encounters, language, international studies, intercultural domestic studies, humanistic inquiry, literary/artistic inquiry, arts practice, natural science, formal or statistical reasoning, social inquiry, and physical education. The average class size at Carleton is 17, in which 22.3% of all classes have 2-9 students, 48.6% have 10-19 students, and 19.8% have over 20-29 students, and 9.3% have 30+ students. The most popular areas of study are biology, political science & international relations, economics, chemistry, psychology, English, and computer science, respectively. Admission to Carleton has been deemed "most selective" by U.S. News & World Report with the most recent incoming class of 2019 admitting 20.6% of applicants, making the institution the most selective in Minnesota. For the Class of 2019 (enrolled fall 2015), 211 of the 689 early decision applicants were accepted (30.6%) and 1,177 of the 6,033 regular decision applicants were accepted (19.5%).  A spot on the waitlist was offered to 1,350 applicants, of whom 442 accepted and 16 were ultimately admitted (3.6%). Enrolling freshmen numbered 491, making the yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who enroll) 37.0%. Of the 224 who applied for transfer admission, 14 were admitted (6.3%), and 3 enrolled. Carleton has a strong history of enrolling students who are in the National Merit Scholarship Program, often enrolling more than any other liberal arts college in the nation. Its Class of 2016 included 79 National Merit Scholars. Carleton consistently ranks high among liberal arts colleges in the nation, ranking as high as 3rd in 1988 by the U.S. News & World Report.  They have also ranked Carleton in the top 10 for 25 years since its inception and in the top 5 for 9 of those years, with its 2016 ranking placing it 8th. The 2016 U.S. News & World Report high school counselor rankings place Carleton tied for 13th place among liberal arts colleges In 2014, Washington Monthly rankings — using criteria of social mobility, research, and service — ranked Carleton 2nd best college in the liberal arts college category. In the 2015 Forbes magazine ranking of American colleges, which combines liberal arts colleges and national research universities, the college is ranked 30th. Business Insider ranked Carleton as the 7th smartest liberal arts college based on SAT scores and 26th smartest college overall in 2014.[ ] Kiplinger's Personal Finance places Carleton at 12th in its 2014 ranking of best value liberal arts colleges in the "United States. Carleton was ranked 5th in the 2015 Brookings Institution's list of "Four-Year or Higher Colleges With the Highest Value-Added With Respect to Mid-Career Earnings", with Carleton adding an estimated 43% in value, raising the predicted mid-career salary of $76,236 to $117,700.[ ] In a 2012 study of higher education institutions, Carleton was listed as the number one peer institution among liberal arts colleges, followed by Oberlin and Bowdoin, as well as number one overall followed by Princeton. Carleton College is part of the Annapolis Group, which has issued a group statement asking members not to participate in ranking surveys. President Emeritus Robert Oden stated in 2007, "We commit not to mention 'U.S. News' or similar rankings in any of our new publications, since such lists mislead the public into thinking that the complexities of American higher education can be reduced to one number."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/president/speeches/?story_id=326823 |title=President's Letter About College Rankings |accessdate=2008-09-19 |last=Oden |first=Robert |date=2007-09-07 |publisher=Carleton College }}</ref>  The school also responded to a 2003 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' ranking of 50 undergraduate institutions who are "feeder schools" to 15 elite MBA, law, and medical schools, in which Carleton did not rank.  Carleton issued a statement asserting that the school's "emphasis is not on sending students specifically to elite graduate schools.

The tradition dates back to 1956, when two students absconded with the bust from Scoville Library during the process of vacating books from there to the new library. "Schiller" resided in their dorm rooms for a period, only to have the bust taken from them in turn. Possession of the bust escalated into an elaborate competition, which took on a high degree of secrecy and strategy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Schiller's public appearances, accompanied with a cry of "Schiller!", are a tacit challenge to other students to try to capture the bust.  The currently circulating bust of Schiller was retrieved from [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]] in the summer of 2003. In 2006, students created an online scavenger hunt, made up of a series of complex riddles about Carleton,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wehaveschiller.com |title=Homepage |author= |work= |publisher=Wehaveschiller.com |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070927205800/http://www.wehaveschiller.com/ |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> which led participants to Schiller's hidden location.

The Library was built in 1956 in a similar style, but was expanded in a brick-based style in the mid 1980s.  It was renamed the Gould Memorial Library in 1995 for former President [[Laurence McKinley Gould|Larry Gould]].

Cowling. As the college was having difficult financial times, it was first called "Cowling's Folly" but later became his legacy. After Carleton Farm was closed, its acreage was added to the Arboretum.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Since 1970 acreage has been removed from cultivation in sections. The Arboretum has approximately {{convert|880|acre|ha}} of restored and remnant forest, Cannon River [[floodplain]], bur oak (''Quercus macrocarpa'') [[savannah]], and [[tallgrass prairie]]. The Arboretum is divided by Minnesota Highway 19 into the larger Lower Arb to the north (so called because it includes the Cannon River valley) and the smaller Upper Arb. Pedestrian trails are located throughout the Arb, as well as the school's cross-country running and skiing courses, and a paved mixed-use bicycle/running trail in the Upper Arb.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}  ===Sustainability=== In October 2007, the Sustainable Endowments Institute, a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] organization, recognized Carleton as a leader in overall college sustainability.
