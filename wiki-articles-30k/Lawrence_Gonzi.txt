 Lawrence Gonzi, , (born July 1, 1953) is a Maltese statesman, retired Nationalist politician and lawyer, who served for twenty-five years in various critical roles in Maltese politics.  Gonzi was Prime Minister of Malta from 2004 to 2013, and leader of the Nationalist Party. He also served as speaker of the House from 1988 to 1996, and Minister of Social Policy from 1998 to 2004, as well as Deputy Prime Minister from 1999 to 2004. He served in practically all positions in Parliament, being also Leader of the House, an MP and Leader of the Opposition. Taking over as Prime Minister from Eddie Fenech Adami, Lawrence Gonzi led the islands through the delicate first years of EU membership. He piloted crucial economic and political reforms, spearheaded Malta's adoption of the euro, and the entry into force of the Schengen agreement. Gonzi is viewed chiefly responsible for Malta’s swift progress in the EU. His decision to privatise the Malta shipyards, and the pensions reform, proved to be unpopular. Following a razor-thin electoral victory in 2008, perceptions of arrogance in his cabinet, fomented by the Labour Party opposition and rebel backbenchers, dented his second term of office. Following the loss of a financial vote, his government lost supply in December 2012. The Nationalist party went on to lose the successive general election, leading to Gonzi's resignation and eventual retirement from politics. Gonzi stressed the need to ensure sustainable development and environmental stewardship on the islands, also focusing on strengthening the education and healthcare sectors. In international diplomacy, Gonzi was lauded for his role in the Libyan Revolution, breaking Malta's long relationship with the [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi regime]], and siding with the rebels. He was also highly regarded by EU leaders who worked by his side during his nine years as prime minister.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2012-11-15/news/lawrence-gonzi-an-exemplary-eu-leader-greek-pm-says-392527874/|title = Lawrence Gonzi an exemplary EU leader, Greek PM says|last = Barry|first = Duncan|date = 2012-11-15|work = The Malta Independent|accessdate = 2014-07-23}}</ref>  == Family and early life == Lawrence Gonzi was born on July 1, 1953, in [[Valletta]], Malta, the son of Luigi Gonzi and Ines Gonzi (née Galea).
