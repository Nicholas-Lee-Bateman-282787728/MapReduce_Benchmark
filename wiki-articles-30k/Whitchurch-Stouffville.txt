    Whitchurch–Stouffville  (2011 population 37,628; 2015 est.: 46,385Statistics Canada, 2011 Census Profile, Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville; Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, "Business Plan, Operating and Capital Budgets 2015 Draft," Jan. 20, 2015, p. 15.) is a  municipality in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, Canada, approximately 50 kilometres north of downtown Toronto, and 55 kilometres north-east of Toronto Pearson International Airport. It is 206.41 square kilometres in size, and located in the mid-eastern area of the Regional Municipality of York on the ecologically sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine. Its motto since 1993 is "country close to the city".Tracy Kibble, "Sell Stouffville in '93: EDAC," 'Stouffville Tribune', Jan. 27, 1993, p. 3. The Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville consists of several distinct communities and the intermediary countryside. The largest urban area is the community of Stouffville proper (2011 pop. 24,866), while other communities in the larger town include Ballantrae, Bethesda, Bloomington, Cedar Valley, Gormley, Lemonville, Lincolnville, Musselman's Lake, Pine Orchard, Pleasantville, Preston Lake, Ringwood, Vandorf, Vivian, and Wesley Corners.Cf. Boundary Map, Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, official website. For a detailed history of these unique communities, see Jean Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township (Erin, ON: Boston Mills, 1993). The town is bounded by Davis Drive (York Regional Road 31) in the north, York-Durham Line (York Regional Road 30) in the east, and Highway 404 in the west. The southern boundary conforms with a position approximately 200 metres north of 19th Avenue (York Regional Road 29), and is irregular due to the annexation of lands formerly part of Markham Township in 1971.A Brief History of Whitchurch-Stouffville, Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville. Between 2006 and 2011, the town grew 54.3%, making it the third fastest growing municipality in Canada.Statistics Canada, 2011 Census Profile, Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville; in 2006/07 the Region projected a population of 38,000 for 2021, which however was reached in 2011 (cf. York Regional Transit, "VIVA NEXT," (2006/07), Table 4.1). Over a decade, the number of private dwellings jumped 78% from 7,642 in 2001, to 13,614 in 2011, with an average of 2.76 people per private dwelling.Compare Statistics Canada, 2001 Census community highlights for Whitchurch-Stouffville., with Census Profile 2011, Whitchurch-Stouffville, Ontario." The town projects a total population of 46,385 by mid-year 2015; 55,800 by 2021, and 60,600 in 2031, with 97% of the growth within the urban boundaries of the Community of Stouffville.Cf. Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, Growth Strategy Management Strategy. Future growth is governed provincially by the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act (2001), the Greenbelt Protection Act (2005) and the Places to Grow Act (2005).Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Oak Ridges Morain Conservation Plan; Greenbelt Protection; Ontario Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, Places to Grow Act, 2005. The intent of these statutes is to prevent urban sprawl on environmentally sensitive land and to accommodate future growth in approved settlement areas only. Consequently, Whitchurch–Stouffville's future growth is planned as "sustainable development", largely within the boundaries of urban Stouffville alone, which reflects the vision of "small town tradition between the country and the city".Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, Growth Management Strategy; also York Region Official Plan, Map: Environmentally Significant Areas and Life Science Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest (December 2009). The oldest human artifacts found in Whitchurch Township date back to 1500 BC and were found in the hamlet of Ringwood (now part of urban Stouffville).Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 118f.; for a very descriptive account of ancient native burial grounds in Whitchurch Township written in 188, cf. C. Mulvany et al., History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario (Toronto: C. Blackett Robinson, 1885), 148–151.  Prior to the arrival of Europeans, two Native trails crossed through what is today Whitchurch–Stouffville. The Vandorf Trail ran from the source waters of the Rouge River to Newmarket, across the heights of the hamlet of Vandorf, and the Rouge Trail ran along the Rouge River and northwest from Musselman Lake; both were part of the aboriginal and Coureur des bois trail system leading through dense forests from Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe.Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, ch. 1, pp. 9ff., 18. Cf. also C.P. Mulvany, et al., Whitchurch, History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario (Toronto: C.B. Robinson, 1885), 148ff.; cf. 1718 map by [Guillaume de L'Isle], , with trail from Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe clearly indicated. The territory was the site of several Native villages, including Iroquois settlements around Preston Lake,Cf. A Brief History of Preston LakePride and Preston Lake website). Vandorf,Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 124f. and Musselman Lake.The Community of Musselman's Lake: A Little History, Musselman's Lake Residents Association (MLRA) official website. In 2003, a large 16th-century Huron village was discovered in Stouffville during land development; approximately 2000 people once inhabited the site (Mantle Site), which included a palisade and more than 70 longhouses, yielding tens of thousands of artifacts.Archeological Services, Inc., Mantle Site; Jennifer Birch, Coalescent Communities Iroquoian Ontario, PhD Dissertation, Dept. of Anthropology, McMaster University, 2010; Toronto Museum Project, Dunsmere Pipe; also Minutes, Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville Council, Huron Ancestral Village Resolution (C10-C0 & R00), June 17, 2007. In 2012, archaeologists revealed that a European forged-iron axehead was discovered at the site--"the earliest European piece of iron ever found in the North American interior.""Curse of the Axe on History," Northernstars.ca, the Canadian Movie Database, July 6, 2012; also Patrick Cain, "Vanished Huron village in Whitchurch-Stouffville held baffling mystery," Global News, July 6, 2012. Other significant late precontact Huron village sites have been located to the south-east (the Draper Site on the Pickering Airport lands) and to the north-west of urban Stouffville (the Ratcliff or Baker Hill Site on Ontario Highway 48, and the Old Fort or Aurora Site on Kennedy Road).See List of archaeological sites in Whitchurch–Stouffville. The western end of Whitchurch and Markham Townships was purchased by the British crown from the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation in 1787 as part of the Toronto Purchase. Whitchurch Township was created in 1792 as one of ten townships in York County. It was named in honour of the village of Whitchurch, Herefordshire in England, where Elizabeth Simcoe (wife of Upper Canada Lieutenant Governor Sir John Graves Simcoe), was born. The first European settlements in Whitchurch Township were established in the 1790s, though Whitchurch and large areas of southern Ontario were only ceded by the south-Central Ontario Mississaugas in 1923.Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, The Williams Treaties, 1923. Between 1800 and 1802, John Stegman completed a survey of the township which created a system of land concessions. This allowed for the organized distribution of land to settlers, with each concession containing five,  lots. This layout remains visible today, as the road network in the area reflects the locations of the boundaries between concession blocks.Cf. Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 14. Early settlers of this period included QuakersWm. H. Smith, Whitchurch, Canadian Gazetteer (Toronto: Roswell, 1849), 212. and Mennonites—two pacifist groups from the nearby American states of Pennsylvania, Vermont and New York. Both groups were seeking religious freedom, and were identified by the Upper Canadian government as people with necessary skills and abilities for establishing viable communities that could, in turn, attract others to settle in the region.Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 14. Mercenary German Hessian soldiers, like Stegman, were also granted land in Upper Canada by Britain in exchange for their service in the American Revolution against the 13 Colonies.  Many of the first settlements in Whitchurch Township were developed at the intersections of main roads throughout the township and /or near streams where mills could built to process the timber cleared from the land.See Barkey, et al., Whitchurch Township, 19f. Stoufferville was one such hamlet that grew around the saw and grist mills of Abraham Stouffer, a Mennonite who with his wife Elizabeth Reesor Stouffer came from Chambersburg, Pennsylvania in 1804, and acquired  of land.History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario, vol. 2 (1885), 462. Elizabeth's brother Peter Reesor established what is today Markham, first called Reesorville. Fifty-five more families from Pennsylvania, mostly Mennonite, arrived in Stoufferville in the next few years.For a detailed account, see Jean Barkey, Stouffville, 1877–1977: A Pictorial History of a Prosperous Ontario Community (Stouffville, ON: Stouffville Historical Committee, 1977), 2ff. Stouffer's sawmill was in operation by 1817 on Duffin's Creek on the Whitchurch side of Main St., and by 1825 he had a gristmill across the street on the Markham Township side of Main St. as well.(Whitchurch Township, 34; also Isabel Champion, ed., Markham: 1793–1900 (Markham, ON: Markham Historical Society, 1979), 289–296. For a detailed description of pioneer life, cf. L. Henry and G.C. Paterson, Pioneer Days in Ontario (Toronto: Ryerson, 1938). In the early 1830s, the old Stouffville Road was carved through largely virgin forest to connect York (Toronto) with Brock Township;Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 18. a post office was opened in 1832 and the name Stouffville was standardized.Whitchurch-Stouffville Public Library, Stouffville Walking Tour No. 1. In 1839, a new resident from England noted that Stouffville still had "no church (other than the Mennonite Meeting House in neighbouring Altona), baker, or butcher," though "saddlebag [Methodist circuit] preachers sometimes arrived and held meetings at the schoolhouse."Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 96. Nonetheless, Stouffville was considered a centre "of Radical opinion," one of the "hotbeds of revolution," and it was here that William Lyon Mackenzie set forth his plan for the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837–38.[C. Fothergill, ed., Mackenzie's Own Narrative of the Late Rebellion (Ottawa: Golden Dog, 1980), 5; J.C. Dent, The Story of the Upper Canada Rebellion, vol. 2 (Toronto: 1885), 218; D.B. Read, The Canadian rebellion of 1837 (Toronto, 1896), 293. The hamlet of Stouffville grew rapidly in the 1840s, and by 1849, it had "one physician and surgeon, two stores, two taverns, one blacksmith, one waggon maker, one oatmeal mill, one tailor, one shoemaker."Stouffville, Canadian Gazetteer (Toronto: Roswell, 1849), 177. The population reached 350 in 1851, 600 in 1866, and 866 in 1881, with a diversity of Mennonite, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopal, Baptist and Congregational places of worship.Cf. Barkey et al., Appendix A: Churches, Whitchurch-Township, 126ff. Also C.P. Mulvany, et al., Stouffville, History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario (Toronto: C.B. Robinson, 1885), 202. Mulvany (p. 152) notes that Whitchurch Township, without the Village of Stouffville, had a population of 4,529 in 1881. Cf. also The Ecclesiastical Gazette, (London, 1869), 318;The Congregational Quarterly, Vol. 11 (1869):140; A Historical and Statistical Report of the Presbyterian Church of Canada (Montreal, 1866), 36; Altona Mennonite Meetinghouse (Stouffville), Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online; see esp. Barkey, Stouffville, 1877–1977, 138–151, 7. In 1869 Ballantrae had a population of 75, Bloomington 50, Gormley 80, Lemonville 75, and Ringwood 100.McEvoy, The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory, 1869. In 1876, there was a regular stage coach connection from the hamlet of Stouffville to Ringwood, Ballantrae, Lemonville, Glasgow, Altona and Claremont.J. A. Crawford, Gazetteer and Directory of the County of Ontario, for the year 1876 (Uxbridge, ON: 1876), 14. In 1877, Stouffville became an incorporated village.Cf. the detailed 1878 maps, Township of Markham; Township of Whitchurch, Illustrated historical atlas of the county of York and the township of West Gwillimbury & town of Bradford in the county of Simcoe, Ont. (Toronto : Miles & Co., 1878); also Stouffville Map (1880). Stouffville's growth was aided by the establishment of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway, built in 1871, which connected Stouffville and Uxbridge with Toronto. In 1877, a second track was built north to Jackson's Point on Lake Simcoe. These connections were created in large part to provide a reliable and efficient means of transporting timber harvested and milled in these regions. Soon Stouffville Junction serviced thirty trains per day.Barkey, Stouffville, 1877–1977, 19. During this time of prosperity, Stouffville businessman R.J. Daley built a large music hall, roller-skating rink, and curling rink.History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario, vol. 2 (1885), 453. In 1911 Stouffville had a public library, two banks, two newspapers, as well as telephone and telegraph connections. Intensive forestry in Whitchurch Township led to large-scale deforestation, eroding the thinner soils of northern Whitchurch into sand deserts; by 1850 Whitchurch Township was only 35 percent wooded, and that was reduced to 7 percent by 1910.Cf. Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 18–19, 21; 28f. The Lake Simcoe Junction Railway Line was consequently abandoned in 1927.Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 92. Reforestation efforts were begun locally, and with the passage of the Reforestation Act (1911), the process of reclaiming these areas began. Vivian Forest, a large conservation area in northern Whitchurch–Stouffville, was established in 1924 for this purpose. This development has helped to restore the water-holding capacity of the soil and to reduce the cycles of flash spring floods and summer drought. In 2008, the town had more than 62²km of protected forest;Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, Annual Report 2008, 6. the forest is considered one of the most successful restorations of a degraded landscape in North America.York Regional Forest, York Region official website. Yet similar environmental consequences due to increased urbanization were projected in 2007 by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority as probable for southern Whitchurch–Stouffville (headwaters of the Rouge River watershed) if targeted plantings in this area did not begin quickly.Toronto and Area Conservation Authority, Rouge River Watershed Plan (2007), 64, 78. Already in 1993, the Whitchurch Historical Committee warned a new generation of "Whitchurch-Stouffville residents" to be "vigilant to treat trees and forests with respect&nbsp;... In the 1990s care must be taken so that urbanization and concrete road-building do not repeat the destruction to our forest heritage."Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 33; see also 30f.  Though growth in the hamlets of Whitchurch–Stouffville was stagnant after the demise of the forest industry, the population began to grow again in the 1970s, with development in Metropolitan Toronto and the consequent arrival of new commuters. These developments led to a reexamination at the provincial level of municipal governance. On January 1, 1971, Whitchurch Township and the Village of Stouffville were merged to create the Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville; the combined population was 11,487. The town's southern boundary was also moved four farm lots south of the original southern boundary of Main Street. This land was formerly a part of Markham Township.Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 99. Whitchurch–Stouffville adopted its coat of arms in 1973 (see information box right). The dove of peace, the original seal of Whitchurch Township, is at the crest, recalling the pacifist Quaker and Mennonite settlers who founded many of the town's communities, including Stouffville. The British Union banner of 1707 pays tribute to the United Empire Loyalists. The white church symbolizes Whitchurch, and the star and chalice come from the Stouffer family (Swiss) coat of arms.Cf. Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 99. The growth of Toronto brought serious ecological problems to Whitchurch–Stouffville. Between 1962 and 1969, hundreds of thousands of litres per month of sulfuric acid, calcium hydroxide, and oil waste were poured into unlined Whitchurch–Stouffville dumps never designed as landfill sites and situated directly above the town's main aquifer. This was followed by years of solid waste from Toronto (1,100 tons per day in 1982). In the early 1980s, a group initially named "Concerned Mothers" found that the miscarriage rate in Whitchurch–Stouffville was 26% compared to the provincial average of 15%, and that the town had a high rate of cancer and birth defects.New Scientist, Birth Defects Mystery (July 18, 1981), 137; The Sorry Saga of Stouffville's Polluted Water (Mar 18, 1982), 700; Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Proceedings, April 6, 1982; H. Rosenberg, The Kitchen and the Multinational Corporation: An analysis of the links between the household and global corporations, Journal of Business Ethics 6 (1987), 179f.; Globe and Mail (May 12, 1982). Though the Ministry of Environment was satisfied that the wells tested in 1974 and 1981 had negligible levels of cancer causing agents (mutagens), the town opposed the expansion of the "York Sanitation Site #4". Only after much grass-roots advocacy at the provincial level was the site ordered to close on June 30, 1983.Cf. Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Proceedings, (April 6, 1982); Proceedings (January 18, 1983). The garbage disposal company made a substantial donation to the governing Progressive Conservative party in 1974 as it was seeking disposal permits (cf. John Swaigan, How to Fight for What's Right (James Lorimer & Company, 1981), 8f.). In 1984 it was reported in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario that PCBs were found in well-water, and that 27,000 gallons of contaminated leachate per day were leaking from the site, threatening ground water quality.Cf. Ministry of the Environment, Whitchurch-Stouffville Mutagenicity Study: Final Report (1982), 46–47; also the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Proceedings: Stouffville Dump (June 18, 1984). With new commuter rail service on the Stouffville Line in the 1990s, the drilling of two deep aquifer wells to secure safer water for a large, new development in the hamlet of BallantraeWarren Smith, Ballantrae Golf and Country Club – Not always thus .... Between 2001 and 2006, Ballantrae's population mushroomed from a population 295 to 1,278 people (Statistics Canada, Population and dwelling counts, for urban areas, 2006 and 2001).  in 1996, and the controversial expansion of the York-Durham Sewage System Big Pipe with additional water capacity from Lake Ontario, Whitchurch–Stouffville began a major self-transformation.York Region, Water and Wastewater Masterplan (November 2009); Amendment 6 to the Official Plan for the Regional Municipality of York (1998). Not unlike the late 19th century, responsible land and water stewardship, as well as the positive integration of many new residents annually into the community, define the challenges and opportunities for Whitchurch–Stouffville in the years to come. The most significant challenge facing Whitchurch–Stouffville in the coming years, however, is the federal government's proposed development of an international airport immediately south-east of Whitchurch–Stouffville (the Pickering Airport lands). Under the current plan, approaches for two of the three landing strips would be directly above Whitchurch–Stouffville communities: the first over Ballantrae, Musselman's Lake and the north-east corner of urban Stouffville, with planes descending (or ascending) from 535 to 365 metres (with an allowable building height in Stouffville of 43 metres); the second over Gormley and the Dickson Hill area (near the Walmart and Smart Centre).Cf. Transport Canada, Press Release, June 11, 2013; Plan Showing Pickering Airport Site; also Greater Toronto Airports Authority, Pickering Airport Draft Plan Report, 6.3. By comparison, Toronto Pearson International Airport had 32.3 million passengers in 2008, with an average of 1,179 "aircraft movements" per day (GTTA, Toronto Pearson Fast Facts. A "Needs Assessment Study" was completed by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority for the federal government in May 2010. After a "due diligence review," Transport Canada released the report in July 2011, which identified the most likely time range for the need of the airport to be 2027–2029, and confirmed the site layout proposed in the 2004 Draft Plan Report.See GTAA, "Needs Assessment Study Pickering Lands: Final Report," March 2011, fig. 12.1 & par. 12.4.3; also Transport Canada, News Release: "Transport Canada releases findings of the 2010 Pickering Lands Needs Assessment Study," July 11, 2011; S. Bolan, "Stouffville politicians mixed over airport plan," Stouffville Sun-Tribune, July 13, 2011. Whitchurch–Stouffville is governed by a mayor and six councillors, with one councillor representing each of the six municipal wards. The original ward boundaries created with amalgamation in 1971, and were amended in 2009 for the 2010 municipal elections.M. Kennedy (Town Clerk) and Robert J. Williams, Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville Electoral Ward Review Policy: Final Report, May 2009. The Mayor of Whitchurch–Stouffville represents the town on the York Regional Council. On October 27, 2014, Justin Altmann was elected Mayor of Whitchurch–Stouffville.S. Bolan, Justin Altmann sick from nerves while watching polls, Stouffville Sun-Tribune, Oct. 27, 2014. Two York Region District School Board trustees are elected to represent Whitchurch–Stouffville and East Gwillimbury (one English language and one French), as well as two trustees for the York Catholic District School Board (one English language and one French).School Board Trustee Information, Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville official website. School board trustees are elected at the same time, and on the same ballot, as the mayor and city councillors. In 2008, 94.4% of Whitchurch–Stouffville residents were either satisfied or very satisfied with the overall quality of life in the Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville. In a major community survey, close to 30% of the respondents described the town as fine, good, nice, great, or pleasant; more than half of the respondents like the community or small town feel, while 46.3% enjoyed the friendly neighbourhoods.DPRA Canada, Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville Community Satisfaction Survey (May 27, 2008), 7f. The most important municipal issues indicated by residents in 2008 were the need to improve the road system; traffic issues; increasing urbanization and overcrowding; land use development and sprawl; and the cost of living (including taxes and user fees) in the town.DPRA Canada, Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville Media Release, Community Satisfaction Survey, (June 3, 2008), 8. Environmental protection, including environmental assessments for new development and natural preservation measures, was identified as matter of high importance by residents, but low on a scale of satisfaction. In the hamlet of Musselman's Lake, 72% of residents in 2009 were concerned about the environmental health of the lake and the surrounding community.Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority/ Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, Musselman's Lake Subwatershed: Assessment and Stewardship Opportunities Report (2009), 115–117. All municipalities in York Region except Whitchurch–Stouffville have an active Environmental Advisory Committee; the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville dismantled its committee after the municipal elections in 2006.Derek Sawyer, Letter to the Editor, Environment committee could have been council's tree-cutting watch dog, Stouffville Sun-Tribune (August 29, 2007); cf. the complete list of committees, Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, Committees and Appointees, official website. In August 2011, the municipal offices were moved into a business park area at 111 Sandiford Drive in Stouffville.S. Bolan, "Customer King at New Stouffville Town Hall," Stouffville Sun-Tribune, June 16, 2011. At the provincial level Whitchurch–Stouffville is in the Oak Ridges—Markham riding. Since 2007 this riding has been represented at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by Helena Jaczek, a member of the governing Ontario Liberal Party. In 2015, the creation of the new provincial riding of Markham—Stouffville (provincial electoral district) was announced, effective for the 42nd provincial election scheduled for June 2018. The new riding will include all of Whitchurch–Stouffville.CBC News, Changes to Ontario elections include new ridings, spring fixed date, June 4, 2015. At the federal level Whitchurch–Stouffville is in the riding of Markham—Stouffville. Since the federal election of October 2015, the riding has been represented by The Honourable Jane Philpott, Minister of Health and member of the governing Liberal Party of Canada.Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission of Ontario, Markham—Stouffville – Commission's Report, 2013. The greatest portion of Whitchurch–Stouffville lies on the Oak Ridges Moraine.Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Land Use Planning: The Oak Ridges Moraine (Map). The moraine consists of knobby hills between 290 to 373 meters above sea level of irregularly bedded layers of unconsolidated sand and gravel (built-up glacial debris) deposited by the meltwater of the Wisconsin glacier some twenty-five thousand to ten thousand years ago.For the following, see Barkey, et al., Whitchurch Township, ch. 6. In a few cases the retreating glacier left behind and buried huge blocks of ice which, when melted, created deep, water-filled depressions known as kettle lakes. Preston Lake, Van Nostrand Lake and Musselman Lake are three such examples. The boundaries of Whitchurch–Stouffville contain a watershed divide. Streams and rivers at the top of the Oak Ridges Moraine flow northward into the Lake Simcoe basin, part of the Lake Huron watershed. The southern sections (south of Bloomington Road) make up the headwaters of the Rouge River and Duffins Creek, both of which flow into the Lake Ontario basin.York Region, Official Plan: Oak Ridges Moraine Aquifer Vulnerability Areas and Watershed Boundaries, Map 7. These headwaters include many smaller streams and creeks throughout southern Whitchurch–Stouffville. Their identification and protection, plus reforestation in these area, has been identified as urgent for rebuilding water-capacity in the Rouge River watershed which can off-set the worst environmental impacts (e.g., flash flooding, erosion and ground water contamination) of rapid urbanization.Cf. Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, Rouge River Watershed Plan Report: Towards a Healthy and Sustainable Future (2007); Rouge River State of the Watershed Report: Study Area and Physical Setting (2007). The heavily wooded Vivian Infiltration Area is an environmentally significant hydrological infiltration area that contributes groundwater to the Oak Ridges aquifer complex. The northwestern corner of Whitchurch–Stouffville is outside the moraine and is part of the Schomberg Lake plain, an ancient lake-bed overlain by silts and fine sands. The soil formed over the former lake-bed is well-drained, arable farmland. The southernmost portion of Whitchurch–Stouffville west of Highway 48 lies below the moraine and is a clay-loam till plain. Tree species native to Whitchurch–Stouffville include: American Mountain Ash, Balsam Fir, Bitternut Hickory, Black Cherry, Black Spruce, Bur Oak, Eastern Hemlock, Eastern White Cedar, Peachleaf Willow, Pin Cherry, Red Oak, Red Maple, Red Pine, Shagbark Hickory, Silver Maple, Sugar Maple, Tamarack, Trembling Aspen, White Birch, White Oak, White Pine and White Spruce.For more detail, see Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Ontario Tree Atlas: Ecodistrict 6E-7. In 2012, Whitchurch–Stouffville's forest cover was 28.9%.York Region, 2013 Greening Strategy Achievements, Table 2, p. 5; for an exhaustive list of flora and fauna in the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, see: Community of Stouffville Secondary Plan Amendment, Phase 3 Land. Natural Environment Background Report, Appendix II: Wildlife Species Lists, November 2013. Whitchurch–Stouffville's water supply system is both groundwater-based with five municipal wells and since 2009 lake-based (Lake Ontario) as well. 5,500 cubic metres of water are withdrawn from the Oak Ridges Aquifer and the Thorncliffe Aquifer daily. Stouffville's well-water is chlorinated for disinfection, and sodium silicate is added to keep iron from staining plumbing fixtures and laundry. Two wells receive additional disinfection through an ultraviolet (UV) system. Three groundwater wells are in close proximity to the settlement area of Stouffville (Main Street, east of 10th Line); consequently 239 "significant drinking water threats" have been identified.Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, CTC Source Protection Region: Updated Assessment Report – Toronto and Region Source Protection, Vol. 1, Report, pp. 2–29; 4–26; Fig. 4.21, 4.22, 4.23; Table 5.6; 5.12; Fig. 5.24, 5.25. See also: Vol. 2, Appendixes, July 2011. Whitchurch–Stouffville has a continental climate moderated by the Great Lakes and influenced by warm, moist air masses from the south, and cold, dry air from the north. The Oak Ridges Moraine affects levels of precipitation: as air masses arrive from Lake Ontario and reach the elevated ground surface of the moraine, they rise causing precipitation.Cf. Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, Rouge River Watershed Plan Report (2007), 15. Because of increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources estimates a 1–2 degree increase both in summer and winter average temperatures in the region between 2011 and 2040, and a 0% to 10% decrease in precipitation (compared to averages between 1970 and 2000).Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Climate Change in Ontario: Interactive Map. Smog producing ground-level ozone is a problem affecting the entire Greater Toronto Area. A major pathway for airborne pollutants flows from the upper Midwest United States and the Ohio River Valley and across southern Ontario and Toronto; key sources are coal-burning power-plants and vehicle engines. On episode days (O3 > 82 ppb), Whitchurch–Stouffville reaches its peak about one to two hours later than Toronto.Secretariat of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, Long-Range Transport of Ground-Level Ozone and Its Precursors (Montreal, 1997), 20; eight-hour exposure to ozone concentrations of 85 to 104 ppb are described as "unhealthy" for sensitive groups. Smog Advisory Alerts are issued by the Ministry of the Environment when smog conditions are expected to reach the poor category in Ontario. The Greater Toronto Area had 13 smog days in 2008, 29 in 2007, 11 in 2006, 48 in 2005.Jasmeet Sidhu, GTA gets year's first smog advisory, Toronto Star, May 21, 2009.

Motor traffic is served primarily by Ontario provincial Highway 48, Highway 407, and Highway 404, which are in turn complemented by a network of regional roads that form a grid pattern across the town. In 1994, a plan to connect urban Stouffville directly to Highway 401 via the proposed East Metro Freeway was canceled in large part due to the concerns of residents and the work of the Rouge River activist groups. Whitchurch–Stouffville is traversed by two railway lines: One is Canadian National Railway's primary freight corridor connecting Greater Toronto to Northern Ontario and Western Canada, which is being considered for future GO Transit train service with stations in the communities of Vandorf and Gormley (West).Cf. GO Transit Richmond Hill Line Notification Letters, 2009. The other railway line, formerly the Toronto and Nipissing Railway, is now owned by GO Transit and hosts Stouffville line passenger service to and from Toronto. This line includes two stations in Whitchurch–Stouffville: the Stouffville GO Station in urban Stouffville, and the line's terminus, Lincolnville GO Station, located to Stouffville's northeast. The York-Durham Heritage Railway also runs historical trains between the station and Uxbridge on summer weekends.York-Durham Heritage Railroad, official website. Until 2012, York Region Transit (YRT) operated two routes (9 and 15) within urban Stouffville, with connection to the Markham-Stouffville Hospital and other Markham routes. With the 2012 York Region Transit Service Plan, the two routes were merged, and the frequency of direct buses to the hospital YRT transit hub was reduced.Cf. the YRT's maps and the York Region Transit-Viva Annual Service Plan 2012, slide 30 of 38. For the history and ridership of these routes, see the Canadian Public Transit Discussion Board, Route 9 and Route 15; also see York Region's Moving on Sustainability Transportation Master Plan Update, Main Report (Nov. 2009). In February 2014, a new Route 15 was introduced, connecting Stouffville to Yonge Street in Richmond Hill and to a future GO-Station in Gormley.See S. Bolan, "Get on board Stouffville-Yonge St. YRT route next month," Stouffville Sun-Tribune, Jan. 8, 2014; also: Newsroom—Province of Ontario, "Commuter train and bus station to be completed by end of 2016," Dec. 1, 2014.

Sandra Bolan, "Stouffville beach closed to public," Sun-Tribune, June 7, 2012; also the Musselman's Lake Residents Association website. while access to Preston Lake was lost when Landford Development purchased the west-shore beach and trailer park and built estate properties with a shared private beach. In 2008 the town's development plans included a trail system with access to Preston Lake, but this was met with opposition from Preston Lake residents who desired to protect their exclusive access. Interest and support for the purchase or expropriation of land for public access to the town's most important natural and recreational assests has grown with the town's development.The Vandorf-Preston Lake Secondary plan which proposed a trail system that would give public access to the lake met with opposition; cf.

Whitchurch–Stouffville's investment in the arts has been slow, and consequently residents have not only fallen below the national average on exposure to the performing arts, museums and galleries, but the average exposure has decreased from 2006 to 2010. Whitchurch–Stouffville's deficit in the performing arts has been addressed in part by the recent rehabilitation of the former Stouffville Town Hall (constructed in 1896), a redevelopment that created a multifaceted arts, culture and entertainment centre in downtown Stouffville; The Lebovic Centre for Arts & Entertainment – Nineteen on the Park opened its doors to the public in May 2009.The Lebovic Centre for Arts & Entertainment – Nineteen on the Park, official website.
