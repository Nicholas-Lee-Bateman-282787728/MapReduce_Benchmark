What is now Freehold Borough was originally incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 25, 1869, from portions within Freehold Township. The town became independent of the township in 1888. On April 15, 1919, Freehold was incorporated as a borough, including all of Freehold and additional portions of Freehold Township, based on the results of a referendum held on July 8, 1919. Additional portions of Freehold Township were annexed on September 7, 1926.Snyder, John P.

The Lenni Lenape Native Americans were the earliest known people to live in the area that became Freehold.History, Township of Freehold. Accessed August 28, 2013.  The Lenape were a hunter-gatherer society.  They were largely sedentary, changing campsites seasonally.  They were prolific hunters of small game and birds.  They were also skilled fisherman, and were known to harvest vast amounts of clams from the bays and inlets on the Jersey Shore.  They also practiced some agriculture to augment their food supply.  During this time, an important crossroad of two major Lenape trails was located in the area of Freehold.Pepe, p. 19. In 1498, John Cabot became the first European to sight this land. The Dutch were the first to settle and develop the area.  By the 17th Century, the English had taken over the area.  In 1664, the Duke of York (later James II & VII) granted a patent to Sir George Carteret to develop the area.  In 1685, Scottish immigrants, fleeing religious persecution at home, became the first to settle the area. In 1693, Along with Middletown and Shrewsbury, Freehold was established by act of legislature as one of the three original townships in Monmouth County.Lurie, Maxine ed.; "Freehold Township", Encyclopedia of New Jersey, p. 291. Rutgers University Press; New Brunswick, NJ; 2004. Accessed August 28, 2013. ISBN 9780813533254. The name of the borough comes from the word Freehold, an English legal term describing fee simple property ownership.Gannett, Henry. The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States, p. 198. United States Government Printing Office, 1905. Accessed August 31, 2015. In 1714, when the colonial government was deciding where to locate the county seat and courthouse, Freeholder John Reid, the first Surveyor General of East Jersey, wanted the county seat located in Freehold Township.  Reid sold land suitable for use as a courthouse to the Board of Chosen Freeholders at a bargain price, and this may have been the deciding factor why Freehold was selected over Middletown and Shrewsbury. In return for the heavily discounted price, Reid placed a restrictive covenant in the deed that, should the property ever cease being used as a courthouse, ownership would revert to the Reid family. Direct descendants of John Reid still reside in Freehold Township.History of the Hall of Records, Monmouth County, New Jersey. Accessed January 28, 2008. Freehold was officially designated as the seat of the Monmouth County government, and a court house was commissioned to be built on the land purchased from John Reid.  The Monmouth Courthouse opened in 1715.Pepe, p. 10.  A small village quickly began to develop around the courthouse.  At first, the village was called Monmouth Courthouse. Over time, other government buildings opened near the courthouse, including a sheriffâ€™s office, a prison and a post office.  A number of homes and commercial businesses also sprang up in the village, including a blacksmith, a general store, a bank, a hotel, and saloon.Pepe, p. 25. In the area surrounding Monmouth Courthouse, many successful farms began to appear.  The farms in Freehold were particularly well known for the production of potatoes, beans, and rye, which were sold in the markets of nearby cities.  Freehold also became known for its excellent horse farms. The differences within Freehold between growing village around the courthouse and the surrounding farmland were the seeds for the eventually division of Freehold into two separate municipalities in the early 20th century. As of 1745, the majority of families in Freehold were still Scottish immigrants.  In modern Freehold today, many important streets bear the name of early colonial families, including Barkalow, Applegate, Rhea, Throckmorton, and Schanck.Pepe, p. 29.  Freehold was deeply impacted by the American Revolution.  By the early 1770s, the Sons of Liberty were actively recruiting local members in Freehold, and were agitating the relationship between the British government and the colonists.Adelberg, p. 15.  In 1775, immediately after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Capt. Elias Longstreet recruited the first company of Freeholders to join the Continental Army.Adelberg, p. 16.  Freehold was a known center of patriot activity.  The Declaration of Independence was publicly proclaimed, read aloud, from the steps of the Freehold Courthouse just a few days after being signed in Philadelphia. However, after British success at the Battle of Long Island, Freehold and all of Monmouth County fell under the control of Loyalists.Adelberg, p. 17.  The British government continued to operate the Freehold Courthouse, and several people involved in revolutionary activists were arrested and tried for treason at the courthouse.  The success of the Continental Army at the Battle of Trenton helped to weaken loyalist control of Freehold.Adelberg, p. 18. In June 1778, the British Army began a major strategic evacuation of the city of Philadelphia.  They attempted to protect a long, slow moving column of loyalist families, equipment, and other supplies seized in Philadelphia, as they moved towards ships in New York Harbor.  On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army intercepted the column in Freehold.Adelberg, p.20    The Battle of Monmouth was one of the largest battles of the Revolutionary War, involving over 25,000 soldiers combined in Continental, British, and Hessian forces. The Continental Army was able to repeal the British forces, and held their ground on the battlefield. However, British forces were successful in completing their primary goal, the evacuation of Philadelphia. Both sides claimed victory in the battle.  Several famous figures from the Revolutionary War fought at the Battle of Monmouth.  British forces were commanded by Sir Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis.  The Continental Army was commanded by George Washington and Charles Lee.  Charles Lee was court martialed by the Continental Army for his behavior at the Battle of Monmouth.  Nathaniel Greene, Alexander Hamilton, the Marquis de Lafayette and Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben also fought for the Continental Army at the Battle of Monmouth.Adelberg, p. 11 Another famous figure at the Battle of Monmouth was Molly Pitcher, who manned a cannon during the battle after her husband was wounded. In the aftermath of the Battle of Monmouth, Loyalist control of Freehold faltered.  The town ceased to have a functioning municipal government, and the courthouse was closed until the end of the war.  Minor clashes between loyalists and continentals flared up in town, with the violence peaking around 1780.Adelberg, p.22 Colonel Tye, an escaped slave and leader of a prominent loyalist guerilla force, conducted several raids in and around Freehold. One famous incident was the capture and hanging of Joshua Huddy by British Loyalists under the direction of Richard Lippincott. Colonel Tye was killed during the raid on Huddy's home.PBS Resource Bank. Colonel Tye", "Africans in America". Accessed October 13, 2013. "In September, 1780 Tye led a surprise attack on the home of Captain Josiah Huddy, whom Loyalists had tried to capture for years. Amazingly, Huddy and his friend Lucretia Emmons managed to hold off their attackers for two hours, until the Loyalists flushed them out by setting the house afire. During the battle, Tye was shot in the wrist, and days later, what was thought to be minor wound turned fatal when lockjaw set in." Patriots later cut down Huddy's body hanging from the gallows and buried it in Freehold, at Old Tennent Church.The Joshua Huddy era, Monmouth County. Accessed December 14, 2006.  At the end of the war, the community was deeply divided, and nearly 120 loyalist families left Freehold, fearing persecution from their neighbors.  Most of these families re-settled in Canada.Adelberg, p.23 During the early 1800s, Freehold steadily grew in size.  The village around the courthouse was now called Freehold, along with the surrounding farmland.Pepe, p. 23  In 1852, when long distance railroad systems were first being developed, a railroad station, with trains making regular stops, was built near the courthouse in Freehold.  Freehold soon had public sewers in the village and in some of the outlying farmland.  By 1883, there was an electrical grid and a telephone switchboard, at a time when these inventions were still brand new.  These public advancements caused rapid economic growth in Freehold.  The village of Freehold became an important commercial and industrial hub in central New Jersey.  The farms in the rest of Freehold benefitted greatly by being able to sell their products more easily in New York and Philadelphia.Griffith, Lee Ellen; Freehold, Arcadia Publishing; Charleston; 1996; introduction  Both the village and the farms prospered together, however the public policies sought by the two different communities continued to grow further apart.  The municipal government was increasingly divided between the villagers and farmers. In 1824, the American Hotel opened on Main Street in Freehold.  It is still standing today, and is one of the oldest buildings in Freehold.  In 1853, the Freehold Raceway opened.  Though the original grandstand burned down in a fire, the racetrack is still open today, and is one of the oldest harness racetracks in America.  The Great Fire of Freehold happened on October 30, 1873.  The fire reportedly began in a commercial building on Main Street.  It soon spread to engulf a large section of the village, and many wooden buildings, including Monmouth Courthouse, were burned down.Griffith, p.11 Freehold also has a relatively forgotten but important place in the history of the bicycle. Cycling champion Arthur Augustus Zimmerman resided in the town during his racing career in the 1880s and 1890s, and from 1896â€“1899 operated the Zimmerman Bicycle Co.; the company's bicycles were known as the "Zimmy." Today, Freehold Borough is home to the Metz Bicycle Museum, where the only extant "Zimmy" can be seen.Metzger, Dick. "Bicycle buffs have a haven at Freehold museum: Local collectorâ€™s prize possession is â€˜Zimmyâ€™ manufactured in town", East Brunswick Sentinel, July 11, 2002. Accessed May 15, 2007. "More than 100 years ago, in the late 1880s and 1890s, the village of Freehold was arguably the bicycle capital of the world." At the beginning of the 20th Century, Freehold was an increasingly divided community.  The issue of local tax dollars, used as funding for public works and infrastructure projects, was the primary point of contention.pepe; p.134  The Freeholders living in the downtown area, around the courthouse had very different ideas about how to spend public money compared to the Freeholders living in the surrounding farmland.  Tension within the community increased greatly in 1916 when a severe polio epidemic swept through Freehold.pepe; p.133  After contentious public debate, a referendum was held to on the future of Freehold, and voters overwhelmingly decided to split the town into two separate municipalities. On April 15, 1919, Freehold Borough formerly separated from Freehold Township.  Freeholders generally refer to the different municipalities simple as, the Borough and the Township.  The Borough, the downtown area around the courthouse, retained all the existing government buildings around Court Street and Main Street.  The Borough also kept the designation as county seat.Pepe; p. 135  Freehold Township, the farming communities that surrounded the courthouse, set up a new city hall complex on Schanck Road.  The Township completely encircles the Borough.  On September 7, 1926, Freehold Borough annexed additional territory from the Township. Freehold Borough initially prospered in the early 20th century.  However, by mid-century, the Borough began to decline as downtown areas across the country shrank, and suburban areas began growing.  In 1961, the A & M Karagheusian rug factory closed.Pepe; p.128  This factory had long been the largest employer in the area, and its closure had a devastating effect of economic stability of the Borough.  The Borough managed to turn around its economic decline by establishing the downtown area as a center for restaurants and nightlife.Lurie, Maxine ed.; Hamburger, Susan. "Freehold Borough" in The Encyclopedia of New Jersey, Rutgers University Press; New Brunswick, NJ; 2004; p. 290.  Several well-known local restaurants on Main Street are now crowded every night of the week. Freehold Borough was an important center of African American civil rights activity in New Jersey during the years leading up to the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1955.Greason, Walter.

Bruce Springsteen grew up in the Borough and lived on South Street. In 1963, he graduated eighth grade from St. Rose of Lima School, and graduated from Freehold Borough High School in 1967.Pepe; p.146 In 1973, he released his first album, and rocketed to international fame.  Springsteen has always remained loyal to Freehold and makes reference to it in several of his famous songs, including "My Hometown".

Freehold is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.2012 New Jersey Legislative District Data Book, Rutgers University Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, March 2013, p. 63. The Borough form of government used by Freehold, the most common system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie.

The Henry Hudson Trail runs north along an abandoned rail line to Matawan. Freehold Circle was located near the western boundary of Freehold Borough near the Freehold Raceway. The circle carried traffic between US 9, Business Route 33 and Manalapan Avenue (CR 24); it was eliminated in the 1980s due to the increased traffic load caused by a boom in commercial and residential development.
