 The Duck family is a fictional family of cartoon ducks related to Disney character Donald Duck. The family is also related to the Coot, Goose, and Gander families, as well as the Scottish Clan McDuck. Besides Donald, the most well-known members of the Duck family are Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Donald's three nephews. Members of the Duck family appear most extensively in Donald Duck comic stories (although some have made animated appearances). In 1993, American comics author Don Rosa published a Duck family tree which established each characters' relationships for purposes of his stories. Rosa even created a fictional timeline for when certain characters were born. (All birth/death dates given below are Rosa's.) Some other comics authors, both before and after Rosa's family tree, have shown variations in the family.  In the early 1950s Carl Barks was in his second decade of creating comic book stories starring Donald Duck and his various relatives. He had personally created several of the latter, Scrooge McDuck and Gladstone Gander being the most notable among them, but the exact relation between them was still somewhat uncertain. Barks decided to create a personal version of their Family tree. To better define their relations, he added several previously unknown relatives. Barks never intended to publish this family tree, as he had created it for his personal use. The first public attempt at a coherent biography of the ducks was published in 1974. An Informal Biography of Scrooge McDuck by science fiction author Jack Chalker used names and events in the Barks stories (and a very few non-Barks ones) to create a life story for McDuck. It provided the basis for a Scrooge biography included in The People's Almanac."The People Who Never Were -- Yet Live Today." The People's Almanac, edited by David Wallenchinsky and Irving Wallace. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday & C., 1975. p. 1235-1237. By 1978 the Duck family was ingrained sufficiently in popular culture that a character in the movie Corvette Summer quips "Just call me Gladstone Duck" after being lucky.Reviews & Ratings for Corvette Summer In 1981 Barks was well into his retirement but his stories remained popular and had gained him unexpected fame. He had given several interviews and answered questions about his personal views on the characters and their stories. Among other subjects, Backs described his early version of the family tree. Rough sketches of the tree were published in a number of fanzines. Fans of the characters were pleased for the background it added to them. At this point Mark Worden decided to create a drawing of this family tree including portraits of the characters mentioned. Otherwise Worden made few changes to the tree, most notably adding Daisy Duck as Donald's main love interest. His illustrated version of the tree was published at first in several fanzines and later in the Carl Barks Library. The later was a ten-volume collection of his works in hardcover black-and-white edition. In 1987 Don Rosa, a long-time fan of Carl Barks and personal friend of Mark Worden, started creating his own stories featuring Scrooge McDuck and his various associates. His stories contained numerous references to older stories by Barks as well as several original ideas. After several years he gained a fanbase of his own. In the early 1990s Egmont, the publishing house employing Don Rosa, offered him an ambitious assignment. He was to create the definitive version of Scrooge's biography and a family tree accompanying it. This was supposed to end decades of contradictions between stories which caused confusion to readers. The project was to become The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. The family tree accompanying it was first published in Norway on July 3, 1993. In the process of working on Scrooge's biography, Rosa studied Barks' old stories mentioning his past. Then he added several ideas of his own. Among them were biographical information for Scrooge's supporting cast. In a way Scrooge's biography was also their own biography. The family tree below shows the Goose (left) and Duck (right) portions of Donald's family tree according to Carl Barks. The chart is based on a 1950s sketch made by Barks for personal use, which was latter illustrated by artist Mark Worden in 1981.Mark Worden's Duck Family Tree              In 1993, Don Rosa published his version of the Duck family tree as part of his 12-part comics series The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. The most significant change was Rosa's expansion of the family tree to include the Coot relatives. Rosa also added Goostave Gander as the father of Gladstone, and made Luke Goose the father of Gus, rather than his uncle. The chart below is Rosa's tree which shows relationships within the Coot family (left) and Duck family (right).                  Pintail Duck was a 16th-century Duck relative and the first early ancestor to appear in person. Pintail served in the English Navy as the boatswain aboard the HMS Falcon Rover. The Falcon Rover raided Spanish targets in the Caribbean Sea between 1563 and 1564 when the ship was sunk. Pintail was friends with the ship's first mate, Malcolm McDuck, who was also an ancestor of Donald. Pintail appears in the story "Back to Long Ago" (1956) in which it is suggested that he was an earlier incarnation of Donald. Humperdink Duck is the earliest known modern Duck family member. He is the husband of Elvira Coot, known as "Grandma Duck", and Donald's grandfather. He worked as a farmer in Duckburg. He had three children: Quackmore, Daphne and Eider. Humperdink Duck had relevant comic appearances in two stories by Don Rosa. "The Invader Of Fort Duckburg",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story The Invader Of Fort Duckburg a chapter of the saga The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, and "The Sign Of The Triple Distelfink".Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story The Sign Of The Triple Distelfink He was known as "Pa Duck" (later known as "Grandpa Duck"). Humperdink's life before having a family was never shown in the comics. Don Rosa speculated that the Duck family originated from England, but it is unknown if Humperdink is an immigrant.Who's who in Duckburg - Humperdink "Grandpa" Duck In the story "The Good Old Daze" by Tony Strobl,Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story The Good Old Daze Grandpa Duck (an older Humperdink) appears in flashback taking care of little Donald along with Grandma. He's portrayed as a dedicated but rigorous grandfather. Grandpa's real name wasn't revealed in this story, but in an untitled one from 1951, where an old lover of Grandma called Humperdink has a cameo appearance. Don Rosa considered that this character became Donald's grandfather.Humperdink Dabney "Grandpa" Duck In this same story, Grandma remembers an occasion where she and Humperdink heard one of her favorite songs. She says to herself, "I remember the band played that for Humperdink and me at the Fish Peddler's Picnic in 1905!". Besides, Grandma finds the ruined coat Humperdink had used to let her not step on a mud puddle and some romantic letters addressed to her written by Humperdink. Then she remembers some sweet names Humperdink used to refer to her in those letters. Humperdink appeared as "Grandpa Duck" in two comic stories previously mentioned. "The Good Old Daze" by Strobl and "The Sign Of The Triple Distelfink" by Rosa, but Strobl drew him with a quite long beard and some hair, while Rosa has drawn him with a short one and a full head of hair. In a comic story first published in 2013 Grandpa Duck (Strobl's version) appears in a flashback scene which is told by his wife Grandma Duck. This story is called "The Good Neighbors" by Lars Jensen and Flemming Andersen and makes part of the comic subseries Tamers of Nonhuman Threats.Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story The Good Neighbors Humperdink appears unnamed in the 1955 film No Hunting in which he posthumously inspires Donald to take part in hunting season. Elvira "Grandma" Duck (n√©e Coot; born c. 1855) is Donald's grandmother and the Duck family matriarch. In most stories, she is simply referred to as "Grandma Duck". She was introduced to the Disney comic universe by Al Taliaferro in the newspaper comic strips - as a picture in 1940, and in person in 1943. Taliaferro found inspiration for her in his own mother-in-law, Donnie M. Wheaton. According to Don Rosa, Grandma was born around 1855. Later, she married Humperdink Duck, and they had three children named Quackmore (Donald's father), Daphne (Gladstone's mother),  Eider (Fethry's father). Grandma Duck also helped to raise her great-grandkids, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Grandma's great-nephew Gus Goose is her farmhand and lives on the farm. However, he is very lazy and does not work much. In some stories, especially older ones, Grandma Duck also gets help from Gus and Jaq, the two mice from Cinderella. Grandma's farm is the center of the Duck family's annual holiday gatherings, with said gatherings usually arranged by her. These are always merry and warm and interesting occasions. Grandma is a great cook, and once won a medal for her cherry pie. She is depicted as driving a Detroit Electric automobile. She refuses to acquire any modern gadgetry, and only watches weather programs on the TV. Grandma made her animated debut in the 1960 Wonderful World of Color episode "This is Your Life, Donald Duck", where she was voiced by June Foray. The episode depicted her great difficulty in raising Donald, a strong-willed and ill-tempered duckling from the moment he was hatched. She also made a non-speaking cameo in Mickey's Christmas Carol, as well can be spotted in background in episode of DuckTales "Horse Scents". In The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck by Don Rosa it is shown that her father is Clinton Coot, her mother is Gertrude Gadwall, her grandfather is Cornelius Coot, and her brother is Casey Coot. In older Italian stories (including Marco Rota's From Egg to Duck), she is sometimes shown as Scrooge McDuck's sister, but this tradition is no longer alive. Occasionally they have also been portrayed as being cousins, another now rarely enforced tradition. The "truth" is that Scrooge is the brother of Elvira's daughter-in-law. Quackmore Duck (born 1875) is the father of Donald Duck. His parents are Humperdink and Elvira "Grandma" Duck. He was born in Duckburg, and from and early age displayed a very nasty temper. He worked at his parents' farm till 1902 when he met Hortense McDuck and they became engaged. He started working for her brother Scrooge McDuck. By 1908 he was helping Hortense and her sister Matilda McDuck run their brother's empire as Scrooge's chief accountant, mainly because Scrooge thought that as a possible heir he would probably work hard and stay honest. In 1920 he finally married Hortense and later in the same year became the father of twins: Donald and Della. So he and Hortense became parents when they already were more than 40 years old, according to Don Rosa. He remained the chief accountant till 1930 when a fight between Scrooge and his family ended all relationships between them. Quackmore retired and it is believed he died sometimes around 1950, although his exact date of death and death place are still unknown. "I shudder to imagine the kid that would come from that unholy union!", exclaimed Humperdink in "The Invader Of Fort Duckburg" by Don Rosa, predicting the type of child his grandson Donald would be because of the explosive temperaments of Quackmore and his wife Hortense. There is a panel in "The Sign Of The Triple Distelfink" by Rosa where Humperdink is behind Quackmore and Hortense during the birthday party of his daughter Daphne Duck, and his facial expression suggests he is disappointed with an argument between the couple. Since both characters have a quick temper, their marriage possibly was full of ups and downs.  Hortense Duck (n√©e McDuck; born 1876) is the wife of Quackmore Duck and Donald's mother. She was born in Scotland and is the youngest sister of Scrooge McDuck. Daphne Gander (n√©e Duck) is Donald's aunt and the mother of Gladstone Gander. In the story "The Sign of The Triple Distelfink" (1998), Don Rosa explains that Gladestone's good luck was inherited from his mother, after a traveling worker painted a giant sign of the "Triple Distelfink" on her parents' stable on the day of her birth. The symbol was supposed to bring the baby luck, and it did: Daphne was always incredibly lucky. She worked in her parents' farm until at least 1902. Later, she stopped working and started living on the things she won in contests. She married Goosetave Gander, and in 1920 became the mother of Gladstone Gander. Gladstone was born on her birthday and under the protection of the same symbol as his mother. Eider Duck is Donald's uncle. He was first mentioned in August 1944 in the story "The Fighting Falcon" by Carl Barks. In this story, Donald receives a falcon called Farragut as a present by his Uncle Eider who does not live in Duckburg. Farragut arrives inside a big box brought to Donald's house by an expressman. Barks never mentioned Eider again but Don Rosa decided to include him in his Duck Family Tree. According to Rosa, Eider is the son of Humperdink and Elvira Duck and the father of Abner and Fethry Duck. As of 1902, he worked on his parents' farm. He later married Lulubelle Loon and became the father of at least two sons, Abner "Whitewater" Duck and Fethry Duck. Lulubelle Duck (n√©e Loon) is the wife of Eider Duck and the mother of Abner and Fethry Duck, according to Don Rosa's version of the Duck family tree. She doesn't have any comic appearance so far, not even a cameo one. Sheriff Dan Duck (aka Cousin Dan) is an old cousin of Donald who happens to be sheriff of a Western town called Bent Spur Gulch. Dan originally has thick, dark-grey eyebrows, a long, dark-grey mustache and long, dark-grey hair on the left and right sides of his head. He is generally shown holding a crutch. He appeared in two comic stories, "Daredevil Deputy" by Jack Bradbury,Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Daredevil Deputy where he asks Donald to replace him while he recovers from "a touch of rheumatism",  and "Trigger Gulch Gang" by Tony Strobl,Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Trigger Gulch Gang where he has only a brief appearance on the first page. Dan Duck is presumably first cousin once removed of Donald because of his advanced age. A remake of "Daredevil Deputy" was drawn by Chilean cartoonist Vicar for the Danish publisher Egmont. It's called "Sheriff for a Day", first published in 1978.Coa Inducks - Page to the Danish comic story Sheriff for a Day  Donald Duck (born 1920) is the son of Quackmore and Hortense Duck, and the most well-known member of the family. His girlfriend is Daisy Duck. He does not have any children of his own, but he is very close with his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. In some stories Donald is the triplet's legal guardian, such as in the 1942 film The New Spirit in which Donald lists the boys as dependants on his income tax form. Della Duck (called Dumbella in Donald's Nephews; born 1920) is the mother of Huey, Dewey, and Louie. She is first described as Donald's cousin, but was later Donald's twin sister. She was first mentioned in a 1937 Donald Duck Sunday strip on October 17, 1937 in which she writes a letter explaining to Donald that she is sending her sons to stay with him. She appears as a child in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck in which she and Donald are wearing identical sailor suits. Both she and Donald are linked to Scrooge McDuck in equal measure, and yet Donald is always referred to as Scrooge's closest living relative, suggesting she has disappeared or died. A story about Donald Duck's 80th birthday says Della was an astronaut and gave the nephews to Donald before a dangerous space expedition.Announcement of the Dutch Donald Duck magazine on Facebook for the 80th anniversary collectors edition with a snapshot of the story introducing Donald to his nephews and Dumbella being in space Donald's cousin Fethry Duck was created for the Disney Studio Program by Dick Kinney and Al Hubbard and was first used in the story "The Health Nut", published on August 2, 1964. Kinney and Hubbard created Fethry to be a beatnik member of the Duck family; the definition of that term‚Äî"a person who rejects or avoids conventional behavior"‚Äîis Fethry to a tee. In personality, Fethry is an obsessive New Age thinker, eagerly trying to pursue various new hobbies and lifestyles based on books he has read or TV programs he has seen. Fethry is also quite a blunderer, however, so his new hobbies tend to cause chaos for his friends and family. In "The Health Nut," Fethry is first seen running from the airport to Donald's house, implying he isn't a Duckburg citizen at that point in time. It is also implied that Donald and Fethry know each other from earlier: Fethry calls Donald by a nickname, "Don." Elsewhere in the story, Donald thinks to himself, "Wonder what [Fethry's] kick is this time?", making it clear that he knows about Fethry's tendency to come up with temporary obsessions every now and then. Fethry wears a stocking cap, for reasons revealed in "The Health Nut": he was convinced by a self-help book author that one's head is healthier when it's kept hot. Fethry's trademark sweater, usually bearing a black stripe, is typically a different color depending on which country the story is published in: in Brazil, his sweater is generally yellow; in the Italian comics, he usually wears a red one; and, in the comic books of Egmont Publishing, the traditional color of his sweater is pink. The early Fethry comics were created for the Disney Studio Program for publication outside of the United States. An exception to this are three stories with Fethry drawn by Tony Strobl that appeared in Gold Key Comics published in 1966 (Donald Duck #105 and #106 plus Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #304). Strobl actually drew more than two hundred comic stories with Fethry for the market outside USA. The first comic story with Fethry published in the USA was "Donald's Buzzin Cousin",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Donald's Buzzin Cousin which‚Äîlike "The Health Nut"‚Äîshows Fethry as a nonresident of Duckburg coming to meet Donald after a long time away, though the plot is otherwise very different. Later, some of the Fethry Studio Program stories were reprinted in the Wonderful World of Disney giveaway magazine published in 1969‚Äì1970 for Gulf Oil. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Fethry mostly appeared in European- and Brazilian-produced stories; in Brazil, he even had his own comic book title during the 1980s, which lasted 56 issues. More recently (2003‚Äìpresent), Fethry's modern Egmont and 1960s Kinney/Hubbard stories have been published in domestic American comics: Uncle Scrooge and Walt Disney's Comics and Stories. Hubbard and Kinney developed more than fifty comic stories with Fethry, originally for the market outside USA.Coa Inducks - Page to Al Hubbard's stories with Fethry Duck Nevertheless, they did see publication in English at the time: the vast majority were published in Australia between 1964 and 1969, often in one-shot comics billed Donald and Fethry Duck‚Äîsuggesting a comedic duo‚Äîor simply Fethry Duck.Coa Inducks - Page to the Australian comic cook Giant (G Series) No. 338Coa Inducks - Page to the Australian Comic Book Giant (G Series) No. 475 In Brazilian and Italian stories, Fethry is depicted in various occupations, including as a reporter (alongside his cousin Donald Duck and, sometimes, Daisy Duck) and comic strip artist for Scrooge McDuck's newspaper, the Duckburg Chronicle. Fethry has also gained a superheroic alter ego, The Red Bat (parody of Batman, like Donald's Paperinik), and a number of supporting characters, among them his girlfriend the urban hippie Gloria and his nephew the bratty Dugan Duck. After discovering Fethry is The Red Bat, Gloria also decided to become a superhero herself, so The Purple Butterfly (presumably a parody of Batgirl) was born, and she eventually ends up saving The Red Bat when he's in a jam. Gloria wears a hippie-like style of clothing and she usually is a carefree girl. She appeared as one of Daisy Duck's closest friends in some stories. But according to a couple of old Brazilian stories, Gloria wasn't the first and only love of Fethry. He had a girlfriend called Rita Gansa (original Brazilian name) whom he really liked before knowing Gloria.Coa-Inducks - Page for the character "Rita Gansa" Like Gladstone Gander, Rita looks like a mix between an anthropomorphic duck and an anthropomorphic goose. She was actually Fethry's childhoold classmate. There is even one story where Gloria and Rita contest against each other to know who is Red Bat's biggest fan. According to a version of Don Rosa's Duck Family Tree, Fethry is the son of Eider Duck and Lulubelle Loon, is the cousin of Donald Duck, and has a brother named Abner Duck. However, since Fethry was not created by Carl Barks and was never used in any Barks stories, Rosa does not consider Fethry part of the Duck family. Be that as it may, due to editorial pressure stemming from the character's popularity in Europe, Rosa reluctantly included him in the tree anyway. With Donald, Fethry is a member of the Tamers of Nonhuman Threats, a special super-secret organization fighting hostile paranormal creatures of all sorts to protect the earth. These stories are all produced by Danish creative house Egmont Creative A/S and drawn by Flemming Andersen. They are published in pocketbooks. Fethry also works, again together with Donald, for Scrooge McDuck's secret organization, originally (in Italian) called the P.I.A.. Besides, he started starring stories as an assistant of the detective Umperio Bogarto (an Italian character whose name is a play on "Humphrey Bogart") on 1996 and as Moby Duck's First Mate in the early 2000s.Coa-Inducks - Page to the comic subseries Le storie della Baia In earlier times, Egmont used Fethry very seldom; from the late 1990s, however, Egmont decided to bring back the character and create a whole range of new stories around him, this time based on the original 1960s concept of the character. Donald has often teamed up with Fethry to do all sort of jobs for Scrooge (usually with disastrous results), with Donald being the "straight man" and Fethry the "funny man". These terms are rather loosely applied, however, insofar as Donald's reactions to Fethry, and attempts to neutralize him, are often every bit as funny as Fethry's doings. In 1970s stories drawn by Tony Strobl, Fethry is the owner of an over-friendly dog named Poochie. Some Brazilian cartoonists also used Fethry's little-known pet.Coa-Inducks - Index to stories with Poochie Whitewater Duck was created by Carl Barks and used by him only in the story "Log Jockey", published in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #267 on December, 1962. According to that story, he is a distant cousin of Donald,Coa Inducks - Excerpt of the first panel of the comic story Log Jockey and works as a lumberjack in the woods. Don Rosa's Duck Family Tree states that Whitewater's real name is Abner, and "Whitewater" is a nickname. He is also shown to be a son of Eider Duck and Lulubelle Loon and Fethry Duck's brother, making him Donald's first cousin. Nevertheless, the changes of Whitewater's original name and his kinship to Donald are not largely accepted.Coa Inducks - Page for the character Whitewater Duck His second appearance in "Smarter Than The Toughies" (published in the USA in Uncle Scrooge No. 349) by Lars Jensen and Daniel Branca, Whitewater is the nephew of Scrooge McDuck's cousin Douglas, making him Donald's second cousin. In his third appearance in "Too Many Donalds" (as of July 2013 unpublished in the USA) by Lars Jensen and Carlos Mota, Whitewater was in a relationship with Donna Duck. In this story, Donald introduces Whitewater to Daisy as his distant cousin. Dudly D. Duck is a cousin of Donald who appears in the comic story "Why All the Crabby Ducks?" by Vic Lockman and Mike Arens.Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Why All the Crabby Ducks? He is a flopped architect and inventor who was responsible for the construction of the "Jog Tunnel", which annoys the citizens of Duckburg because it really has a jog in it, and for the bad planning of Duckburg's streets. Therefore, Dudly became very unpopular and was forced to live isolated in a lonely street, including his name was forgotten until the day that Donald discovers who planned the "Jog Tunnel", and then his girlfriend Daisy Duck reveals who is Dudly Duck through the newspaper where she works as reporter. A reporter rival of Daisy ends up discovering that Dudly is related to Donald, who in turn becomes unpopular too. Dudly appears in a Brazilian comic story where Fethry Duck works as reporter of Scrooge's newspaper, the Duckburg Chronicle, and he intends to interview Dudly, who is returning to Duckburg. He also had a cameo appearance in another Brazilian comic story where Gyro Gearloose is called by the Mayor of Duckburg (a dogface version) to fix a sinking building planned by Dudly. Actually, this building originally appeared in "Why All the Crabby Ducks?".  Huebert "Huey", Deuteronomy "Dewey", and Louis "Louie" Duck are Donald's three nephews and identical triplet sons of Della Duck and an unnamed father. Phooey Duck is a tongue-in-cheek name for a non-existent fourth nephew of Donald Duck who was sometimes drawn by accident.http://www.sullivanet.com/duckburg/phooey.htm The name was coined by Disney comic editor Bob Foster. "Aw, phooey" is also one of Donald's catch phrases. Dugan Duck is Fethry Duck's nephew who is a little bit younger than Huey, Dewey and Louie. According to the Brazilian comic story "O Nascimento Do Biquinho",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story O Nascimento Do Biquinho he is the first nephew of Fethry, being son of his sister, who lives in the periphery of Duckburg. Since Eider and Lulubelle, Fethry's official parents, apparently don't have a daughter, Dugan's mother could be a child from a previous union of Lulubelle. Dugan originally owned yellow feathers, an uncommon characteristic for Disney Ducks given by his Brazilian creators, which was authorized by Disney Publishing Worldwide. He's a stubborn child whose most common activity is to cause troubles for his Uncle Fethry, who adopted Dugan after he and his girlfriend Gloria rescued him from a forest. Dugan's most frequent partner is usually a little pignose girl called Cintia, whose mother happens to be Fethry's neighbor and she really dislikes Dugan. He made a huge success in Brazil during the 1980s, when his charismatic figure was quite explored by Brazilian cartoonists, but he practically disappeared from the Brazilian comics in the next decade. Some Italian cartoonists have been used Dugan once in a while, but he just appears with white feathers in Italian comics. The Coot family, typically called the Coot Kin in stories, are the relatives of Grandma Duck and, along with the Clan McDuck, comprise the third major branch of Donald's family tree. The name "Coot" was used by several comic authors including Carl Barks, but Don Rosa was the first to show their relationship to Donald. The members of the family are depicted as white Pekin ducks like Donald, although real-life coots are typically black. Cornelius Coot (1790‚Äì1880) founded Duckburg (and the real-world, but since closed Mickey's Toontown Fair at the Magic Kingdom). He first appeared as a statue in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #138 in the 1952 story "Statuesque Spendthrifts" by Carl Barks. His statue and legacy has later appeared in many other stories. Although Cornelius was a well-known figure to readers of Disney comics, his character history was not told until Don Rosa began using the character in the late 1980s. The following history is mainly based on Rosa's stories, especially "His Majesty, McDuck", first published in Uncle Scrooge Adventures #14. Cornelius Coot was born in 1790 as an American citizen. His ancestors had been in America for quite some time and his roots are believed to reach to the colonization of Jamestown, Virginia (1607) and the voyage of the Mayflower (1620). But he is the first member of the Coot Kin to gain prominence. His birthplace is unknown and before reaching Duckburg he was a wandering hunter. He apparently had travelled all the way from the East to the West coast making his living by trading furs from the animals he killed. He arrived at Fort Drake Borough, a British military base in Calisota, in 1818. He was apparently only looking for some trading with the soldiers, but his life took some unexpected turns. During his stay the Fort was attacked by Spanish troops from neighbouring California (the fictional Calisota includes parts historically belonging to Northern California. The Duck's version of California only includes the historical Southern California). The small British garrison could not defend the Fort and decided to retreat. To save face the commander made a deal with young Cornelius. The Fort would pass into his possession and if the Spanish managed to conquer it, he and his troops had nothing to do with the failure other than trusting an insane American to guard. Cornelius agreed. After the escape of the British he managed to frighten the Spanish away by making them believe that British reinforcements were approaching by popping some sweetcorn. (His statue depicts this.) The abandoned Fort was now Cornelius's and he had big plans for it. He renamed it Fort Duckburg and turned it into a trading camp for hunters. Soon enough, some of them began to settle down and start their own families. Cornelius started his own farm and started acting as the leader of the new settlement. Pretty soon, a village was flourishing in Duckburg. Calisota was annexed into the new independent state of Mexico in 1821 but Duckburg acted much as a city state. It had its own laws, its own leaders and thanks to Cornelius its own defense force. Cornelius organized the citizens that could carry weapons into the Woodchuck Militia, a force that would guard the territory from any threat, including any conflicts with the Native Americans of the area. Cornelius turned the old Fort into the militia's base. He personally supervised the repairs to the Fort and had the idea to build tunnels under the Fort so that even during a siege they could still move in and out of the Fort. Besides the tunnel they made, they found an already existing tunnel built by Fenton Penworthy and his men in 1579 after the Fort was built. Cornelius explored the tunnel. He found the body of the long-dead Fenton and gave him a proper burial. He also found the information on the Guardians of the Lost Library. He found and kept the book written by Fenton and containing the secret knowledge of the Guardians. Apparently he appointed himself the next Guardian, the first after Fenton. Cornelius had managed to pipe mountain water into the village. He was a capable leader and managed to improve his settlers' relationships with the Native Americans over time, and Cornelius married a Native American woman named Piankahorn. They had their only known son Clinton Coot in 1830. Through the rest of his life Cornelius continued to act as Duckburg's unofficial leader. Even when Calisota and neighbouring California were annexed to the USA in 1848 nothing truly changed in Duckburg. When Cornelius died in 1880, aged 90, he was a very respected family man but over time he has been honored by the citizens of Duckburg as the "father" of the city. The old hunter has gained legendary status in Calisota. A statue of Cornelius holding an ear of corn is present in Mickey's Toontown Fair in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. Before 1996, the land was known as Mickey's Birthdayland/Starland, and was set in the city of Duckburg. Clinton Coot (1830-1910) was first mentioned in Uncle Scrooge Adventures #27 in the story "Guardians of the Lost Library", first published in July, 1994. There he was introduced as the son of Cornelius Coot and the founder of The Junior Woodchucks, inspired by the book given to him by his father. In The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck it is revealed that he is the father of Grandma Duck. In Don Rosa's Duck Family Tree, Clinton is married to Gertrude Gadwall and their two children are Grandma Duck (Elvira Coot) and Casey Coot. He is named after Bill Clinton, who was running for President of the United States when Don Rosa created the character. Gertrude Coot (n√©e Gadwall) is the wife of Clinton Coot and the mother of Casey and Elvira Coot ("Grandma Duck"). Like Lulubelle Loon, Gertrude has appeared only in Don Rosa's version of the Duck family tree. Casey Coot (1860-c. 1960) first appeared in "Last Sled to Dawson", first published in June, 1988. He is introduced as an unsuccessful gold prospector and friend of Scrooge McDuck during his years in Klondike. In need of money he sold to the significantly more successful Scrooge McDuck his share in Duckburg, Calisota, USA. His share included "Killmule Hill" which renamed to "Killmotor Hill" comprises the land where Scrooge's money bin stands on. He later appeared in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Part 8 and Hearts of the Yukon. In The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Part 10 it is revealed that he and Grandma Duck are brother and sister. In Don Rosa's Duck Family Tree he is featured as a grandson of Cornelius Coot, a son of Clinton Coot and Gertrude Gadwall. He married to Gretchen Grebe and they had at least two kids named Fanny and Cuthbert Coot, being the maternal grandfather of Fanny's son Gus Goose. Gretchen Coot (n√©e Grebe) is the wife of Casey Coot, the mother of Cuthbert and Fanny Coot, and the maternal grandmother of Gus Goose. Fanny Coot is the mother of Donald's cousin Gus Goose and she was first mentioned in the Donald Duck comic strip of May 9, 1938 by Bob Karp & Al Taliaferro where Gus first appeared. But Gus's mother's surname wasn't revealed in this comic strip, where she identifies herself in a letter to Donald as "Aunt Fanny".Coa Inducks - Excerpt of the Sunday comic strip YD 38-05-09 as published in 'Donald Duck 287' (Gladstone) So she was originally sister of one of Donald's parents. In Don Rosa's Duck Family Tree she is featured as a daughter of Casey Coot and his wife Gretchen Grebe,  and so a niece of Elvira Coot, Donald's paternal grandmother, and first cousin of Donald's father, Quackmore Duck. It's possible to consider that Quackmore had a high regard for his cousin Fanny, and for this reason Donald was taught to treat her as aunt. Fanny also had a brother named Cuthbert Coot and she married Luke the Goose,  and then became the mother of Gus Goose. Cuthbert Coot was introduced in the story "Webfooted Wrangler," first published in April 1945, as a distant cousin of Donald Duck and a rancher. In Don Rosa's Duck family tree he is included as a member of the Coot Kin as son of Casey Coot and Gretchen Grebe. Kildare Coot  was introduced by artist Romano Scarpa as a highly eccentric fourth cousin of Donald Duck in the story "Sgrizzo, il papero pi√π balzano del mondo" (roughly translated as "Kildare Coot, the weirdest duck in the world"), first published on October 25, 1964. Though his exact relationship to Donald remains uncertain his last name suggests he belongs to the Coot Kin and that he is related to Donald through Elvira Coot, Donald's paternal grandmother. Curiously, Kildare usually treats Gideon McDuck, Scrooge's half-brother, as his uncle. He calls Gideon 'Zio', which means uncle in Italian.Coa Inducks - Excerpt of the comic story La grande corsa Paperopoli-Ocopoli Kildare and his fellow Andy Ascott (original Italian name) appear as reporters of Gideon's newspaper, The Cricket, in some Italian stories. Luke Goose (sometimes called Luke the Goose) is the father of Donald's cousin Gus Goose. He was originally supposed to be Gladstone Gander's father,Carl Barks's Duck Family Tree'The Duck Family Tree' - Genealogy by Carl Barks Daphne Duck's husband and Gus's uncle, but Carl Barks later changed his mind, making Goosetave Gander (who was originally Gladstone's adoptive father after Luke and Daphne "overate at a free-lunch picnic") Gladstone's biological father and Daphne's husband. Luke the Goose disappeared from the tree. When Don Rosa created his Duck Family Tree, he used Luke Goose (removing the "the" in his name) and made him the husband of Fanny Coot and Gus Goose's father. Gus Goose is Donald Duck's second cousin, and the great-nephew of Grandma Duck. Gus's main personality trait is being quite gluttonous, as Donald discovered when Gus came for a visit in Gus' first appearance, the 1939 animated short Donald's Cousin Gus. Within Disney comics, Gus is usually shown living as a farmhand on Grandma Duck's farm outside of Duckburg. Along with his gluttony, Gus is quite lazy, often doing little if any work on Grandma's farm. He also has a tendency of falling asleep at random occasions, sometimes even standing up. Gus made no appearances in DuckTales, but there is a background character in the series, Vacation Van Honk, who looks very much like him. Recently, Gus Goose appeared in the 2000s animated series Disney's House of Mouse, as the club's gluttonous chef, speaking only in honks rather than words. He also made non-speaking cameo appearances in both Mickey's Christmas Carol and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The friend and neighbor Gustav Goose from Quack Pack is probably not the same as Cousin Gus since there are very few similarities (aside from the name and general size of the character). Some confusion is also caused by the German comicbook version of Gladstone Gander being referred to as "Gustav Gans" ("Gustav Goose"). Gus Goose has appeared as boyfriend of a classy and rich anthropomorphic swan called Cissy Swann in Danish stories.Coa Inducks - Index to stories with Cissy Swann In Italy, a nephew of him called Pepper already appeared in two comic stories.Coa Inducks - Index to stories with Pepper Goostave Gander is Gladstone Gander's father. In some early stories he is married to Matilda McDuck, Scrooge's sister and adopted Gladstone and his brother and had a son, Osar, but Carl Barks later had him married to Daphne Duck instead. They are considered the parents of Gladstone Gander; although his wife and son's luck does not include him. "Us Ganders have never sunk low enough to associate with you Ducks!", exclaimed Gladstone to Donald in "Race to the South Seas" by Carl Barks,Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Race to the South Seas suggesting that there is a mutual antipathy between his father's family and his mother's. In this same story, Gladstone exclaims, "Us Ganders have never worked!",Coa Inducks - Excerpt of the comic story Race to the South Seas what suggests that originally Gladstone's luck came from his father's side. Gladstone Gander is Donald's cousin, the son of Goosetave and Daphne Gander. Gladstone was created by Carl Barks and first appeared in the story "Wintertime Wager" in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #88 (January, 1948). Gladstone is a lazy and infuriatingly lucky goose who never fails to upset his first cousin Donald Duck. Gladstone's luck defies probability and provides him with anything he desires, with hardly the need of effort. As Don Rosa has commented on the character: "Gladstone is unwilling to make the slightest effort to gain something that his luck cannot give him, and, when things go wrong, he resigns immediately, certain that around the next corner a wallet, dropped by a passer-by, will be waiting for him". For all his luck Gladstone has no achievements to be proud of and no true ambitions, as he is incapable of long-term planning. All of this is in stark contrast to his relative Scrooge McDuck, who is also capable of taking advantage of opportunities but works hard to create situations favorable for him, is strongly motivated by his ambitions and takes pride in forming his fortune by his own efforts. He is a rival of Donald for the love of Donald's girlfriend Daisy Duck. Gladstone is also considered among the prime candidates for Scrooge McDuck's succession. For all of these reasons, he and Donald have formed an intense rivalry with each other. Gladstone's arrogance and outrageous luck, combined with Donald's own ego and belief he can still best him despite all odds---or as Don Rosa's version of Scrooge comments, "Donald's eternal tendency towards self-destruction"---have set the stage for many stories featuring the two cousins' confrontations. Occasionally, he is a rival to Scrooge McDuck himself who resents his complete reliance on his uncanny good fortune such as in the story "The Gold Nugget Boat."  In such stories, often the only way Gladstone can be believably defeated is to have him win by the letter of the law while the heroes take the bigger prize. In the above story for example, Gladstone and Scrooge are competing in a gold prospecting contest in which Gladstone finds a gold nugget the nephews fashioned from a gold item Scrooge already owns to stop him from killing himself from overexertion in the contest.  Gladstone finds the nugget and returns to win, but Scrooge and his nephews then find a much bigger nugget they are able to fashion into a boat to return to civilization afterward with a monetary worth that is easily more than Gladstone's find. Another instance was in the "Salmon Derby", where Gladstone catches the biggest fish and wins a new car but Donald manages to save a wealthy tycoon's daughter and is able to purchase a much bigger car. Another instance was where both Donald and Gladstone were competing for a job as a cameraman for a nature film director because Daisy was the director's assistant, Gladstone got the job but wished he hadn't because he wound up trudging through a swamp to film giant spiders while Daisy stayed behind in America, with Donald. Barks gradually developed Gladstone's personality and at first used him frequently‚Äîin 24 stories between 1948 and 1953, the first five years of his existence. Gladstone's luck evolved slowly. In his first three appearances in 1948 ("Wintertime Wager", "Gladstone Returns", "Links Hijinks"), he was portrayed as the mirror image of Donald: an obstinate braggart, perhaps just a little bit more arrogant. In his next two appearances, "Rival Beachcombers" and "The Goldilocks Gambit", Gladstone is portrayed as merely lazy and irritable, and also gullible. The breakthrough of his lucky streak occurs in 1949, within the adventure story "Race to the South Seas". His and Donald's rivalry over Daisy is established in "Donald's Love Letters" (1949), "Wild About Flowers" (1950), and "Knightly Rivals" (1951), and as potential heirs to Scrooge's fortune in "Some Heir Over the Rainbow" (1953). After that, Barks felt unable to develop the character further, finding him basically unsympathetic, and began using him less frequently. But by then, Gladstone had found a steady place in the Duck universe. He was first used by an artist other than Barks in 1951: "Presents For All" by Del Connell and Bob Moore. His exact relation to the Duck Family Tree is somewhat uncertain. In Carl Barks' original version of the family tree from the 1950s, Gladstone was the son of Luke the Goose and Daphne Duck who died by overeating at a free-lunch picnic. He was later adopted by Matilda McDuck and Goosetave Gander. Later, Barks is reported to have done away with the adoption, which was never featured in any story. (Of course, no stories denying the event were published.) In a more recent version of the family tree created by Don Rosa, Daphne Duck (Donald's paternal aunt) married Goosetave Gander and the two were Gladstone's parents. This is consistent with what Gladstone says in "Race to the South Seas": "Scrooge McDuck is my mother's brother's brother-in-law". Don Rosa's stories follow this viewpoint; in "The Sign of the Triple Distelfink" (first published on February 4, 1997), he added the fact that Gladstone was born on the day of Daphne's birthday on 1920, under the protection sign of the Triple Distelfink, thus inheriting his mother's luck. Gladstone appeared in several episodes of the animated series DuckTales, where he was voiced by Rob Paulsen, later noted for playing Pinky on the cartoon Pinky and the Brain.  In the episode "Dime Enough for Luck", Gladstone is an unwitting stooge for Magica De Spell in one of her attempts to steal Scrooge's Number One Dime.  He returns in the episode "Dr. Jekyll & Mr. McDuck", where he accidentally bids on an item that turns out to be valuable. This inspires Scrooge to bid on the next item‚Äîa trunk containing Dr. Jekyll's formula‚Äîwhich sets the plot in motion. He appears as a main character in the Big Little Book series book "Luck of the Ducks" (1969). He also makes non-speaking cameo appearances in the episodes "Sweet Duck of Youth" and "Till Nephews Do Us Part", as well in episode of House of Mouse "Goofy For A Day". Gladstone appears in 2000 computer game Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers in his traditional role of Donald's rival for Daisy's affection, and every time a Boss Battle is about to start, Gladstone greets Donald, but always gets hurt, like, becoming squished by a giant bird, getting knocked off a building by a wrecking ball, being sent crashing to the bottom of a haunted mansion, and even gets sent back to Duckburg inside a pipe, and every time he gets hurt, he keeps saying that he's found a nickel. Despite having an eternal crush on Daisy Duck, Gladstone has appeared in love with other duck girls in Italian and Danish comic stories. The most important one possibly is Linda, who really conquered Gladstone, making him want to give up all his luck, since she's unlucky and absolutely hates lucky people. She appeared in two subsequent comic stories.Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Gastone e la fortuna inopportunaCoa Inducks - Page to the comic story Gastone e il talismano annullafortuna Shamrock Gander is Gladstone's nephew. Shamrock first appeared in a story printed in Daisy Duck's Diary Four Color #648 where he was shown to be as lucky as his uncle Gladstone, making it clear that originally Gladstone's luck came from his father's side indeed. He probably is son of a brother of Gladstone, since his surname is also Gander. He was used once in a Brazilian comic story, where he contests with Donald's nephews to get Daisy's nieces attention.Coa Inducks - Page to the Brazilian comic story O Trevinho da Sorte This section contains a list of characters with the surname "Duck" who may or may not be related to Donald. As Don Rosa explained, "Duck" is an understandably common name in Duckburg (just as "Smith" or "Jones" are common in the real-life United States) and does not necessarily identify a blood relation of Donald. Note that other characters who are ducks but do not have this surname are included at List of Donald Duck universe characters ¬ß Duck characters. 0.0. Duck and Mata Harrier are a secret-agent duo. They were created by Dick Kinney and Al HubbardCoa Inducks - Al Hubbard's Page during the same period in which this creative duo of comic artists developed other important characters for Disney comics, such as Fethry Duck, Tabby and Hard Haid Moe.Who's Who of American Comic Books 1928-1999 - Informations About Dick KinneyWho's Who of American Comic Books 1928-1999 - Informations About Al Hubbard 0.0.

They appeared for the first time in the story "The Case of the Purloined Pearls",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story The Case of the Purloined Pearls where they fought against agents of the evil organization "BLONK". Then the agents of this organization became the traditional rivals of 0.0. Duck and Mata Harrier in their subsequent stories, most of them created by Brazilian cartoonists. 0.0. Duck owns a small dog ironically called Wolf. The latest comic appearance of 0.0.

April, May, and June Duck are the triplet nieces of Daisy Duck. When they appear at family gatherings their parents are never present and they usually accompany Daisy. They presumably live in Duckburg. They were created by Carl Barks and were first used in a story published in February 1953, "Flip Decision".Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Flip Decision "I don't know how you knew I was here visiting my sister, but it's about time you showed up!", exclaimed Daisy to Donald in the first panel of its last page, making it clear that her nieces are daughters of some sister of her. In the comic story "Lady Lawmen" by Tony Strobl,Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Lady Lawmen Daisy and her nieces discover that Grandma has a secret in her past, and Daisy just pretends not to be interested in discovering this one, but then April, May and June catch her red-handed delving into a trunk of Grandma, and Daisy tries to justify it to her nieces by saying "It's our duty as concerned relatives to pry... I mean, study the history of our families!". In some stories, mostly Dutch, they live along with their aunt, but in other comics, such as the comics by Barks, they are only visiting Daisy. The triplets act as Donald's nephews' (Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck) female counterparts, occasional rivals, occasional friends, and occasional dates. They are members of the organization The Junior Chickadees, who serve as The Junior Woodchucks' female counterparts. Unusually for children of their age, the girls routinely wear high-heeled shoes. Like the nephews, April, May & June usually wear the colors "Red", "Blue" and "Green", but unlike them, a color assignment has never been established. The girls also frequently wear "Yellow", "Purple" and "Orange". However, one might consider "blue" to be April's color since that was the color she wore when she appeared solo in "Dell Giant" #35. It is also unknown which nephew is paired with which niece when they double date with their Uncle Donald and Aunt Daisy. In 1998, the editors of the Dutch 'Donald Duck' weekly magazine decided the three girls should be modernized, and they got permission from the Disney Company to do so. Dutch Duck-comic artist Mau Heymans designed a new hairdo and new wardrobe for April, May and June. They now don't look the same at all in Dutch stories, and don't have the 'girly' occupations anymore they had when Barks created them. In some Danish stories, the new hairdo has been copied. April, May, and June were not seen in animation until they were given a special cameo appearance in the House of Mouse episode "Ladies' Night".Ladies' Night. The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts. Retrieved on March 22, 2008. Curiously, April, May, and June never appeared on DuckTales, but Webby Vanderquack from said series, strongly resembles them. That even led Dutch translators to give Webby the name 'Lizzy', which is used for April in Dutch. May and June are called Juultje and Babetje in The Netherlands.. . Retrieved on March 22, 2008. April, May, and June returned to American comics in Walt Disney's Comics And Stories #698. The story had them retelling "Little Red Riding Hood" with the girls as red and the Beagle Boys as the wolf. April, May and June Duck were clearly created by Barks to be Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck's childhood sweethearts,Coa Inducks - Excerpt of the comic story Flip Decision therefore it's very controversial to consider that the father of this set of triplet boys and the mother of this set of triplet girls are both Daisy's siblings, since the two sets of triplets would be first cousins in this case. But there would be no controversy if Donald and Daisy were really second cousins, according to some Duck family trees, since their respective nephews and nieces would be third cousins in this case. The little girls eventually call her Aunt Daisy's boyfriend 'Unca Donald',Coa Inducks - Excerpt of the comic story The Last Word although Donald isn't brother of their father, just like Donald's nephews are shown treating Daisy as aunt in some comic stories, despite the fact that she isn't officially sister of their father as well. Belle Duck is a plus-sized, tall and elegant duck lady. She appeared for the first time in "Belle Corners The Coin Collection" with drawings by the cartoonist Al Hubbard.Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Belle Corners The Coin Collection In this story, Scrooge meets Belle again 40 years after their last meeting. He tells to his grandnephews Huey, Dewey and Louie before her arrival at his house that she was the most charming girl of her town, being daughter of a tycoon who lived in a mansion. But later Belle reveals that now a riverboat called "The Gilded Lily" is everything that she can own, since she spent all her inheritance money. Scrooge cannot hide his surprise at seeing his old crush's look after all those years when they finally meet each other in the story. Tony Strobl was the American cartoonist who most frequently drew this character, despite Hubbard was the cartoonist who first drew her.  Belle is an independent, self-assured, generous and warm-hearted woman, and Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck adore her. She also has a joyful personality and she loves to give parties on her riverboat by using Scrooge's money. Borrowing money from Scrooge is generally the first thing that Belle thinks of when she intends to reform "The Gilded Lily" or to buy a new piece of machinery for it. She often shows a daring behavior towards Scrooge, like in "The Return of Belle Duck" by Strobl,Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story The Return of Belle Duck where Scrooge asks her about what they will talk about and she answers, "About your money... and how I'm going to spend it!".Coa Inducks - Excerpt of the story The Return Of Belle Duck, as published in the French comic book Picsou Magazine 95 In "Go West, Young Duck" by Dick Kinney and Tony Strobl,Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Go West, Young Duck Belle tells the story of a European ancestor of her called Christina Duck who tried to find America in 1492. After many years without a comic appearance, the last one had been in a Brazilian story from 1982,Coa Inducks - Page to the Brazilian comic story Carnaval Em Pat√≥polis Belle appeared again  in "Riverboat Rovers" by Lars Jensen and Jos√© Ramon Bernardo, first published in 2007.Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Riverboat Rovers Thus far, Belle Duck's latest appearance was in a Danish story written by Lars Jensen and drawn by William Van Horn's son, Noel Van Horn, first published in 2014.Coa Inducks - Page to the Danish comic story 'Det rene hokus pokus'  Daisy Duck is Donald's girlfriend. Huey, Dewey, and Louie sometimes call her "Aunt Daisy", but it is unclear if this signifies an affinal or fictive relationship.  Darkwing Duck is the protagonist of an eponymous TV series. He is most likely not related to Donald as "Darkwing Duck" is the character's superhero identity, while his name in private life is Drake Mallard. Dickie Duck () was created by Romano Scarpa. She was introduced as Goldie O'Gilt's granddaughter. But in the story "Paperetta e la leggenda del luna park" by Romano ScarpaCoa Inducks - Page to the comic story Paperetta e la leggenda del luna park she calls Huey, Dewey and Louie cuginetti (small/young cousins) (it's in the third panel of its first page) and then cugini (cousins) (it's in the fourth panel of its second page), suggesting that she and Donald's nephews share the same surname in English language because of a kinship. Dickie doesn't own an official family name in Italy, being "Y√®-Y√®" a reference to Y√©-y√©, a style of pop music of the early 1960s, which she uses with her original name, "Paperetta", as if to show her love for pop music. She has become popular in Italy, Denmark, Brazil and some other countries, while she is almost unknown in the USA and others. Dickie clearly seems to be older than Huey, Dewey and Louie. According to Scarpa, she completed her secondary education at a boarding school (Goldie says to Scrooge in the original Italian speech, "Ehm, come sai, ho una nipotina che √® cresciuta in collegio! Ora ne esce...",Coa Inducks - Excerpt of the Italian story Arriva Paperetta Y√®-Y√® which can be loosely translated as "Er, you know, I have a granddaughter who has grown in a boarding school! Now she's leaving..."), so she possibly is around 18 years old. The connection between Goldie and Dickie isn't largely accepted, despite they made two appearances together as grandmother and granddaughter. The first one was in the Italian story "Arriva Paperetta Y√®-Y√®" (free translation: "The Arrival of Dickie Duck"),Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Arriva Paperetta Y√®-Y√® which introduced Dickie in this particular universe. In this story, Goldie drops Dickie off because she cannot take care of her anymore, so she asks Scrooge McDuck to do it for her. And the second one was in another Italian story called "Zio Paperone Pigmalione" ("Uncle Scrooge Benefactor"),Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Zio Paperone Pigmalione where Dickie appears living in Duckburg as Scrooge's house guest. But in later stories with her, she lives in her own house. Sometimes Dickie has worked as a reporter for Brigitta McBridge or for Scrooge's little known brother Gideon McDuck. In Brazil, their name is Pata Lee, (on a reference to the singer Rita Lee) she appeared in her own series with her teen friends the short owl Nettunia, the tall crane Olympia, the handsome pelican Walter, and Beckett, who's actually the name given to the old cartoon character Aracuan Bird, in a series of stories titled Os Adolescentes (translated loosely from Portuguese to The Teenagers) as a bonus story in Ze Carioca (a comic book starring Jos√© Carioca). Nettunia, Olympia and Walter were specially created to be part of Dickie's gang by Brazilian Disney Studios, which belongs to Grupo Abril. That was the first (and probably only) time that a teen gang was introduced in the "Duckverse" (a usual nickname used to refer to the Disney Ducks Universe). Dickie and her four close friends possibly are studying Journalism at some university of Duckburg, because of her clear connection to the reporter career, which was shown in various comic stories. Donald and his nephews never appeared in those stories with Dickie's teen gang. Dickie Duck's first American appearance was in the Boom! Studios run of Uncle Scrooge, in the translation of the storyline "Around the World in 80 Bucks".Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Zio Paperone in vacanza con 80 dollari Just like Moby, Dickie is also one of the few secondary characters who owns a small figurine in two different Italian collections by De Agostini. Dimwitty Duck (originally just called Dim-Witty) is a duck who was introduced in the comic story "The Vanishing Banister",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story The Vanishing Banister where he appears as an assistant of Donald Duck, who in turn appears working as a private detective. Daisy Duck has a brief appearance in the beginning of this one. But there are some old American stories with Dimwitty and Daisy where Donald doesn't appear. In the story "On Disappearing Island",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story On Disappearing Island Dimwitty appeared for the first time as Moby's ship hand and from then on he became the most common supporting character in Moby's stories. Dimwitty is incredibly clumsy but he's loyal and subservient, and maybe that's the reason why Moby keeps him as his ship hand. But a close kinship between them could also explain this fact. Dimwitty is taller than Donald and Moby. In some 1970s stories, Dimwitty was shown as a friend of Gus Goose. There are some old stories where it's revealed that Dimwitty's surname is also "Duck". The first one was "The Fix-it-fiasco",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story The Fix-it-fiasco which also features Daisy. Just like Moby, Dimwitty had also a cameo appearance in the Darkwing Duck / Ducktales crossover called "Dangerous Currency" from 2011. A character called Dim-Witty Jr., who appears in the Junior Woodchuck's comic story "The Green Gauntlet",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story The Green Gauntlet apparently would be son of Dimwitty, since their respective names, looks and behaviors are very similar, including they both wear clothes with a "D" on it. Dimwitty has the initial letter of his name on his long hat, while Dim-Witty Jr. has this same symbol on his orange blouse. Dim-Witty Jr. is called Dimmy by Huey, Dewey and Louie. Moby also calls Dimwitty Dimmy in some of his stories with his first mate. Hustler Duck is an obscure character created by Dick Kinney & Al Hubbard that works as a marketing man. The American cartoonists who most frequently used this character were Jim Fletcher and Vivie Risto, despite Hubbard was the cartoonist who was credited for co-creating him. Hustler is funnily annoying and he wears big round glasses, just like John Rockerduck. He is always ready to sell his services in different professional areas to Uncle Scrooge McDuck in most of his oldest stories. After almost ten years withoug being used in comic stories, Hustler appeared in two Brazilian ones firstly published in 1975. His last appearance was in a Brazilian story from 1991.Coa-Inducks - Index to Hustler Duck stories It was never suggested in comic stories that Hustler Duck is somehow related to Donald Duck. In the comic story "A Star is Born",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story A Star Is Born Hustler calls an aunt of him, asking her to reunite many relatives of them both in the film studio that Scrooge recently acquired.Coa Inducks - Excerpt of the comic story A Star is Born as published in the Australian comic book Giant (G Series) 368 (1966) The name of this aunt isn't revealed.  Moby Duck appears to be a relative of Donald's, but their relationship is never specifically described. His name is a spoof of Moby-Dick. Moby was created by writer Vic Lockman and illustrator Tony Strobl in a 1967 comic book story ("A Whale of an Adventure", Donald Duck #112, March 1967). He made his first animated appearance in the Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color episode "Pacifically Peeking" (October 6, 1968). He first appeared in Donald Duck #112 where he is seen saving Donald from drowning at sea, after Donald was forced to accept Moby's purpose to work as his helper, since Moby's porpoise Porpy pretended to be a threatening shark. Later that year Moby got his own comic book title which ran 11 issues until 1970, and then from 1973 to 1978 (issues #12-30). Illustrators of American Moby Duck stories include Strobl, Kay Wright, and Pete Alvarado. Not seen in the USA for two decades, he was used in a comic subseries produced in Italy during the 2000s. Curiously, Moby had two cameo appearances in the 2010s already. The first one was in an Italian story from 2010,Coa-Inducks - Page to the comic story Zio Paperone imperatore domestico and the second one was in the Darkwing Duck / Ducktales crossover called "Dangerous Currency" from 2011.Eric‚Äôs BOOM! Studios Comic Review: DARKWING DUCK/DUCKTALES: DANGEROUS CURRENCY TPB His only appearances in animation are in a 1968 The Wonderful World of Disney show and a cameo appearance seated at one of the tables in the House of Mouse TV series. Moby has a quick temper and he can be really rude sometimes, not showing any remorse when he acts this way. He also shows a male chauvinist behavior in some stories. Moby is a disaster as a whaler, but a good sailor in general. He makes a living out of carrying cargo, especially for Scrooge McDuck. He also fights pirates and other villains, including the Beagle Boys, Mad Madam Mim, Emil Eagle, The Big Bad Wolf, and Captain Hook. There isn't any comic story where Moby was shown harpooning a whale indeed, however in the American comic story "Whale Bait",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Whale Bait first published in 1969, when Gyro Gearloose asks him why he's so gloomy, he exclaims, "Whales  are scarcer than hen's teeth lately!", suggesting that he had successfully hunted whales on some occasions. But this same story also shows Moby developing affection for whales when he comes face to face with one of them for the first time and hesitates to use the harpoon of his whaler on that one, exclaiming "I-I can't! I never got so cozy with whales before as to look into their big tender pink eyes!". In the Danish comic story "Miraculous Bait",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Miraculous Bait first published in 1972, Moby reveals to Gyro Gearloose that he never could hunt any whale, and for this reason he is using his whaler to deliver letters. In the half-page Danish story "Hitting The Tooth Mark",Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Hitting The Tooth Mark first published in 1973, Moby asks himself, "Why do I have a harpoon cannon?" (informal translation from the following excerpt in German language, "Wozu hab' ich √ºberhaupt eine Harpunierkanone?"), since he realizes that he never used this one for hunting a whale. Moby even joined forces with a female animal rights activist to save a whale belonging to a Scrooge McDuck's enterprise called Sea Kingdom, as seen in the comic story "A Whale's Ransom".Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story A Whale's Ransom Moby is a relative of Donald Duck as seen in "Sea Dog's Holiday" by Vic Lockman and Kay Wright.Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story Sea Dog's Holiday There are American old stories where Moby seems to be familiar to other members of Donald's paternal family as well, like Grandma Duck and Gladstone Gander. In the comic story "The Dread Sea Adventure" by Lockman and Wright,Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story The Dread Sea Adventure Grandma exclaims when she sees Moby, "Moby Duck, you salty old sea biscuit!", making it clear that she knows him very well. Donald was Moby's first mate for a while but he was replaced by Dimwitty Duck (and, on rare occasions in the comic books, by Goofy).

The character does not appear in any stories, but he did partially appear in the 1993 Duck family tree drawn by Don Rosa. In this illustration, Rosa partially concealed the character's face with a bird. While his first name was also hidden, his last name is revealed to be Duck. His face was fully shown in the unofficial Duck family tree by Mark Worden and first published in several fanzines, which labeled him ? Duck and showed him with a flattop haircut and human-like ears. In Huey, Dewey, and Louie's first appearance in a 1937 Donald Duck Sunday strip, Della writes to Donald that the boys had placed a firecracker under their father's chair as a prank and that their father had been sent to the hospital. This was the reason why the boys first showed up at Donald's house. Thereafter the father is generally assumed to have disappeared. In "The Richest Duck in the World", the final installment of The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, when Scrooge mentions that the few family members he had had disappeared, the boys respond "We know how that feels!"
