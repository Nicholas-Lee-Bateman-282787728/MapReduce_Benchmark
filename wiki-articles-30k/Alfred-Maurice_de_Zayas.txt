De Zayas' work into the expulsion of Germans from their areas in East Germany and Eastern Europe at the end of World War II Zayas, Alfred-Maurice de: A Terrible Revenge: The Ethnic Cleansing of the Eastern European Germans 1944–1950, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1994 is credited with bringing this topic to the attention of an English language audience from the 1970s. In 1975, he published a seminal study in the Harvard International Law Journal  questioning the legality of the expulsion of possibly as many as 15 million Germans from their homes after World War II, invoking the Atlantic Charter, the Hague Conventions, and the Nuremberg Principles. The article was followed by the book Nemesis at Potsdam (Routledge und Kegan Paul, 1977) which focused on the degree of responsibility of the British and Americans for decisions leading to the expulsions of these ethnic Germans. In the same year, an enlarged German edition was published by the legal publisher C. H. Beck, becoming a bestseller. In this book, Zayas took an interdisciplinary approach to the phenomenon of "population transfers" and examined the situation of the ethnic Germans from both a historical and legal perspective   De Zayas was reportedly the first American historian to address this topic.[ ]  The Deutsche Welle reported in 2007: "He wrote the first scholarly work on German expellees to appear in English, breaking what had long been a taboo topic." The German Federal Minister Heinrich Windelen wrote in the foreword to Zayas's book Anmerkungen zur Vertreibung: "It is thanks to De Zayas that the debate on The Expulsion has been reopened [...] In the subsequent period, a number of authors have drawn on the work of De Zayas. Thus, he has contributed significantly to the fact that discussion of The Expulsion is no longer considered taboo."Heinrich Windelen, "Foreword" in A. de Zayas, Anmerkungen zur Vertreibung der Deutschen aus dem Osten, W. Kohlhammer, 1993; ISBN 317012580X As law professor at DePaul in Chicago, he organized the exhibit "Ethnic Cleansing 1944–1948", (November 1993–February 1994), consisting of over 100 poster-sized Wochenschau, Bundesarchiv and US-Army Signal Corps pictures, as well as paintings by survivors of the expulsion; it was widely visited, and commented on in the Chicago press.Chicago Sun Times, November 28, 1993.DePaul University Reporter, Vol. VII, No. 5, January 1994, p. 4 The book is cited in scholarly publications and dissertationsDr. Robert Bard, "Historical Memory of the Expulsion of Ethnic Germans in Europe 1944–1947", University of Hertfordshire, July 2009.See also symposium held on July 19, 2005 in Berlin, hosted by the Institut für Zeitgeschichte, with the participation of Dr. Guido Knopp (ZDF), Prof. Soutou (Sorbonne), Prof. Nichols (Oxford) and Alfred de Zayas, pp. 37 et seq.  His second book, The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau was published in Germany by Universitas/Langen Müller, in 1979, and the English translation by de Zayas himself by the University of Nebraska Press in 1989. This describes some of the work of the Wehrmacht-Untersuchungsstelle, a special section of the legal department of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, which investigated Allied and German war crimes. Examples include the murder of Ukrainians in Lviv by the NKVD in 1941, the murder of Polish prisoners of war at Katyn in 1940, executions of German prisoners of war by French irregulars in 1944, and the sinking of the German hospital ship Tübingen by the British in 1944. De Zayas was the first researcher to work with the 226 extantvolumes (about half of the total, the rest apparently having been burned in Langensalza, Germany, near the end of the war.Zayas, Alfred-Maurice de, The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, 1939–1945, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA, 1989, pp. xiii–xiv.). They had been classified documents in the United States and had just been returned by the US National Archives to the German Bundesarchiv. The book was savagely attacked in the media of the Soviet Union and its satellites. Notwithstanding criticism from a few historians in Germany, these two books were well received in the academic community, are used in colleges and universities, and remain in print after thirty years. The book on the Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau was the product of a four-year project financed by the Institute of International Law of the University of Göttingen and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. The final report is available online.  De Zayas was co-President with Jacqueline Berenstein Wavre of the Association Suisses et Internationaux de Genève (1996–2006). ASIG was particularly active in the cultural integration of international civil servants into Geneva life, an activity currently carried out by the "Geneva Welcome Centre" at the Villa la Pastorale in Geneva.

In June 2009, de Zayas published, together with Justice Jakob Th. Möller of Iceland, a handbook called The Case-Law of the United Nations Human Rights Committee 1977–2008. The first chairperson of the Committee, Andreas Mavrommatis, wrote the preface and the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Bertrand Ramcharan, reviewed it in the UN Special of June 2009, pp.&nbsp;18–19: "It is staggering how much the Human Rights Committee has influenced the human rights jurisprudence of the world, as is striking from reading this exceedingly important book.... From the outset of its work in 1977 there have been two Secretariat pioneers in developing the case law of the Committee when it considers petitions from individuals claiming violations of their rights: Jakob Möller (Iceland) and Alfred de Zayas (USA). Möller was the first Chief of the Petitions branch of what is today the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and de Zayas was his colleague, who eventually succeeded him as Chief. ...Every lawyer, every judge, every public-spirited citizen will want to consult this fascinating book, because it tells us what is legally right and legally wrong, how to judge our governments, our societies, our United Nations and ourselves," according to the first review by the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Bertrand Ramcharan  De Zayas co-authored and co-edited International Human Rights Monitoring Mechanisms (with Gudmundur Alfredsson and Bertrand Ramcharan) in 2009. In January 2008, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights placed his name on the public list of candidates for Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council. In 2011, the office of United Nations Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order was established by Human Rights Council resolution 18/6. In 2012, de Zayas was elected as the Independent Expert by the Human Rights Council, after being nominated by the President of the council, Laura Dupuy. He presented his first report to the UN Human Rights Council at its 21st session in September 2012, calling for uniform application of international law.“Apply international law uniformly and not à la carte”, new UN independent expert urges world governments, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human RightsReport of the Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, Alfred-Maurice de Zayas, United Nations Human Rights Council. On November 2, 2012, he presented his interim report to the UN General Assembly in New York. Doc. A/67/277. On 10 September 2013 he presented his second report to the Human Rights Council A/HRC/24/38, and, in October 2013 his second report to the GA . A/68/284, to the UN General Assembly exploring initiatives and enforcement mechanisms to further advance a democratic and equitable international order. On September 10, 2014, his third report, A/HRC/27/51.[99] to the council and On October 27, 2014, he presented his third report to the General Assembly on the right to self-determination (A/69/272)[103][104] In the press release issued the following day, he stated: "The realization of the right of self-determination is essential to maintaining local, regional and international peace and must be seen as an important conflict-prevention strategy".[105]  In 2015, the US based magazine of global politics, Foreign Policy, consulted with the UN Independent Expert on the application of the right to self-determination in the Indonesian region of West Papua.   On 10 September 2015 he presented his fourth report to the Council on the adverse human rights impacts of free trade and investment agreements on a democratic and equitable international order, and on October 26, 2015 to the General Assembly on the issue of investor state dispute settlement.  The main observations of these reports were reported by news outlets such as Reuters, The Guardian, The Huffington Post, Russia Today (RT), and The Independent  During his mandate, de Zayas has addressed multiple contemporary world issues, welcoming the Arms Trade Treaty and urging States to regulate not only trade but also production of arms. For the 2013 World Water Day, he stated that: “With the growth of the world population, the global climate change and the need for a greater healthy environment, access to water resources has become a crucial condition for the realization of a democratic and equitable international order.". For 2013's International Earth Day, he observed: “When we pollute the Earth and waste resources, we violate the rights of future generations and undermine an international order based on democratic participation and equitable sharing of the planet's wealth.” He argues that a change of paradigm is necessary to achieve a just international order: “This vision can be achieved by respecting the United Nations Charter as the World Constitution, by applying international law uniformly and not à la carte, an international democratic order is one where all peoples have the opportunity to participate in global decision-making. We must build on the principles of self-determination, sovereignty, and respect for national identities and universal human dignity."He proposed reforms in the international arena, including in the UN Security Council and the General Assembly, while also stressing that the riches of the planet must be equally shared and not controlled by a few countries or cartels. "Fair trade is possible, as are transfer of knowledge and technical cooperation based on mutual benefit," pointing to the international financial crisis as an indicator of inequality in the international order, and calling for transparency and accountability in the markets, emphasizing that markets cannot be the "private playground of financial bankers", and instead need to understand their role as "a public responsibility." In 2015, following a press release, de Zayas urged trade negotiators to address the Doha Round commitments to promote equal and fair trade at the Tenth Ministerial Conference in Nairobi, Kenya, which was reported by India’s The Hindu. He has also called for the abolition of Investor-State dispute settlement arbitrations that accompany investment agreements stating: “Far from contributing to human rights and development, ISDS has compromised the State’s regulatory functions and resulted in growing inequality among States and within them.”. The Guardian published his op-ed on adverse human rights impacts of free trade and investment agreements. Throughout his mandate period, Dr. de Zayas has lectured on subjects related to his mandate at various academic institutions including the University of Leiden, the University of Leuven, the University of Geneva, the Harvard University, the University of Nottingham, the University of Middlesex, the University of Jaen, and Fachhochschule Zürich. Apart from his scholarly work in the fields of history and law, de Zayas has published poetry in English, French, German, Spanish, and Dutch, has translated the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke into English, French, and Spanish, and has translated works by Joseph von Eichendorff and Hermann Hesse into English.Zayas's translation of Hesse in Bernward Koch-Boehm's CD-recording with Erdenklang/da music, Nr. 61182. Deutsche Austrophon GmbH, D-49356 Diepholdz, 2008, "Montagnola. Dedicated to Hermann Hesse. Meditative Piano Improvisations". As a member of the International Rainer Maria Rilke Society of Sierre, Switzerland, de Zayas published the first English-language translation of Rilke's "Larenopfer", 90 poems dedicated to Rilke's homeland of Bohemia and his home city of PragueLarenopfer, with a historical commentary, Red Hen Press, Los Angeles, 2005; second revised and enlarged edition 2008 with a preface by Professor Ralph Freedman. The new study by George C. Schoolfield "Young Rilke and his Time", Camden House 2009, refers favourably to Zayas's pioneering translation. With this book, Zayas opened a new facet of Rilke research: Rilke as Heimatdichter, or poet of the homeland, poète du terroir – spanning Rilke's early poetry characterized by enthusiasm for the beauties and the history of his homeland through Rilke's final poetic testament – more than 400 poems in French, dedicated to the Valais in Switzerland (Quatrains Valaisains, Roses, Fenêtres, Vergers), Rilke's Wahlheimat, where he spent the last years of his life at the Château de Muzot in Sierre and where he is buried in nearby Raron. Hitherto, Rilke had been understood primarily as a metaphyscial poet, as a poet's poet, but had not been seen as a homeland poet. Zayas has lectured and published on Rilke's search for a sense of belonging and his grateful attachment to a landscape and to the real people who live there. Zayas has lectured on Rilke in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Canada. On May 2, 2011, he delivered a lecture at the Salon du Livre de Genève (Geneva bookfair) on "Rilke, poète de la Heimat""Catalogue of the Geneva Bookfair, L'Agenda", p. 59 He has published in the literary journal of the PEN Club Suisse Romande "L'Escarpe" (renamed 2008 "Pages Littéraires) in 2007-08.
