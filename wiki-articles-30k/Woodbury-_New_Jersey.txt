The now-defunct Woodbury Country Club operated in Woodbury from 1897 to 2010, closing due to declining membership and mounting debt that led to a bankruptcy filing by the club.Conaboy, Chelsea. "Plan would put houses on defunct Woodbury Country Club", The Philadelphia Inquirer, August 23, 2010. Accessed November 12, 2013. "The country club, which was founded in 1897, filed for bankruptcy last summer, citing about $2.88 million in debt, then closed in October. Membership had been declining for years and couldn't support debt from a 1991 renovation." As recounted by the historian William McMahon, the Native Americans called the place where the city of Woodbury was to be founded, "Piscozackasing", or, 'place of the black burrs'. Woodbury was founded in 1683 by Henry Wood, a Quaker from the Northwest of England, who had left Great Britain due to religious persecution. Wood was incarcerated in Lancaster gaol for practicing as a Quaker and left his home in the village of Tottington, near Bury, Lancashire, in a boat to set up a community in the new world where he and his family could practice his religion freely. His surname and his home town went to make up the name of the city he founded – Woodbury.Samuels, Tanyanika. "Following Woodbury's Founder Henry Wood Fled Persecution. Another Wants To Recreate His Journey.", The Philadelphia Inquirer, June 23, 1998. Accessed July 9, 2012.

In 2000, the Borough of Bury, England, and the City of Woodbury were twinned as part of millennium celebrations in both countries. The twinning ceremony was the culmination of a week where more than 300 school children and college students, local dignitaries and local residents from Bury took part in sporting and cultural events held in and around Woodbury with local people. During the week there was a symbolic meeting and reconciliation of the Vicar of Henry Wood's former church in Tottington and the Quaker's meeting house in Woodbury and an ecumenical service attended by many of the residents and visitors.Staff.

"American Dinosaurs." Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs. Edited by Phillip J. Currie and Kevin Padian. Academic Press. p. 10-13. The remains were only retrospectively identified as dinosaurian, as dinosaurs would not be scientifically recognized as a distinct group of reptiles until Sir Richard Owen presented his treatise on British fossil reptiles to the British Association in August 1841. Woodbury was the first city in the United States to mandate recycling. This effort was led by then-councilman and later mayor Donald P. Sanderson in the 1970s, and an ordinance was finally passed in December 1980. The idea of towing a "recycling" trailer behind a trash collection vehicle to enable the collection of trash and recyclable material at the same time emerged. Sanderson was asked to speak in municipalities throughout the country and other towns and cities soon followed suit.Rhodes, Rosalee Polk. "Time as a public servant ends for 'father of recycling' His plan was modeled nationwide. He will retire as mayor.", The Philadelphia Inquirer, December 1, 2002. Accessed July 9, 2012. "Sanderson, a Republican from the city's Third Ward, was referring to the start of Woodbury's recycling program, which eventually would bring accolades from cities across the nation and the world. Initially, it was rebuffed by residents. When Sanderson introduced the curb pickup program in 1980, he said, it almost made him the laughingstock of the town." According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 2.059 square miles (5.333&nbsp;km2), including 2.009 square miles (5.203&nbsp;km2) of land and 0.050 square miles (0.130&nbsp;km2) of water (2.43%).
