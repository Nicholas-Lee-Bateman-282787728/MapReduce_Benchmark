     Thomas Edward "Thom" Yorke (born 7 October 1968) is an English musician best known as the singer and principal songwriter of the alternative rock band Radiohead. As a multi-instrumentalist, Yorke mainly plays guitar and piano, but also plays instruments including keyboards, bass, and drums, and works extensively with synthesisers, sequencers and programming. He is known for his falsetto vocals; in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the 66th greatest singer of all time. Yorke was born in 1968 in Northamptonshire. His family moved often before settling in Oxfordshire, where Yorke attended Abingdon School and founded Radiohead with his schoolmates. After he graduated from the University of Exeter, Radiohead signed to Parlophone; their early hit "Creep" made Yorke a celebrity, and Radiohead have gone on to achieve critical acclaim and sales of over 30 million albums.Jonathan, Emma. "BBC Worldwide takes exclusive Radiohead performance to the world". BBC. 3 May 2011. Retrieved 15 June 2011. Their fourth album Kid A (2000) saw Yorke and the band move into electronic music, often manipulating his vocals. In 2006, Yorke released his debut solo album, The Eraser, comprising mainly electronic music. In 2009, to perform The Eraser live, he formed Atoms for Peace with musicians including Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich; in 2013, the band released an album, Amok. In 2014, Yorke released his second solo album, Tomorrow's Modern Boxes. He has collaborated with artists including DJ Shadow, Björk, Flying Lotus and PJ Harvey, and has composed soundtracks for documentaries and theatre. With artist Stanley Donwood, he creates artwork for Radiohead's albums. Yorke has been critical of the music industry, particularly of major labels and streaming services such as Spotify, which he believes cannot support new music. With Radiohead and his solo work he has pioneered alternative music release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent. He is a human rights, environmental, and anti-war activist, and his lyrics often address political themes. Yorke was born on 7 October 1968, in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. He was born with a paralysed left eye, and underwent five eye operations by the age of six;Randall, p. 19 according to Yorke, the last surgery was "botched", giving him a drooping eyelid. Yorke's family moved frequently. His father, a nuclear physicist and later a chemical equipment salesman, was hired by a firm in Scotland shortly after his son's birth; the family lived there until Yorke was seven, and he moved from school to school.Randall, p. 21 The family settled in Oxfordshire in 1978.  Yorke received his first guitar when he was seven; his earliest musical inspiration was guitarist Brian May of Queen. At 10, he made his own guitar, inspired by May's Red Special. By 11, he had joined his first band and written his first song.Randall, p. 23 In Oxford he attended the boys' public school Abingdon, where he met Ed O'Brien, Phil Selway, and brothers Colin and Jonny Greenwood;Randall, p. 26–33 they formed a band named On a Friday, named for the only day they were allowed to rehearse. Yorke said: "School was bearable for me because the music department was separate from the rest of the school. It had pianos in tiny booths, and I used to spend a lot of time hanging around there after school." After leaving school, Yorke took a gap year, during which he worked a few jobs and was involved in a car accident that influenced the lyrics of Radiohead songs, including the Bends B-side "Killer Cars" and "Airbag" from OK Computer.Randall, p. 38–39 In late 1988, Yorke left Oxford to study at the University of Exeter, which put On a Friday on hiatus aside from holiday break rehearsals.Randall, p. 43 Yorke said he had "wanted to go to St John's to read English, because that's what everybody did. But I was told I couldn't even apply – I was too thick. Oxford University would have eaten me up and spat me out. It's too rigorous." At Exeter, he worked as a DJ, performed experimental music with a classical ensemble, and played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material. He also met artist Stanley Donwood, with whom Yorke collaborates to produce artwork for Radiohead albums, and printmaker Rachel Owen, with whom he was in a relationship for over two decades.Randall, p. 52   On A Friday resumed activity in 1991 as most of the members were finishing their degrees. They signed to Parlophone and changed their name to Radiohead. According to Yorke, around this time he "hit the self-destruct button pretty quickly": he cut his hair and drank heavily, often becoming too drunk to perform.Randall, p.87 Radiohead gained notice with the worldwide hit single "Creep", which later appeared on the band's 1993 debut album Pablo Honey. Yorke said that the success inflated his ego; he tried to project himself as a rock star, which included bleaching his hair and wearing extensions. He said: "When I got back to Oxford I was unbearable ... as soon as you get any success you disappear up your own arse."Randall, p. 120 By the time of Radiohead's second album, The Bends (1995), Radiohead had attracted a large fanbase and began to receive critical acclaim. After the album's release, the American rock band R.E.M., a major influence on Radiohead, picked them as their support act for their European tour.Randall, p. 177 Yorke and R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe became friends; Stipe gave him advice about how to deal with fame.randall, p. 178 During the production of the band's third album, OK Computer (1997), all five members of Radiohead had differing opinions and equal production roles, with Yorke having "the loudest voice", according to O'Brien.Randall, p. 195 OK Computer achieved critical acclaim and strong sales, establishing Radiohead as one of the leading alternative rock acts of the 1990s, but Yorke was ambivalent about their success. Following the OK Computer tour, he suffered a mental breakdown, and said: "Every time I picked up a guitar I just got the horrors. I would start writing a song, stop after 16 bars, hide it away in a drawer, look at it again, tear it up, destroy it." He began to listen almost exclusively to the electronic music of Warp artists such as Aphex Twin and Autechre, saying: "It was refreshing because the music was all structures and had no human voices in it. But I felt just as emotional about it as I'd ever felt about guitar music." Yorke and Radiohead took these influences to their albums Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), processing vocals, obscuring lyrics, and incorporating electronic, jazz and avant-garde classical influences. The albums divided fans and critics, but were commercially successful and later attracted widespread critical acclaim; at the turn of the decade, Kid A was named the best album of the 2000s by Rolling Stone and Pitchfork. In 2003, Radiohead released their sixth album, Hail to the Thief, a blend of rock and electronic music; Yorke wrote many of its lyrics in response to the War on Terror and the resurgence of right-wing politics in the west after the turn of the millennium.  It was the final album recorded under Radiohead's contract with EMI. In 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows, as a pay-what-you-want download, the first for a major act; the release made headlines worldwide and sparked debate about the implications for the music industry. In 2011, Radiohead self-released their eighth album, The King of Limbs, which Yorke described as "an expression of physical movements and wildness".  Yorke released his debut solo album The Eraser in 2006 on the independent label XL Recordings. Composed of electronic music Yorke recorded during Radiohead's 2004 hiatus, the album was produced by Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich and features artwork by Donwood. Yorke said: "I've been in the band since we left school and never dared do anything on my own&nbsp;... It was like, 'Man, I've got to find out what it feels like,' you know?" He emphasised that Radiohead were not splitting up and that the album was made "with their blessing". The Eraser received positive reviews and reached number 3 in the UK in its first week, number 2 in the United States, Canada and Australia, and number 9 in Ireland. It was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize and the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. An album of remixes by various artists, The Eraser Rmxs, was released in 2009. In July 2009, Yorke performed solo at the Latitude Festival in England. On 21 September 2009, he released a double-A-side single, "Feeling Pulled Apart by Horses" / "The Hollow Earth". In 2010, he performed a surprise set at Glastonbury Festival with Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, performing Eraser and Radiohead songs. In 2012, he contributed music to a Rag & Bone fashion show. In September 2014, Yorke released his second solo album, Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, via BitTorrent. It received positive reviews and became the most torrented album of 2014 (excluding piracy), with over a million downloads in its first six days. On 26 December 2014, Yorke released the album via Bandcamp along with a new single, "Youwouldn'tlikemewhenI'mangry". In 2015, he performed with Godrich at the Latitude Festival in the UK and the Summer Sonic Festival in Japan.   In 2009, Yorke formed Atoms for Peace to perform songs from his first solo album The Eraser. Alongside Yorke on vocals, guitar and keyboards, the band comprises bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, drummer Joey Waronker of Beck and R.E.M., percussionist Mauro Refosco of Forro in the Dark and Godrich on keyboards and guitar. Yorke said: "God love 'em but I've been playing with the same band since I was 16, and to do this was quite a trip&nbsp;... It felt like we'd knocked a hole in a wall, and we should just fucking go through it." The band played eight North American shows in 2010. In February 2013, they released an album, Amok, on XL Recordings. It was followed by a tour of Europe, the US and Japan. Answering a fan question on Reddit, Yorke wrote that determining whether new songs were for Radiohead or Atoms for Peace was "a grey area. Getting greyer. Obviously depends on who is being sampled." For the soundtrack of the 1998 film Velvet Goldmine, Yorke covered Roxy Music songs with the band Venus in Furs. In 2013, Yorke and other artists contributed music to The UK Gold, a documentary about tax avoidance in the UK. The soundtrack was released free in February 2015 through the online audio platform SoundCloud. In 2015, Yorke contributed a soundtrack, Subterranea, to an installation of Radiohead artwork, The Panic Office, in Sydney, Australia. The soundtrack is composed of field recordings made in the English countryside, and plays in the installation on speakers at different heights playing different frequency ranges. The Australian radio station Triple J described the soundtrack as "closest in tone and style to the more ambient moments of Tomorrow's Modern Boxes", with some digitally spoken sections similar to "Fitter Happier" from Radiohead's OK Computer. There are no plans to release the music. Yorke composed music for a 2015 production of Harold Pinter's 1971 play Old Times by the Roundabout Theater Company in New York City. The play's director described the music as "primeval, unusual&nbsp;... the sort of neurosis within [Yorke's] music certainly has elucidated elements of the compulsive repetition of the play."  Yorke has worked with producer Nigel Godrich and artist Stanley Donwood on every Radiohead album since The Bends, as well as his solo work and work with Atoms for Peace. Describing his collaborative process with Godrich, Yorke said: "[The Eraser song] 'Black Swan', back in the day, was a six-minute load of crap. Except for this one juicy bit, and [Godrich] goes past and goes, 'That bit. Fuck the rest.' Usually it's something like that." Yorke wrote of meeting Donwood at university: "He had a better hat and suit on than me. That pissed me off. So I figured I'd either end up really not liking this person at all, or working with him for the rest of my life." Donwood said his first impression of Yorke was that he was "mouthy. Pissed off. Someone I could work with." Yorke is credited for artwork alongside Donwood under the monikers "The White Chocolate Farm", "Tchock", "Dr. Tchock" or similar abbreviations. In 1998, Yorke appeared on "Rabbit in Your Headlights" on the UNKLE album Psyence Fiction, a cover of the 1975 Pink Floyd song Wish You Were Here with Sparklehorse, and duetted on "El President" with Isabel Monteiro of Drugstore. In 2000, he duetted with PJ Harvey on "This Mess We're In" and contributed backing vocals to her album Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea, and appeared on Björk's soundtrack album Selmasongs, singing on the Oscar-nominated song "I've Seen It All". In 2004, he and Jonny Greenwood contributed to the Band Aid 20 single "Do They Know It's Christmas?", produced by Godrich. In 2008, Yorke sang backing vocals on Björk's charity single "Náttúra". In 2009, Yorke recorded a cover of the Miracle Legion song "All for the Best" with his brother Andy for the compilation Ciao My Shining Star: The Songs of Mark Mulcahy. Yorke provided vocals for the Flying Lotus tracks "...And the World Laughs with You" from Cosmogramma (2010) and "Electric Candyman" from Until the Quiet Comes (2012), and the Modeselektor tracks "The White Flash" from Happy Birthday (2007) and "Shipwreck" and "This" from Monkeytown (2011). In 2011, he collaborated with electronic artists Burial and Four Tet on the tracks "Ego" and "Mirror". 2011, Yorke, Jonny Greenwood and MF DOOM collaborated on the track "Retarded Fren". In February 2012, Yorke remixed "Hold On" by SBTRKT under the name Sisi BakBak; his identity was not confirmed until September 2014. In July 2015, he joined Portishead on stage at the UKLatitude Festival to perform their 2007 song "The Rip". Yorke is a multi-instrumentalist; his main instruments are guitar, piano (including Rhodes piano) and keyboards, though he has performed other instruments including bass and drums. He has worked extensively with electronic instruments such as synthesisers, drum machines, and sequencers, and techniques including programming, sampling and looping. Nonetheless, in 2015 Yorke said: "Really I just enjoy writing words sitting at a piano. I tend to lose interest in the drum machine." As a teenager, Yorke's favourite artists included Queen, Joy Division, R.E.M., Siousxie and the Banshees and Bob Dylan. He wrote that Mark Mulcahy of Miracle Legion had affected him "a great deal" at this time: "It was the voice of someone who was only truly happy when he was singing&nbsp;... it changed the way I thought about songs and singing." He has cited the Pixies, Björk and PJ Harvey as artists who "changed his life", and in 2006 he told Pitchfork that Radiohead had "ripped off R.E.M. blind for years". In 2013, Yorke named the electronic artist Aphex Twin as his biggest influence, saying: "He burns a heavy shadow&nbsp;... Aphex opened up another world that didn't involve my fucking electric guitar&nbsp;... I hated all the music that was around Radiohead at the time, it was completely fucking meaningless. I hated the Britpop thing and what was happening in America, but Aphex was totally beautiful, and he's kind of my age too." Unlike his bandmate Jonny Greenwood, Yorke has never learned how to read sheet music, feeling "you can't express the rhythms properly like that. It's a very ineffective way of doing it, so I've never really bothered picking it up." Yorke is known for his falsetto, which Paste Magazine described as "sweet and cautious" and "haunting".<ref>{{Cite web|title = 11 Amazing Falsetto Vocalists|url = http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2011/09/11-amazing-falsetto-vocalists.html?p=2|accessdate = 26 April 2015}}</ref>'' Rolling Stone ''described his voice as a "broad, emotive sweep" with a "high, keening sound".<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite news | title = 100 Greatest Singers of All Time| publisher = Rolling Stone| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/thom-yorke-20101202  | accessdate = 21 February 2009}}</ref> In 2006, Yorke said: "It annoys me how pretty my voice is&nbsp;... how polite it can sound when perhaps what I'm singing is deeply acidic."<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|title=With Radiohead, and Alone, the Sweet Malaise of Thom Yorke|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/arts/music/02pare.html|accessdate=27 September 2008|first=Jon|last=Pareles|date=2 July 2006}}</ref> Based on his recorded works, he has a vocal range spanning from E2 to E6.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Axl Rose has a larger vocal range than Mariah Carey|url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10848713/Axl-Rose-has-a-larger-vocal-range-than-Mariah-Carey.html|accessdate = 26 April 2015}}</ref>   Yorke has often manipulated his vocals with effects, transforming his voice into a "disembodied instrument".<ref name="rollingstone" /> In 2013, he said: "Whenever I'm building anything, whether it's on a laptop or drum machine or whatever&nbsp;... there's always a vocal going in the back of my head.
