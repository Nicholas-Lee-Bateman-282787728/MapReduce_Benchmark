     Mount Greylock is the highest natural point in Massachusetts at . Its peak is located in the northwest corner of the state in the western part of the town of Adams (near its border with Williamstown) in Berkshire County. Although geologically part of the Taconic Mountains, Mount Greylock is commonly associated with the abutting Berkshire Hills to the east. The mountain is known for its expansive views encompassing five states and the only taiga-boreal forest in the state. A seasonal automobile road (open annually from late May through November 1) climbs to the summit, where stands the iconic  lighthouse-like Massachusetts Veterans War Memorial Tower. A network of hiking trails traverse the mountain, including the  Appalachian Trail. Mount Greylock State Reservation was created in 1898 as Massachusetts' first public land for the purpose of forest preservation. Geographically, Mount Greylock is part of an  by  island-like range that runs north-south between the Hoosac Range to the east, the Green Mountains to the north, the Berkshires to both the south and east, and the Taconic Mountains to the west with which it is geologically associated;  all ranges are associated with the Appalachian mountain chain. The summit of Mount Greylock is located in Adams, Massachusetts, but the mountain also extends into Cheshire, Lanesborough, New Ashford, North Adams and Williamstown. The range includes peaks with elevation less than Greylock, such as Saddle Ball Mountain and Mount Fitch.  On average, Mount Greylock rises  above surrounding river valleys and  above the Berkshires and Taconic Mountains. From the summit, views of up to  are possible into five different states: Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire. The northwest side of Mount Greylock drains into the Green River, then into the Hoosic River, Hudson River, and New York Harbor. The south side of the mountain drains into Town Brook, then into the Housatonic River and Long Island Sound. The rest of the mountain drains into the Hoosic River.  Mount Greylock and the neighboring Taconic Mountains are comprised predominately of Ordovician phyllite, a metamorphic rock, overlain on younger layers of metamorphized sedimentary rock, especially marble. Mount Greylock is the product of thrust faulting, a tectonic process by which older rock is thrust up and above younger rock during periods of intense mountain building. The younger, underlying marble bedrock layers have been quarried in the lower foothills of the mountain in nearby Adams and North Adams, Massachusetts. During the Pleistocene, 18,000 years ago, Mount Greylock and the surrounding region were covered by the Laurentide ice sheet up to {{convert|1|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} in thickness. Glaciation rounded and wore down the mountain, carving out U-shaped valleys and leaving [[glacial erratics]] such as the Balanced Rock in Laneborough on the west side of Greylock.<ref>http://www.stateparks.com/balance_rock_state_park_in_massachusetts.html</ref> The Hopper, a [[cirque]], also located on the west side of Greylock, is the southernmost such glacial feature in New England.<ref name="Raymo"/><ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://drm.williams.edu/nhb/|title=Natural History of the Berkshires|publisher=[[Williams College]]|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref>  ===Forests and old growth=== [[File:Picea rubens UGA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Red Spruce on Mount Greylock]] During the 19th century, much of the mountain was denuded by logging, fires, and grazing. Forests have since reclaimed the mountain. Several forest communities exist on Mount Greylock. Lower slopes are inhabited by [[northern hardwood forest]] species while upper summits are dominated by boreal [[balsam fir]] and [[red spruce]]. The ridgeline of Greylock, between Mount Fitch on the north and Saddle Ball on the south, is the only place in Massachusetts where a [[taiga]]-[[boreal forest|boreal]] or sub-alpine forest flourishes. Researchers have identified {{convert|555|acre|km2}} of [[old growth]] forest on the mountain. The steep western slopes (which include The Hopper) contain northern hardwood forest [[biome]] species up to 350 years old, including a {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} red spruce. Because of its extensive stands of red spruce old growth, The Hopper has been designated a [[National Natural Landmark]].<ref name="dcr3">{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dcr/massparks/region-west/mount-greylock-state-reservation-nature-and-science.html |title=Nature and Science |work=MassParks: Mount Greylock State Reservation |publisher=Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, Department of Conservation and Recreation |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref><ref name = "OldGrowthEastUS"> {{cite web | url         = http://www.primalnature.org/ogeast/survey.html | archiveurl         = http://www.webcitation.org/5yZFzec0P | archivedate         = 2011-05-10 | title       = Old Growth in the East: A Survey | accessdate  = 2008-12-31 | author      = Mary Byrd Davis | date        = 23 January 2008 }} </ref>  Mount Greylock is designated as an [[important bird area]] (IBA).  There are a number of species of birds which breed in the taiga or boreal forests at the higher altitudes of the mountain, which are not normally found breeding in Massachusetts.

The traditional trade route connecting the tribes of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Connecticut River]] valleys (today, [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]], known as the [[Mohawk Trail]]) passes beneath the northern flank of Mount Greylock.  The mountain was known to 18th century English settlers as ''Grand Hoosuc(k)''. In the early 19th century it was called ''Saddleback Mountain'' because of its appearance (Saddle Ball, the name of the peak to the south, still reflects this).<ref name="B">{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshireweb.com/mohawktrail/mtgreylock.html|title=Mount Greylock State Reservation|publisher=The BerkshireWeb|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>  [[File:Timothy Dwight IV.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Timothy Dwight IV]]]] The origin of the present name of Greylock and its association with the mountain is unclear. It first appeared in print about 1819, and came into popular use by the 1830s. It may be in reference to its appearance, as it often has a gray cloud, or lock of gray mist upon his head, or in tribute to a legendary [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] chief, [[Gray Lock]].<ref name="B"/> Gray Lock (c. 1670-1750) was a Western [[Abenaki]] Missisquoi chief of Woronoco-[[Pocomtuc]] ancestry, born near [[Westfield, Massachusetts]]. Gray Lock distinguished himself by conducting [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] raids into Vermont and western Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Western Abenakis of Vermont, 1600-1800: War, Migration, and the survival of an Indian people|first=Colin G.|last=Calloway|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1990}}</ref>  [[Timothy Dwight IV]], President of Yale University, along with Williams College President Ebenezer Fitch, climbed Greylock in 1799, probably over a rough route cut by a local pioneer farmer Jeremiah Wilbur (in that time more land had been cleared on the slopes for farming than today). His account in ''Travels in New England and New York'' describes the experience, although he noted the summit vegetation was so thick he and Fitch had to climb a [[balsam fir]] tree to get a better view: {{cquote|(Saddle Back) is the highest land in the state […] Its southeastern front is extensively visible throughout Berkshire, and from high elevations in the states of New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, and Connecticut at very great distances […] During a great part of the year, it is either embosomed or capped by clouds, and indicates to the surrounding inhabitants the changes of weather with not a little exactness.<ref>Dwight, Timothy IV (Reprinted 1969) ''Travels in New England and New York'' Ed.

On May 12, 1830, a group of students directed by college President Edward Dorr Griffin improved and further cut a trail from the end of the Hopper Road to the summit. Today this route is the Hopper Trail, traditionally climbed by students once a year on [[Mountain Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.williams.edu/williamshistory/mountain-day.php |title=Mountain Day |first=Brian|last=Van Wyck|publisher=Williams College Archives and Special Collections|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>  In May 1831 the first wooden [[meteorology|meteorological]] observatory, "Griffin's Tower", was built on the summit by students. Nine years later, it was replaced by a more substantial 60-foot (20 m) tall wooden observatory tower, from which [[Donati's Comet]] was photographed in 1858. In 1863 the first organized hiking and nature study club in the United States, the ''Alpine Club'', was founded by Professor Albert Hopkins.

Thoreau summited and spent a night in July 1844. His account of this event in ''[[A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers]]'' described his approach up what is today the Bellows Pipe Trail. Scholars contend that this Greylock experience transformed him, affirming his ability to do these excursions on his own, following his brother John's death; and served as a prelude to his experiment of rugged individualism at [[Walden Pond]] the following year in 1845.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thoreau|first1=Henry David|last2=Howarth|first2=William L.|year=1983|title=Thoreau In The Mountains: Writings By Henry David Thoreau|location=New York|publisher=Farrar, Straus, Giroux|isbn=0-374-27643-9}}</ref>  By the late 19th century, [[clearcutting]] [[logging]] practices had stripped much of the mountain for local industries that produced wood products, [[paper]] and [[charcoal]].

The GPA also undertook long-needed repairs to the Notch Road so that carriages could access the top.

Legislation was filed by William H. Chase, editor of the Berkshire Sunday Democrat of North Adams, under the auspices of the Board of Trade of North Adams to transfer the GPA land holdings on the mountain to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for a state reservation. This included supporting testimony from Williams College geology professor T. Nelson Dale, and a $25,000 appropriation bill filed through Judge Arthur M. Robinson.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Springfield Sunday Republican|date=1898-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Springfield Republican|date=1898-03-03}}</ref> Additional support came from the Massachusetts Forestry Association's initiative to advocate for the establishment of a state park system, and to make the case point, fight inappropriate development of the state's highest peak, Mount Greylock. The principal argument for making the mountain a public reservation was to protect the [[Hoosic River|Hoosic]] and [[Housatonic River]] watersheds from erosion due to recent trends of deforestation (particularly noted on the Adams side). Another concern was to preserve it for the public rather than private and exclusive enjoyment. On June 20, 1898 Mount Greylock State Reservation was created, with the stipulation that the state add to the original land (to ultimately total {{convert|10000|acre|km2|abbr=on}}). With this acquisition the first public land in Massachusetts for the purpose of forest preservation was created, later to become the state park system. A three-person, governor-appointed Greylock Reservation Commission, a body of Berkshire County government, was entrusted with the care and maintenance of the reservation. The title "Reservation" refers to county management of state land, since there was only one state forester and a handful of state fire wardens in service at the time; similarly other early State Reservation properties in Massachusetts were previously managed and operated by county commissions for the state.<ref name="DCR2">{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dcr/massparks/region-west/mount-greylock-state-reservation-history-and-culture-massachusetts-first-state-park.html |title=Massachusetts' First State Park |work=MassParks: Mount Greylock State Reservation |publisher=Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, Department of Conservation and Recreation |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>  ===The 20th century=== In 1906, Berkshire County began survey and construction of another approach, the first direct route from the south to the summit.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/actsResolves/1906/1906acts0419.pdf |title=Acts and Resolves Passed by the General Court of Massachusetts 1906 |chapter=Chapter 419 |publisher=The State Library of Massachusetts |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}</ref> It was opened to the public on September 16, 1907, running "through six farms ... passing Round’s Rock, a fine view point, and throughout its entire distance affords unsurpassed views of Berkshire hills and valleys lying to the south and west of the reservation".<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Berkshire County Eagle|date=1907-09-17}}</ref> Afterwards the Commission turned its attention to the foot trail development, and by 1913 it was able to boast that 17 trails existed on the mountain.

The Thunderbolt Ski Runners have continued the tradition of an annual backcountry ski race each winter, conditions permitting.<ref>http://www.thunderboltskirun.com/history.html</ref> As a result, the Trail has experienced an increasing number of backcounty skiers during the winter months.  ===Broadcast towers=== Three radio and television stations transmit from a broadcast tower below the summit on the west side: [[WAMC]] (90.3 [[Albany, New York]]); [[WTEN|WCDC-TV]] (19/36 [[Adams, Massachusetts]]); and W38DL (38 [[Adams, Massachusetts]] (Repeater of [[WNYT-TV]]). A [[NOAA]] Weather Radio station (WWF-48, 162.525&nbsp;MHz) broadcasts from a different tower on the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/stations.php?State=MA|publisher = NOAA|title=NWR Station Listings for Massachusetts|date=2009-10-03}}</ref>  ==See also== {{portal|Geography|North America||United States|Massachusetts|Mountains}} *[[Outline of Massachusetts]] *[[Index of Massachusetts-related articles]] *[[List of U.S. states by elevation]] *[[List of old growth forests in Massachusetts]] {{clear}}  == References == {{reflist|2}}  == External links == {{commons}} *[http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dcr/massparks/region-west/mt-greylock-state-reservation-generic.html Mount Greylock State Reservation] Department of Conservation and Recreation *[http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dcr/parks/trails/greytrailmiles.pdf Hiking Trail Mileages, Mount Greylock State Reservation] Department of Conservation and Recreation *[http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dcr/parks/mtgreylock/birdsofgreylockguidelist.pdf Birds of Mount Greylock] Department of Conservation and Recreation *[http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dcr/parks/mtgreylock/wildflowers.pdf Wildflowers of Mount Greylock] Department of Conservation and Recreation *[http://www.bascomlodge.net/ Bascom Lodge] *[http://www.thunderboltskirun.com/ Thunderbolt Ski Run], an alpine racing trail from the 1930s still used recreationally today * [http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2569/ Mount Greylock Scenic Byway] * [http://www.nelsap.org/ma/greylock1.html Mt.
