      Clube de Regatas do Flamengo (from DutchThe name "Flamengo" is a literal license in Dutch language of the Dutch substantive vlamingen (Flemish people in English language). vlamingen: Flemish people, English: Flamengo Regatta Club), commonly referred to as Flamengo (), is a Brazilian sports club based in Rio de Janeiro. Their most significant sporting outlet is the football team, which plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Brazil's national league, and is one of the only five clubs to have never been relegated to the second division, along with Santos, São Paulo, Internacional and Cruzeiro. The club was established in 1895, although it did not play its first official game until 1912. Flamengo is one of the most successful clubs in Brazilian football, it has won six Campeonato Brasileiro Série A titles and three Copa do Brasil titles. Due to its low capacity, Flamengo's home stadium, Gávea, hasn't been used in official matches since 1997 and the club usually opts for Maracanã, the biggest football stadium in Brazil, with a capacity of 78,838. Its traditional playing colors are red and black hooped shirts with white shorts and red and black hooped socks. The most prestigious laurel in South American football, the team, subsequently known as the Geração de Ouro, defeated Cobreloa 2–0 in the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo to became champions of America. That same year, Flamengo became world champions after defeating Liverpool 3–0 in Tokyo. Flamengo is the most popular team in Brazil, with over 39,1 million supporters as of 2010, and was voted by FIFA as one of the most successful football clubs of the 20th century. It is also one of Brazil's richest football clubs in terms of revenue, with an annual revenue of R$347.0 million ($130.06 million/€107.5 million) in 2014, and the second most valuable club in South America, worth over R$855.4 million ($424.4 million/€327.9 million) in 2013. The club has long-standing rivalries with near neighbors Fluminense, Botafogo and Vasco da Gama. There is also an interstate rivalry with Atlético Mineiro.   Flamengo was founded on November 17, 1895 (although the club celebrates its founding every year on November 15, which is also a Brazilian national holiday) as a rowing club by José Agostinho Pereira da Cunha, Mário Spindola, Nestor de Barros, Augusto Lopes, José Félix da Cunha Meneses and Felisberto Laport. The group used to gather at Café Lamas, in the Flamengo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, and decided to form a rowing team. Rowing was the elite sport in Rio de Janeiro in the late 19th century. The young men hoped that forming a rowing club, would make them popular, with the young ladies of the city's high society. They could only afford a used boat named "Pherusa", which had to be completely rebuilt before it could be used in competition. The team debuted on October 6, 1895 when they sailed off the Caju Point, from the Maria Angu beach, heading off to Flamengo beach. However, strong winds turned over the boat and the rowers nearly drowned. They were rescued by a fishing boat named Leal ("Loyal"). Afterwards, as the Pherusa was undergoing repairs, the boat was stolen and never again found. The group then had to save up money to buy a new boat, the "Etoile", renamed "Scyra".  On the night of November 17, the group, gathered at Nestor de Barros's manor on Flamengo beach, founded the Flamengo Rowing Group ("Grupo de Regatas do Flamengo", in Portuguese) and elected its first board and president (Domingos Marques de Azevedo). The name was changed a few weeks later to "Clube de Regatas do Flamengo" ("Flamengo Rowing Club"). The founders also decided that the anniversary of the club foundation should be celebrated on November 15, so as to coincide with the Day of the Republic, a national holiday. Flamengo only embraced football when a group of dissatisfied players from Fluminense Football Club broke away from the club following a dispute with the board. The players (Alberto Borgerth, Othon de Figueiredo Baena, Píndaro de Carvalho Rodrigues, Emmanuel Augusto Nery, Ernesto Amarante, Armando de Almeida, Orlando Sampaio Matos, Gustavo Adolpho de Carvalho, Lawrence Andrews and Arnaldo Machado Guimarães) decided to join Flamengo because Borgerth, who was the team's captain, was also a rower for Flamengo. Admittance of the new members was approved on November 8, 1911. A motion against the club taking part in football tournaments was defeated, and the members assembly officially created the football team on December 24, 1911. The new team used to train on Russel beach, and gradually gained the support of the locals, who closely watched their practice games. The first official match was played on May 3, 1912 and is, to this day, the most spectacular victory of the club, as the team defeated Mangueira 16 to 2. The first intracity rivalry, the Flamengo vs. Fluminense aka Fla-Flu was Fla-Flu (which would eventually become one of the most famous football derbies in the world) was also played in that year, on July 7, and was won by Fluminense, by 3–2. On The Beach from Russell had the first training and on May 3, 1912, properly joined the Metropolitan League of Land Sports, the squadron held its first match. Was in the field of America and the Rossoneri won the hose by 16–2, and the judge was consecrated Belfort Duarte. The Crimson-black frame with graduated Baena; Pindar and Nery; Coriol, Gilberto and Rooster; Baiano, Arnaldo, Amarante, Gustavo and Borgerth. Already in 1912, the Mengão won his first title in football, the Carioca Championship Football Table 2. The first uniform was called "parrot Jeep", but in 1914 the club adopted the shirt coral snake (which only lasted until 1916) and won his first state championship and the second the following year. In 1921, Flamengo Rio won his second championship, and in 1925, won six titles in professional football, a record until then. In 1927 he was voted "most beloved club in Brazil", leading to Salutaris Cup winning a contest in the Jornal do Brazil. in 1930, however, the Flemish had his worst school in one year in football. in 1933 the team made its first tour outside Brazil and the day May 14 of the same year made his last game as an amateur, winning the River by 16–2. With the election of President José Bastos Padilha in 1934, the club was able to improve the social part, grew in popularity, and in 1936, came players like Domingos da Guia and Leonidas da Silva (which would become the first leading scorer in a World Cup selection by canary in the FIFA World Cup in 1938, when he was player of Flamengo). The year 1937 was a novelty in the Flamengo football, it was the coming of the coach Dori Kruschner, which implemented a new game plan known as WM and training without a ball. Another innovation was the inclusion of the second uniform in order to facilitate the vision of the players in night games since the lighting was not ideal. In the same year came the unification of the Carioca championship with the creation of the Carioca League Football, every club had already deployed professionalism. In 1939, after 12 years of fasting, the Most Wanted came back to win the state championship with the team that will become the basis for state tricampeonato in the 40s. In 1941, the group played its first international competition, the Hexagonal Tournament of Argentina. In 1942 was founded the first organized supporters of Brazil, Charanga Crimson-Black, and in 1944, Flamengo won his first Rio tricampeonato (1942-43-44). the main event in 1946 was the fracture player Zizinho, a major Brazilian superstars of the era and revealed by Flamengo himself, who embezzled the team for six months, doing -a lose a lot of quality in the field. Zizinho was sold in 1950 to the Bangu, considered one of the worst deals in the history of Mengo. In 1955, the Mengão Rio won his second hat-trick.  Despite the achievements of this period Fla is further restricting the regional level, the club had in its cast players like Dida, Paulo César "Cashew", Gershon (Revealed by Flamengo), Rondinelli, Horacio Doval, "Fio Maravilha", Evaristo de Macedo, Reyes, among others, that strengthened the teams assembled in the period. In 1961, the team became champion of the Rio-São Paulo Tournament, which at the time was a title that was worth much more than a simple rivalry between São Paulo and Rio. After the state tricampeonato in 1955, the headline was only conquered in 1963 and later in 1965 in late 1968, Garrincha was hired and has started to play for Flamengo, but the expectation that he could play the entire following season failed. He made his last appearance for Flamengo in April 12, 1969, with 20 games and 4 goals scored. The greatest legacy of the club in the 1970s was to reveal to the world the most successful football team Flamengo. During that time players like Zico, Junior, Leandro Andrade and others as important, have risen to the professional team Flamengo. In 1970, the club won its first Guanabara Cup (1st round of the state tournament). In the first five months of 1971, the Flemish situation was not good, under the command of Yustrich, only won 28 games 8. in 1972 again won the Guanabara Cup and Campeonato Carioca, in 1973 also won the first round of the state championship.  In 1978 a scarlet-black golden age began when Flamengo won the Rio de Janeiro State Championship. The five following years would be years of glory. Stars such as Júnior, Carpegiani, Adílio, Cláudio Adão and Tita were led by Zico to become State Champions three times in a row. The level of sustained excellence pushed Flamengo towards its first Brazilian Championship in 1980. Then, as national champions, the club qualified to play the South American continental tournament – the Libertadores Cup. 1981 is a benchmark year in Flamengo's history. After beating Chilean Cobreloa in three matches, the club became South American Champions. The next goal was clear: the Intercontinental Cup, a single match to be played in Tokyo's Olympic Stadium, Japan, against European Champions' Cup winner Liverpool FC. On December 13, 1981, Raul, Leandro, Marinho, Mozer, Júnior, Andrade, Adílio, Zico, Tita, Nunes and Lico took the field for the most important match in club history. Two goals by Nunes and another one by Adílio (all during first half) along with a brilliant performance by Zico were more than enough to crown Flamengo the first Brazilian World Champions club since Pelé's Santos, shutting out Liverpool 3–0. The next two years would also be great. Another Rio's State Championship in 1981 and two Brazilian Championships – 1982 and 1983 – closed the Golden Age in a fantastic way. Two years later, Zico returned to the club in 1986 and won its last state championship. This year he participated in a few games, since a game in 1985 against the State he was the victim of a violent player input Márcio Nunes, running out of play for a long time due to the long period of recovery from surgery. However, in the opening match of the following State, scored three of the four goals in Flamengo's 4–1 victory over Fluminense. In 1987, was a major contributor to the achievement of the first edition of the Copa União (called by the Brazilian Football Confederation green module), considered at the time by much of the press and at the 13 Club as the national tetracampeonato Flamengo . highlights are the victories in the semi-finals matches against oea final against, which was won with a goal from Bebeto. the Club of 13, and consequently the Flemish and international, have not accepted the intersection established by the CBF between the first two modules of green and yellow, losing their games by forfeit the CBF then officiated as the Brazilian champion and 1987 runner-up that year. on February 21, 2011, by Resolution No. 02/2011 presidency of CBF, officiated as Brazilian champion Flamengo 1987 Sport side of the door. However, in June 2011, had to withdraw following the decision of the Court of the 10th Federal Court of First Instance of the Judicial Section of Pernambuco, returning to the Sport acknowledge as the only Brazilian champion of professional football in 1987 on June 28, 2012, in manual, CBF recognized the title of the Brazilian Flamengo 1987. Then she backtracked and said that in the manual, there was a "huge mistake" which she sent to an outdated graphical material where Flamengo was considered champion 1987 side of the Sport. On April 8, 2014 the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) confirmed Sport as the only Brazilian champion Flamengo in 1987 after contesting the decision in the lower court. Throughout his career at Flamengo, Zico scored 568 goals and was the top scorer in club history. In 1990, before a packed Maracana, Zico would make his farewell match with Flamengo. Even without your great crash, the early years of the post-Zico were glory for Flamengo. The first national victory was the second edition of the Brazil Cup in 1990 against. Between the end of 1990 and throughout 1991 the Flemish, now led by Junior, returned the "edge" over the rival, winning five win streak, and winning the 1991 State. The year 1992 was marked by winning another national title, beating Botafogo in the final of the Championship that year, which was the first game won by the Rossoneri a 3–0 and the second tied at 2 this year the highlight was again Junior. After the Brazilian title in 1992, the club entered a major financial crisis and the national and international achievements have become less frequent, although in general the team continued to win some championships on a regular basis, one of the few Brazilian clubs who have never suffered a considerable title drought. In 1995, the year of its centenary, the broadcaster Kléber Leite became chairman of the club and hired striker Romario, then the world's best player, who was on Barcelona. Even with Romário (who fought against Túlio this year and Renato Gaúcho the "title" King of the River) and other superstars who were hired as Edmundo and the year of the red-black centenary was not victorious. Flamengo won the Guanabara Cup just three goals from Romario against. In 1996, Flamengo won the unbeaten state championship and the Guanabara Cup, winning the last game of the Rio Cup and winning the title in advance. Romario was the top scorer of the state Savio and the highlight of the Flemish campaign in Copa Sudamericana Gold, where the club sagraria a champion. This was the third official international title of Flamengo. In 1999, he assumed Edmundo dos Santos Silva, and with it came a millionaire contract with sports marketing company ISL. Despite bad campaigns in the Brazilian Championship, Flamengo excelled in other competitions, so that won the triple champion state (1999-2000-2001) on top of them all. Won the Copa Mercosur in 1999 and the Champions League in 2001 Also in 2001, the Flemish escaped relegation to Serie B in the final round of the tournament and began a series of bad campaigns in the Brazilian Championship in four them fighting against relegation. The field of Flamengo.  ISL went bankrupt in 2002, for reasons unrelated to the contract with Flamengo, and the club was left without her millionaire partner. No money to keep the great team assembled, has begun a bad phase in red and black football. In the same year, Edmundo Santos Silva was removed from the presidency accused, among other things, administrative impropriety, in a very troubled and controversial vote (there are reports that there was no quorum in the Statute of the Club). Until today, it was proven the veracity of these allegations unless the evasion of taxes, which were assumed by the former president. No money for big signings, Flamengo failed to form competitive teams and narrowly missed demoted in Brazilian championship in 2002, 2004 and 2005. In 2003 and 2004, yet managed to reach the final of the Brazil Cup. In the first year, lost to. The second time, lost to. In 2004, Flamengo won their 28th state title, upon rival Vasco da Gama. In 2005 Flamengo played one of the worst years in its history. Earlier this year they did not win the Cup International Finta, and in the Brazilian Championship fought until the later rounds to get away from relegation, which was achieved only after the arrival of coach Joel Santana when in nine games played under his command, the team managed six wins and three draws, thus preventing the dispute from the Second Division in 2006. On March 9, 2007, Flamengo earned a commemorative date in Rio de Janeiro state's official calendar. On that day, State Governor Sérgio Cabral Filho signed Law 4998, declaring November 17 (the day the club was founded) "Flamengo Day". In the 2007 Brazilian Football Championship, Flamengo won many games at home, leaving the relegation zone and reaching the second place and then being defeated the last match in Recife, Pernambuco by Náutico 1–0. After this match, Flamengo finished the League in third place, climbing from second worst to third best. Flamengo started 2008 by winning the Rio de Janeiro State Championship over arch rival Botafogo. However a couple of days later, in the late rounds of Libertadores Cup, the team was humiliated at home by Club América from Mexico. Experts say that the team was eliminated because the finals against Botafogo took a heavy toll on the players stamina and endurance for the matchup against América. The 0–3 score was a big headline in the soccer world in the following day as Flamengo had won easily 4–2 in Azteca Stadium. In 2009 season after finishing the 1st phase of the Brazilian League in 10th place, Flamengo won the Brazilian Série A with this victory the Flamengo became six-time Brazilian League Champion. That team had Dejan Petković and Adriano, The Emperor (Adriano Leite Ribeiro).  Flamengo's home stadium is nominally the Estádio José Bastos Padilha (commonly known as Estádio da Gávea), which was inaugurated on September 4, 1938 and has a capacity of 8,000 fans. Flamengo rarely plays at Estádio da Gávea which is now used almost exclusively as the first team's training ground.

Maracanã was vital in the incredible 2007 Brazilian Série A Flamengo comeback, winning almost all the matches played in the Stadium, helping the club rise from the relegation zone to finish in third place securing a place in the Copa Libertadores 2008.
