   Andrew Geoffrey "Andy" Kaufman (January 17, 1949 – May 16, 1984) was an American entertainer, actor, and performance artist. While often referred to as a comedian, Kaufman did not consider himself to be one. He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, referring to himself instead as a "song-and-dance man"."Andy Kaufman - the Song and Dance Man". BBC. June 29, 2003. Retrieved August 29, 2014. Pranks and elaborate ruses were major elements of his career. His body of work maintains a cult following and he continues to be respected for his original material, performance style, and unflinching commitment to character. Kaufman was born on January 17, 1949 in New York City, the first son of Janice (née Bernstein) and Stanley Kaufman. He grew up in a middle-class Jewish familyBill Zehme, Lost in the Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman (New York 2001) in Great Neck, Long Island, New York, and began performing at age 9. He attended the now defunct two-year Grahm Junior CollegeList of Alumni at college website in Boston; after graduating in 1971, he began performing stand-up comedy at various small clubs along the East Coast. Kaufman first caught major attention with a character known as Foreign Man, who claimed to be from Caspiar (a fictional island in the Caspian Sea). As this character, Kaufman would appear on the stage of comedy clubs, play a recording of the theme from the Mighty Mouse cartoon show while standing perfectly still, and lip-sync only the line "Here I come to save the day" with great enthusiasm. He would proceed to tell a few jokes and perform a number of impersonations such as television character Archie Bunker or President Richard Nixon. Some variations of this performance were broadcast in the first season of Saturday Night Live; the Mighty Mouse number was featured in the October 11, 1975, premiere, while the joke-telling and Bunker impression were included in the November 8 broadcast that same year.SNL: The Complete First Season, 1975–1976. DVD recording. Foreign Man would often try to impersonate a whole series of different celebrities, with the comedy arising from the character's obvious ineptitude at impersonation. For example, in his fake accent Kaufman would say to the audience, "I would like to imitate Meester Carter, de president of de United States" and then, in the same voice, "Hello, I am Meester Carter, de president of de United States. T'ank you veddy much." At some point in the performance, usually when the audience was entirely used to Foreign Man's inability to perform a single convincing impression, Foreign Man would announce, "And now I would like to imitate the Elvis Presley", turn around, take off his jacket, slick his hair back, and launch into an unexpectedly credible Elvis Presley impersonation, one that Presley himself described as his favorite.Andy Kaufman at Yahoo! Movies Like Presley, he would take off his leather jacket and throw it into the audience, but Kaufman would then immediately ask for it back again. After, he would take a simple bow and say in his Foreign Man voice, "T'ank you veddy much."  Kaufman first used his Foreign Man character in nightclubs in the early 1970s, often to tell jokes incorrectly and do weak imitations of famous people before bursting into his Elvis Presley imitation. The character was then changed into Latka Gravas for the ABC's Taxi sitcom, appearing in 79 of 114 episodes from 1978 to 1983. Bob Zmuda confirms this: "They basically were buying Andy's Foreign Man character for the Taxi character Latka.""Andy Kaufman Oral History", interviews with Don Steinberg, originally published in short form in GQ Magazine, December 1999. Kaufman's long-time manager, George Shapiro, encouraged him to take the gig. "My feeling was that it would be a nice boost for his career ... and he would be playing a character that he knew very well, the Foreign Man—this particular character speaks poor English in Taxi and his name is Latka Gravas."Quoted in Lost in the Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman by Bill Zehme (2001), p. 6. Kaufman disliked sitcoms and was not happy with the idea of being in one, but Shapiro convinced him that it would quickly lead to stardom, which would earn him money he could then put into his own act.Lost in the Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman, Bill Zehme (ISBN 0385333722) Kaufman agreed to appear in 14 episodes per season, and initially wanted four for Tony Clifton. After Kaufman deliberately sabotaged Clifton's appearance on the show, however, this part of his contract was dropped. His character was given multiple personality disorder, which allowed Kaufman to randomly portray other characters. In one episode of Taxi, Kaufman's character came down with a condition that made him act like Alex Reiger, the main character played by Judd Hirsch. Another such recurring character played by Kaufman was the womanizing Vic Ferrari.Taxi, Season 3, Episode 20, ' 'Latka the Playboy' ', IMDB Taxi was a show with a large audience, and Kaufman was widely recognized as Latka. In the fictionalized version of Kaufman's life, Man on the Moon, Kaufman would punish such audiences by reading the novel The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald to them. The film depicted audiences laughing at this, not realizing that he was serious, with Kaufman proceeding to read the entire book to them in passive-aggressive frustration, despite most of the audience members' departure. In reality, Kaufman's act was lighthearted and funny: he would read a few pages, after which he would ask the audience if they wanted him to keep reading, or play a record. When the audience chose to hear the record, the record he cued up was a recording of him continuing to read The Great Gatsby from where he had left off. He never actually read (or played) the entirety of The Great Gatsby to an audience, but he sometimes liked to claim that he had. Sam Simon, who early in his career was a writer and later showrunner for Taxi, stated in a 2013 interview with Marc Maron for the WTF podcast that the story of Kaufman having been generally disruptive on the show was "a complete fiction" largely created by Bob Zmuda. Simon maintained that Zmuda has a vested interest in promoting an out-of-control image of Kaufman. In the interview Simon stated that Kaufman was "completely professional" and that he "told you Tony Clifton was him", but he also conceded that Kaufman would have "loved" Zmuda's version of events.Maron, Marc (May 16, 2013). "Episode 389 - Sam Simon". WTF Podcast with Marc Maron.  Another well-known Kaufman character is Tony Clifton, an absurd, audience-abusing lounge singer who began opening for Kaufman at comedy clubs and eventually even performed concerts on his own around the country. Sometimes it was Kaufman performing as Clifton, sometimes it was his brother Michael or Zmuda. For a brief time, it was unclear to some that Clifton was not a real person. News programs interviewed Clifton as Kaufman's opening act, with the mood turning ugly whenever Kaufman's name came up. Kaufman, Clifton insisted, was attempting to ruin Clifton's "good name" in order to make money and become famous. As a requirement for Kaufman's accepting the offer to star on Taxi, he insisted that Clifton be hired for a guest role on the show as if he were a real person, not a character. After throwing a tantrum on the set, Clifton was fired and escorted from the studio lot by security guards. Much to Kaufman's delight, this incident was reported in the local newspapers. At the beginning of an April 1979 performance at New York's Carnegie Hall, Kaufman invited his "grandmother" to watch the show from a chair he had placed at the side of the stage. At the end of the show, she stood up, took her mask off and revealed to the audience that she was actually comedian Robin Williams in disguise. Kaufman also had an elderly woman (named Eleanor Cody Gould) appear to have a heart attack and die on stage, at which point he reappeared on stage wearing a Native American headdress and performed a dance over her body, "reviving" her. The performance is most famous for Kaufman's ending the show by actually taking the entire audience, in 24 buses, out for milk and cookies. He invited anyone interested to meet him on the Staten Island Ferry the next morning, where the show continued. This kind of performance art was a hallmark of Kaufman's career. The Taxi deal with ABC included giving Kaufman a television special/pilot. He came up with Andy's Funhouse, based on an old routine he had developed while in junior college. The special was taped in 1977 but did not air until August 1979, on ABC. It featured most of Andy's famous gags, including Foreign Man/Latka and his Elvis Presley impersonation, as well as a host of unique segments (including a special appearance by children's television character Howdy Doody and the "Has-been Corner"). There was also a segment that included fake television screen static as part of the gag, which ABC executives were not comfortable with, fearing that viewers would mistake the static for broadcast problems and would change the channel—which was the comic element Kaufman wanted to present. Andy's Funhouse was written by Kaufman, Zmuda, and Mel Sherer, with music by Kaufman. In 1983 a very similar-looking show to Funhouse was filmed for the PBS's SoundStage program, called the The Andy Kaufman Show. It featured a peanut gallery like Funhouse, and opens in the middle of an interview Kaufman is doing in which he is laughing hysterically. He then proceeds to thank the audience for watching and the credits roll. In 1981 Kaufman made three appearances on Fridays, a variety show on ABC that was similar to Saturday Night Live. In his first appearance, during a sketch about four people out on a dinner date who excuse themselves to the restroom to smoke marijuana, Kaufman broke character and refused to say his lines. In response, cast member Michael Richards walked off camera and returned with a set of cue cards and dumped them on the table in front of Kaufman who responded by splashing Richards with water. Co-producer Jack Burns stormed onto the stage, leading to a brawl on camera before the show abruptly cut away to a commercial."Fridays TV Show" (1981) &#91;Show L-08&#93; "Andy Kaufman, the Fight Incident" &#91;09 of 12&#93; at YouTube It was later revealed that this incident was a staged practical joke that was known to Richards, associate producer Burns, and Kaufman but no one else on the cast or crew."Michael Richards 'Speaking Freely' transcript", Recorded Feb. 28, 2002, in Aspen, Colorado In continuation of the joke, Kaufman appeared the following week in a videotaped apology to the home viewers.Fridays TV Show (02.27.81) &#91;09 of 11&#93; "The Andy Kaufman Apology" at Youtube Later that year, Kaufman returned to host Fridays. At one point in the show, he invited a Lawrence Welk Show gospel and standards singer, Kathie Sullivan, on stage to sing a few gospel songs with him and announced that the two were engaged to be married, then talked to the audience about his newfound faith in Jesus (Kaufman was Jewish). That was also a hoax. Later, following a sketch about a drug-abusing pharmacist, Kaufman was supposed to introduce the band the Pretenders. Instead of introducing the band, he delivered a nervous speech about the harmfulness of drugs while the band stood behind him ready to play. After his speech, he informed the audience that he had talked for too long and had to go to a commercial.5MTL.COM PRESENTS Andy Kaufman introducing The Pretenders at YouTube Inspired by the theatricality of kayfabe, the staged nature of the sport, and his own tendency to form elaborate hoaxes, Kaufman began wrestling women during his act and was the self-proclaimed "Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion of the World," taking on an aggressive and ridiculous personality based upon the characters invented by professional wrestlers. He offered a $1,000 prize to any woman who could pin him. He employed performance artist Laurie Anderson, a friend of his, as a stooge in this act for a while.Laurie Anderson, Stories from the Nerve Bible (Perennial 1993) Kaufman initially approached the head of the World Wrestling Federation, Vince McMahon Sr., about bringing his act to the New York wrestling territory. McMahon dismissed Kaufman's idea as the elder McMahon was not about to bring "show business" into his Pro Wrestling society. Kaufman had by then developed a friendship with Wrestling magazine reporter/photographer Bill Apter. After many discussions about Andy wanting to be in the Pro Wrestling business, Apter called Memphis wrestling icon Jerry "The King" Lawler and introduced him to Kaufman by telephone. Later, Kaufman would finally step into the ring (in the Memphis wrestling circuit) with a man—Lawler himself. Kaufman taunted the residents of Memphis by playing "videos showing residents how to use soap" and proclaiming the city to be "the nation's redneck capital." The ongoing Lawler-Kaufman feud, which often featured Jimmy Hart and other heels in Kaufman's corner, included a number of staged "works", such as a broken neck for Kaufman as a result of Lawler's piledriver and a famous on-air fight on a 1982 episode of Late Night with David Letterman.kaufman-lawler at YouTube For some time after that, Kaufman appeared wearing a neck brace, insisting that his injuries were much worse than they really were. Kaufman would continue to defend the Inter-Gender Championship in the Mid-South Coliseum and offered an extra prize, other than the $1,000: that if he were pinned, the woman who pinned him would get to marry him and that Kaufman would also shave his head. Eventually, the feud and wrestling matches were revealed to have been staged works,Collins, Scott (November 15, 2013). "Jerry Lawler: Why his Andy Kaufman wrestling match still resonates". Los Angeles Times. and the two to be friends. This was not disclosed until more than 10 years after Kaufman's death, when the Emmy-nominated documentary A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman, aired on NBC in 1995. Jim Carrey, the one who revealed the secret, later went on to play Kaufman in the 1999 film Man on the Moon. In a 1997 interview with the Memphis Flyer, Lawler said he had improvised during their first match and the Letterman incident. Although officials at St. Francis Hospital stated that Kaufman's neck injuries were real, in his 2002 biography It's Good to Be the King ... Sometimes, Lawler detailed how they came up with the angle and kept it quiet. Even though Kaufman's injury was legitimate, the pair pretended that the injury was far more severe than it was. He also said that Kaufman's furious tirade and performance on Letterman was Kaufman's own idea, including when Lawler slapped Kaufman out of his chair. Promoter Jerry Jarrett would later recall that for two years, he would mail paychecks to Kaufman, with payments comparable to what other main-event wrestlers were getting at the time, but Kaufman never cashed any of them."(Title unknown)". Wrestling Observer Figure Four Online. Kaufman also appeared in the 1983 film My Breakfast with Blassie with professional wrestling personality "Classy" Freddie Blassie, a parody of the art film My Dinner With Andre. The film was directed by Johnny Legend, who employed his sister Lynne Margulies as one of the women who appears in the film. Margulies met Kaufman for the first time on camera, and they later became a couple, living together until Kaufman's death. In 2002 Kaufman became an unlockable character in the video game Legends of Wrestling II and a standard character in 2004's Showdown: Legends of Wrestling.David, Collin.

Although Kaufman made a name for himself as a guest on NBC's ''Saturday Night Live'', his first prime time appearances were several guest spots as the "Foreign Man" on the [[Dick Van Dyke]] variety slot in 1976. He also appeared four times on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' from 1976 to 1978, and three times on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' in 1972, 1977, and 1981. In the 1977 edition, Kaufman performed a song titled "I Trusted You" (which features only those three words, repeated over and over, as lyrics), while in 1981 he is shown sitting in the audience during a performance by Tony Clifton (although it was obvious Kaufman was not in the audience during the sketch).  His ''SNL ''appearances started with the [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|inaugural opening edition on 11 October 1975]]; he made 16 ''SNL'' appearances in all. He would do routines from his comedy act, such as the ''Mighty Mouse'' sing-along, Foreign Man character, the Elvis impersonation, etc. After he angered the audience with his female wrestling routine, in January 1983 Kaufman made a pre-taped appearance (his 16th) on the show, where he asked the audience if he should ever appear on the show again, saying that he would honor the audience's decision and stay off the show if the vote was negative.

[[Laurie Anderson]] worked alongside Kaufman for a time in the 1970s, acting as a sort of straight man in a number of his [[Manhattan]] and [[Coney Island]] performances. One of these performances included getting on a ride that people stand in and get spun around. After everyone was strapped in, Kaufman would start saying how he did not want to be on the ride in a panicked tone and eventually cry.

He claimed that he had been coughing for nearly a month, visited his doctor, and been told that nothing was wrong. When he returned to Los Angeles, he consulted a physician, then checked himself into [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] for a series of medical tests. A few days later, he was diagnosed with an extremely rare type of lung cancer.  After audiences were shocked by his gaunt appearance during January 1984 performances, Kaufman acknowledged that he had an unspecified illness which he hoped to cure with "[[natural medicine]]" including a diet of all fruits and vegetables, among other measures. Kaufman received palliative [[radiotherapy]], but by then the cancer had spread from his lungs to his brain. His last resort was "[[psychic surgery]]", a New Age "procedure" bearing no scientific merit, in [[Baguio]], Philippines, within March 1984. Kaufman died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 16, 1984 of [[renal failure|kidney failure]] caused by [[metastasis|metastasized]] [[large-cell lung carcinoma]], and his body was interred in the Beth David Cemetery in [[Elmont, New York]], ([[Long Island]]).

Because he did it first. So did [[Buster Keaton]], so did Andy."<ref>{{cite AV media|type=TV production|title=A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman|airdate=29 March 1995|publisher=NBC}}</ref> [[Carl Reiner]] recalled his distinction in the comedy world: <blockquote>Did Andy influence comedy? No. Because nobody's doing what he did. Jim Carrey was influenced—not to do what Andy did, but to follow his own drummer. I think Andy did that for a lot of people. Follow your own drumbeat. You didn't have to go up there and say 'take my wife, please.' You could do anything that struck you as entertaining. It gave people freedom to be themselves." Reiner also said of Kaufman: "Nobody can see past the edges, where the character begins and he ends.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19821128&id=1QMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZnUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3817,5349494 Andy Kaufman: 'Nobody can see past the edges', Kay Gardella, New York Daily News, Nov 28, 1982]</ref></blockquote>  [[Jim Carrey]] portrayed Kaufman in the 1999 biopic film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'', directed by [[Miloš Forman]]. The film took its title from the band [[R.E.M.]]'s [[Man on the Moon (song)|song of the same name]], which also mentions Kaufman's name. Carrey's portrayal was met with critical acclaim, earning him a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his performance.  Comedian [[Vernon Chatman]] compiled and produced Kaufman's first album, ''[[Andy and His Grandmother]]''—via [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]] in 2013.  Many wrestling fans have started a grass roots movement through social media to persuade the [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] to induct Kaufman into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]]. These fans of Kaufman are called "Andy's Army."  Russian Horror-Punk band "[[Korol i Shut|Король и шут]]" ("King and Jester") has a song called "Энди Кауфман" ("Andy Kaufman") about him.  ''[[The Chris Gethard Show]]'' paid homage to the Kaufman's ''Friday'''s incident in a goof on an episode with comedian Brett Davis throwing water on someone's face.<ref>http://splitsider.com/2014/10/a-rival-public-access-producer-almost-started-a-brawl-on-the-chris-gethard-show/</ref>  ==References== {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}  ==Further reading== * Zehme, Bill (1999), ''Lost in the Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman'', Delta Books.
