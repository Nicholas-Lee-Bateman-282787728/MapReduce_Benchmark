Throughout their meetings, Radwańska has matched Zvonareva's pace and movements around the court. Zvonareva is considered the more powerful of the two, with Radwańska noted as more focused at times, utilizing what Sports Illustrated's Courtney Nguyen dubbed "selective aggression" during the pair's 2011 matches. At the 2007 Kremlin Cup, Zvonareva won their first meeting in straight sets. The two did not play again until the 2011 season, when Radwańska won four of their five matches, including the finals of the Mercury Insurance Open and the Pan Pacific Open.

Stosur puts heavy topspin onto the ball, which has proven detrimental to Zvonareva's ball-striking ability. Stosur's style has also affected Zvonareva's ability to predict where Stosur is going to place the ball when she runs around her backhand to hit her forehand inside out.
