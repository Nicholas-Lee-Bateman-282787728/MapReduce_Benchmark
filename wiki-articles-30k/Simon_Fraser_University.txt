    Simon Fraser University, commonly referred to as SFU, is a public research university in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, with its main campus on Burnaby Mountain and satellite campuses in Downtown Vancouver and Surrey. The  main campus on Burnaby Mountain, located  from downtown Vancouver, was established in 1965 and comprises more than 30,000 students and approximately 950 faculty members. The university is adjacent to an urban village, UniverCity. The university was named after Simon Fraser, a North West Company fur trader and explorer. Undergraduate and graduate programs operate on a year-round tri-semester schedule. It is the only Canadian university competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In 2014, SFU placed 24th in Times Higher Education's 100 Under 50 category, a ranking of the top 100 universities in the world under 50 years old. SFU was ranked first among Canada's comprehensive universities in 1993, 1996-1998, 2000, 2008-2013, 2015 and 2016 by Maclean's.name="macleans_rank_2010">http://www.macleans.ca/education/best-of-the-best-introducing-the-2016-macleans-university-rankings/ Based on solely Canadian Universities for 2014, SFU is ranked 17th in CWUR, 8th in ARWU, 11th in Times, and 2nd in Maclean's Comprehensive.  To date, SFU faculty and alumni have won 43 fellowships to the Royal Society of Canada, three Rhodes Scholarships and one Pulitzer Prize.Ernest Becker   Simon Fraser University was founded upon the recommendation of a 1962 report entitled Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future, by Dr. John B. Macdonald who recommended the creation of a new university in the Lower Mainland. The British Columbia Legislature gave formal assent on March 1, 1963 for the establishment of the university in Burnaby. The original name of the school was Fraser University but was changed because of the initials "FU", which evoked the profane phrase "fuck you".http://blogs.theprovince.com/2016/01/30/50-little-known-facts-about-50-year-old-simon-fraser-university/http://www.the-peak.ca/2015/01/simon-fraser-vs-louis-riel/ In May of the same year, Dr. Gordon M. Shrum was appointed as the university's first Chancellor. From a variety of sites which were offered, Shrum recommended to the provincial government that the summit of Burnaby Mountain, 365 meters above sea level, be chosen for the new university. Architects Arthur Erickson and Geoffrey Massey won a competition to design the university, and construction began in the spring of 1964. The campus faces northwest over Burrard Inlet. Eighteen months later, on September 9, 1965, the university began its first semester with 2,500 students. The campus was noted in the 1960s and early 1970s as a hotbed of political activism, culminating in a crisis in the Department of Political Science, Sociology, and Anthropology in a dispute involving ideological differences among faculty. The resolution to the crisis included the dismantling of the department into today's separate departments. The school's original coat of arms was used from the university's inception until 2006, at which point the Board of Governors voted to adapt the old coat of arms and thereby register a second coat of arms. The adaptation replaced two crosslets with books after some in the university asserted the crosses had misled prospective foreign students into believing SFU was a private, religious institution rather than a public, secular one. In 2007, the university decided to register both the old coat of arms and the revised coat of arms featuring the books. In 2007, a new marketing logo was unveiled, consisting of white letters on block red.SFU News Online - SFU launches new brand - February 07, 2007  SFU's president is Andrew Petter, whose term began on September 1, 2010. Petter succeeded Dr. Michael Stevenson, who held a decade-long post as President from 2000 to 2010. In 2009, SFU became the first Canadian university to be accepted into the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Starting in the 2011-2012 season, SFU competed in the NCAA's Division II Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) and has now transitioned all 19 Simon Fraser Clan teams into the NCAA. SFU has the highest publication impact among Canadian comprehensive universities and the highest success rates per faculty member in competitions for federal research council funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). In 2007, the University began offering dual and double degree programs by partnering with international universities, such as a dual computing-science degree through partnership with Zhejiang University in China and a double Bachelor of Arts degree in conjunction with Australia's Monash University. On September 9, 2015, SFU celebrated its 50th anniversary. Over its 50 years, the university educated over 130,000 graduates. SFU has been rated as Canada's best comprehensive university (in 1993, 1996-1998, 2000, 2008-2013 and 2015) in the annual rankings of Canadian universities in Maclean's magazine since 1991. The Higher Education Strategy Associates ranked Simon Fraser University 6th nationally in Science and Engineering and 10th nationally in Social Sciences and Humanities.http://higheredstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rankings2012.pdf Research Infosource, Canada's leading provider of research intelligence evaluation, named SFU the top comprehensive university in Canada for "publication effectiveness" in 2006. Similar to most Canadian universities, SFU is a public university, with more than half of funding coming from taxpayers and the remaining from tuition fees. SFU was ranked 8th among all Canadian universities by Academic Ranking of World Universities - 2012, and Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, which ranks universities on their presence on the Internet, ranks Simon Fraser University 5th in Canada, 67th in North America and 83rd in the world. In academic year 2010-11, SFU is home to 29,697 undergraduates, with 14,911 of them being full-time and 14,786 part-time. The university has grown in recent years recently achieving an alumni population of over 100,000. It has 946 faculty members and 3,403 staff. In fall semester 2012, 4,269 International students enrolled, making up 17% of the undergraduate student body, one of the highest among Canadian universities. The majority of these international students (60%) come from Mainland China[and Hong Kong (6%)] and South Korea (6%). SFU's undergraduate student union is known as the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS). The university enrolls over 5,000 graduate students in a wide range of full-time and part-time academic programs. International students comprise 20% of the graduate student population as a whole and 30–40% in science and technology areas. A Graduate Student Society supports and advocates for graduate students at the university.  Teaching Assistants, Tutor Markers, Sessional Instructors, and Language Instructors at SFU are unionized. The union, The Teaching Support Staff Union (TSSU), is independent. Faculty and lecturers are members of the Faculty Association. Staff are members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), the Administrative and Professional Staff Association (APSA), or Polyparty. A few positions at the university such as some in Human Resources and senior administrative positions fall outside of the five associations or unions above. Under the current President, Andrew Petter, SFU's administration has incurred a number of grievances and bad faith bargaining judgments. During their most recent rounds of bargaining, both the TSSU and CUPE local 3338 resorted to job action, and the BC Labour Relations Board found SFU's administration to be bargaining in bad faith with the CUPE local. Conflicts since then include unpaid wages (in Fall 2013, 18% of TSSU members reported that they were not paid on the first payday; by the term's third payday, some members still had not received their wages), and a health plan, redundant with the provincial health plan available to all international students after their first three months in-province and costing double a prior plan's cost, in which international students are automatically enrolled. SFU also works with other universities and agencies to operate joint research facilities. These include Bamfield Marine Station, a major centre for teaching and research in marine biology; TRIUMF, a powerful cyclotron used in subatomic physics and chemistry research. SFU is also a partner institution in Great Northern Way Campus Ltd in Vancouver. In March 2006, SFU approved an affiliation agreement with a private college for international students to be housed adjacent to its Burnaby campus. This new college named Fraser International College, which was in the Multi Tenant Facility (now renamed as "Discovery 2 Building") located in Discovery Parks Trust SFU site,CKNW.com  is now moved into "Discovery 1 Building" after Discovery Parks Trust returned the building to Simon Fraser University. The MODAL Research Group, based at Simon Fraser, partners with multiple Canadian universities and arts organizations to carry out multi-disciplinary research in the arts with an emphasis on the study of artistic learning and engagement.MODAL Research Group. "About us". Retrieved 15 September 2015. There are eight faculties at Simon Fraser University:    Simon Fraser University has three campuses, each located in different parts of Greater Vancouver. SFU's main campus is located in Burnaby, atop Burnaby Mountain. Two satellite campuses are located in Vancouver's Downtown at Harbour Centre, and in Surrey. The downtown campus has expanded to include several other buildings in recent years, including the Segal Graduate School of Business, now known officially as SFU Vancouver. In September 2010, SFU Contemporary Arts moved into the Woodward's redevelopment, known as the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts. SFU's three campuses are all accessible by public transit. The Vancouver campus is a block away from the Waterfront SkyTrain station while the Surrey campus is adjacent to the Surrey Central SkyTrain station. The Burnaby campus is linked to the Production Way-University and Sperling-Burnaby Lake SkyTrain stations by frequent shuttle bus service.      The main campus is located atop Burnaby Mountain, at an elevation of 365 metres, overlooking the Burrard inlet to the north. All major departments in the university are housed at the Burnaby campus. The library on the main campus is called the W. A. C. Bennett Library, named after the Social Credit Premier of B.C. who established it. The campus also has two gym-complexes, named the Lorne-Davies Complex and Chancellor's Gym. An international-sized swimming pool is located within the Lorne-Davies Complex. Since the relocation of the School of Contemporary Arts to the Woodward's location, the Burnaby campus production theatre has been vacant. Located within the heart of the campus is the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and three art galleries. The campus has been awarded numerous architectural awards over the years, including the Gold Medal for Lieutenant-Governor 2009 Awards in Architecture and the 2007 Royal Architectural Institute of Canada's Prix du XXe siècle.http://www.sfu.ca/fs/Campus-Planning/AAA.htmlhttp://www.raic.org/honours_and_awards/awards_xxe/xxe-2007recipients/simonfraser_e.htm The Burnaby campus is composed of a vast complex of interconnected buildings spanning across 1.7&nbsp;km2 of land across Burnaby Mountain, from the eastern end of the campus to the western side, where the UniverCity urban village is located. The campus consists of the following buildings:  The largest of the three SFU Libraries, the W.A.C. Bennett Library, is based on the SFU Burnaby Campus, and holds over 2 million published books, 63,000 e-journal subscriptions, and 6,000 print subscriptions. Along with the UniverCity development agreement, residents of UniverCity are also allowed to borrow books from the library. SFU also has a Museum of Archeology and Ethnology, which holds many exhibits on lease from the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria. The exhibits are created by students as part of the museum studies courses offered in the Department of Archaeology. Archaeological collections arising from excavations and other research by faculty, staff and students are also housed in the museum. The SFU Library's Digital Collections provide internet access to digitized documents from a number of archival collections, such as Harrison Brown's Xi'an Incident collection, and the history of British Columbia and Western Canada in general, including documents from the Doukhobor migration from the Russian Empire to Saskatchewan and then to British Columbia assembled for donation to the university by John KeenlysideThe Doukhobor Collection "AQ Magazine", June 2001 Other highlights of the collection include The Vancouver Punk Collection, which includes more than 1200 posters as well as photographs, zines, and ephemera, the British Columbia Postcards Collection, and more than 9800 editorial cartoons from Canadian newspapers. Simon Fraser University's art galleries include: SFU Gallery on the Burnaby campus (established 1970), Audain Gallery at the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts in Vancouver (established 2010), and Teck Gallery at Harbour Centre in Vancouver (established 1989). SFU Galleries stewards the Simon Fraser University Art Collection, that includes, in its holdings of over 5,500 works, significant regional and national art works spanning the last century. The Bill Reid Centre for Northwest Coast Art Studies at SFU houses a collection of 50,000 objects, primarily digital images and digitized textual documents, which document the art, culture and history of different First Nations cultures of the Northwest Coast. The collection includes explorers’ drawings, sketches, paintings and original photography.Bill Reid Centre for Northwest Coast Art Studies The SFU Burnaby Campus provides residence to 1766 SFU and FIC students in 6 different areas, all located on the western-side of the campus.   UniverCity is an urban community located on top of Burnaby Mountain, adjacent to Simon Fraser University. It has won several awards for sustainable planning and development. Envisioned in 1963 by Arthur Erickson and Geoffrey Massey, the area adjacent to the University was not officially rezoned for development until 30 years later. Development of the community began in early 2000, when Simon Fraser University commenced construction on a new residential and commercial area occupying approximately  adjacent to the campus. As of September 2011, approximately 3000 people live in UniverCity. The main commercial district on University High Street now houses restaurants, stores, and a 20,000 square foot Nester's Market. A new elementary school, University Highlands Elementary, opened on September 1, 2010. Several new residential developments are currently in progress, including the construction of a 12-storey highrise in the heart of UniverCity.http://www.univercity.ca/code/navigate.php?Id=95    The SFU Surrey campus is the most recent satellite campus. It is located in downtown Surrey, B.C.. The campus is part of Central City, an architectural complex adjacent to the Surrey Central SkyTrain station. It was established in 2002 to absorb the students and programs of the former Technical University of British Columbia which was closed by the provincial government. It has since expanded to house the Surrey operations of other SFU programs. The Central City complex that houses the campus was designed by architect Bing Thom and opened in 2006. The Fraser Library is the branch of the SFU Library based on this campus, and is the only branch with a games room, as well as loaning out equipment to support students in the School of Arts and Interactive Technology. SFU Vancouver was launched in the 1980s with a store-front classroom. It was the first urban university classroom in British Columbia. A significant portion of funding for the building of the campus came from the private sector. The Vancouver campus has four buildings spread across the downtown core: SFU Harbour Centre, the Morris J Wosk Centre for Dialogue, the Segal Graduate School of Business and SFU Contemporary Arts at the restored Woodward's Building. The original campus building at Harbour Centre, a rebuilt heritage department store, officially opened on May 5, 1989. Today, the entire campus serves more than 70,000 people annually. Approximately 10,000 are graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in courses and degree programs based downtown.  The Belzberg Library is based at the Vancouver campus. In September 2010, SFU Contemporary Arts relocated to the historic Woodward's district in downtown Vancouver known as the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts. The  SFU facility is part of the Woodward's revitalization project. The new facility accommodates the increasing enrollment of students in the programme and new cultural facilities, including the Fei and Milton Wong Experimental theatre, screening rooms, sound studios, and art galleries. The student newspaper The Peak was established shortly after the university opened and is circulated throughout the University. CJSF-FM radio is the school's radio station, broadcasting from 90.1 FM to Burnaby and surrounding communities, online at www.cjsf.ca or on cable at 93.9 FM. The Simon Fraser Student Society provides funding for over 100 campus clubs. Various campus events include the annual Terry Fox Run, Gung Haggis Fat Choy, Clubs Week, and other multi-cultural events. The Tau chapter of Phrateres, a non-exclusive, non-profit social-service club, was installed here in 1966. Between 1924 and 1967, 23 chapters of Phrateres were installed in universities across North America, including the Theta chapter nearby at the University of British Columbia. Seven Greek organizations have formed SFU arms, although none are recognized by the University pursuant to a policy enacted in 1966:https://docushare.sfu.ca/dsweb/Get/Document-395662/Item-3A-19660404.pdf (Corrected based on attached reference - should be 1966, not 1996) Three Fraternities Three Sororities Two Co-Ed Professional Fraternities   The university's varsity sports teams are called the Simon Fraser Clan, and the mascot is a Scottish Terrier named McFogg the Dog. In sports and other competitions, there tends to be a strong rivalry between SFU and The University of British Columbia. The Clan is the first and currently the only athletic programme from outside of the United States that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Before joining the NCAA, the Clan used to compete in both the Canadian Interuniversity Sports (CIS) and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). In total, SFU has 15 varsity sport teams and 300 athletes. All varsity teams compete for their respective NCAA national championships, except for the Women's Wrestling team who competes for the Women's College Wrestling Association's national championship. Beside the varsity teams, SFU also houses various competitive club teams, including Men's Lacrosse, who currently competes in the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association, and Men's Hockey, who currently competes in the British Columbia Intercollegiate Hockey League. Other club teams include rugby, cheerleading, rowing, quidditch, and field hockey. SFU has won the NAIA NACDA Director's Cup five times, among others. On Friday, July 10, 2009, the NCAA announced that it has accepted SFU as a Division II member that will begin after a two-year transition period. SFU will compete in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference. It is the first Canadian university to be accepted as a member of the NCAA at any level.NCAA.org  In 2012, the Clan is finally accepted as the first international full member of the NCAA. Many former Clan athletes later represented Canada during the Olympic Games, including gold medalists Carol Huynh and Daniel Igali, and Olympic medalists Sue Holloway and Hugh Fisher. Other Clan alumni include: Jay Triano, Jeff Thue, Bob Molle, Chris Rinke, Carolyn Murray, Garry MacDonald, and Bruce Robertson. The Convocation is composed of all faculty members, senators, and graduates (degree holders, including honorary alumni) of the university. Its main function is to elect the Chancellor (who acts as Chair of Convocation) and four Convocation Senators. Convocation ceremonies are held twice annually to confer degrees (including honorary degrees) as well as award diplomas and certificates.  Board of Governors The Board is composed of the Chancellor, the President, two student members, two faculty members, one staff member, and eight individuals appointed by the British Columbia government. Traditionally, the Board is chaired by one of the government appointees. The Board is responsible for the general management and governance of the university. The Senate is composed of the Chancellor, the President, Vice-President, Academic, Vice-President, Research, Deans of Faculties, Dean of Graduate Studies, Dean of Continuing Studies, Associate Vice-President, Academic, University Librarian, Registrar (as Senate secretary), 14 student members, 28 faculty members, and 4 convocation members (who are not faculty members). The Senate is chaired by the President. The academic governance of the university is vested in the Senate. The Chancellor is elected by and from Convocation for a three-year term, which can be renewed once. The main responsibilities of the Chancellor are to confer degrees and represent the university in formal functions.  The President and Vice-Chancellor is appointed by the Board of Governors based on a selection process jointly established by the Board of Governors and the Senate of the university. As Chief Executive Officer and Chair of Senate, the President is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the university.    Terry Fox was a notable alumnus of SFU. Diagnosed with bone cancer which resulted in the amputation of his leg, the 18-year-old kinesiology major set out to run across Canada in the Marathon of Hope to raise funding and awareness about cancer. As a result of Terry Fox's legacy, running for charitable causes is now integrated within communities worldwide. He also inspired friend Rick Hansen's Man in Motion world tour by wheelchair. In 2001, SFU conferred an honorary degree to Betty Fox, mother of Terry Fox and Honorary Chair of the Terry Fox Foundation. In 1967, SFU awarded an honorary LL.D. (doctor of laws) to Marshall McLuhan, the first honorary degree awarded by the university. On April 20, 2004, SFU conferred honorary degrees upon three Nobel Peace Prize recipients: the 14th Dalai Lama, Bishop Desmond Tutu, and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi. At each convocation, SFU awards honorary degrees to various people from around the world for their activities and pursuits. Other honorary alumni award-winning filmmaker include Costa-Gavras, skier Nancy Greene Raine, Milton Wong, Doris Shadbolt, dancer and choreographer Judith Marcuse, economist Jeffrey Sachs, Peter Gzowski, Douglas Coupland, Firoz Rasul, Mossadiq Umedaly, Lui Passaglia, Romeo Dallaire, Canadian businessman Stephen Jarislowsky, Iain Baxter&, American agriculturalist Cary Fowler, experimental psychologist Steven Pinker, Martha Piper, Sarah McLachlan, Rick Hansen and Kim Campbell. Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Oregon, magician and noted critic of parapsychology, Ray Hyman was awarded Doctor of Science in October 2007. On October 8, 2015, Bill Nye was awarded an honorary doctorate of science from SFU. Rhodes Scholars  Due to the contemporary Brutalist architecture of the Burnaby Mountain campus, many buildings, including the WAC Bennett Library and Academic Quadrangle have been used for location shots in a variety of films and television programmes over the years. Its first use as a film set was for the 1972 science fiction film The Groundstar Conspiracy, in which the entire campus complex was used. It was then followed by The Fly II, which has scenes shot inside and outside the Burnaby campus. The campus also appeared in the 1989 movie American Boyfriends, set in 1965, with the buildings dressed to look like they were still under construction. The campus served as a high-tech corporate setting in the film Antitrust. Recently, in addition to other Vancouver-area landmarks, many parts of the Burnaby campus were used for the filming of the movie The 6th Day as well as Agent Cody Banks. The 2007 film Personal Effects, was filmed in the newly constructed Blusson Hall at the Burnaby Campus. In early 2008, the Burnaby campus was again used for filming, this time for The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 Remake). Filming of the 2012 movie Underworld: Awakening starring Kate Beckinsale, began in early 2011 with parts of the AQ modified as part of the set. The SFU Surrey Campus has also been featured in blockbuster movies such as I, Robot, Fantastic Four, and Catwoman. SFU was also the film location for Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, representing the Corbulo Academy of Military Science.  The Burnaby campus has been prominently featured in science fiction television series such as Stargate SG-1, Battlestar Galactica, and Andromeda. The Academic Quadrangle has also served as a backdrop for shots of "FBI headquarters" in the television series The X-Files as well as Sliders. Exterior shots of the Academic Quadrangle have also been used in the Vancouver-based TV series JPod (based on the book). The SFU Surrey campus has been featured in several episodes of Smallville and Caprica, with the entire mezzanine and registration area being transformed into the Caprica Inter-colonial Space Port. It has also been featured in the Smallville TV series. Recently, filming of the TV show Hellcats commenced in the West Gym of the Chancellor's Gymnasium in November 2010. In Stargate SG-1, SFU was the homeworld for the technologically advanced Tollan, as seen in the Tollan-centric episodes "Pretense" (Season 3 Ep. 15) and "Between Two Fires" (Season 5 Ep. 9).
