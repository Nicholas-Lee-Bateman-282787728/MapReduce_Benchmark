 General Sir Horace Lockwood Smith-Dorrien,  (26 May 1858 – 12 August 1930) was a British soldier. One of the few British survivors of the Battle of Isandlwana as a young officer, he also distinguished himself in the Second Boer War. Smith-Dorrien held senior commands in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) during the First World War. He commanded II Corps at the Battle of Mons, the first major action fought by the BEF, and the Battle of Le Cateau, where he fought a vigorous and successful defensive action contrary to the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief Sir John French, with whom he had had a personality clash dating back some years. In the spring of 1915 he commanded the Second Army at the Second Battle of Ypres. He was relieved of command by French for requesting permission to retreat from the Ypres Salient to a more defensible position. Horace Smith-DorrienNote: The surname is properly hyphenated though the form "Smith Dorrien" is sometimes seen. The first syllable of Dorrien is pronounced like the word "door". was born at Haresfoot, a house near Berkhamsted, to Colonel Robert Algernon Smith-Dorrien and Mary Ann Drever. He was the twelfth child of sixteen; his eldest brother was Thomas Algernon Smith-Dorrien-Smith,  the Lord Proprietor of the Isles of Scilly from 1872 – 1918.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 18th edition, London 1965-1972, volume 1, page 87.Robert A Smith-Dorrien, Col. Herts Militia = Mary Ann, daughter of Dr Drever, by Mary A, daughter of Thos. Dorrien. By her he had (1) Thos.

The Smith family, being a popular account of most branches of the name – however spelt – from the fourteenth century downwards, with numerous pedigrees now published for the first time He was educated at Harrow, and on 26 February 1876 entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He had hoped to join the 95th Rifle Brigade of Peninsular War fame.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 183. After passing out he was commissioned in 1877 as a subaltern to the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot, later to become the Sherwood Foresters.Travers 1987, p. 291. On 1 November 1878, he was posted to South Africa where he worked as a transport officer. In this role he encountered, and fought against, corruption in the army. Smith-Dorrien was present at the Battle of Isandlwana during the Zulu Wars on 22 January 1879, serving with the British invasion force as a transport officer for the army's Royal Artillery detachment. As Zulu forces overran the British forces, Smith-Dorrien narrowly escaped on his transport pony over 20 miles of rough terrain with twenty Zulu warriors in hot pursuit, crossing the Buffalo River, 80 yards wide and with a strong current, by holding the tail of a loose horse. Smith-Dorrien was one of fewer than fifty British survivors of the battle (many more native African troops on the British side also survived), and one of only five Imperial officers to escape the Zulu bloodbath.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 185. Because of his conduct in trying to help other soldiers escape from the battlefield, including a colonial commisariat officer named Hamer whose life he saved, he was recommended for a Victoria Cross, but, as the recommendation did not go through the proper channels, he never received it. He took part in the rest of that war. His observations on the difficulty of opening ammunition boxes led to changes in British practice for the rest of the war, though modern commentators argue that this was not as important a factor in the defeat as was thought at the time. Smith-Dorrien served in Egypt under Evelyn Wood. He was promoted captain on 1 April 1882, appointed assistant chief of police in Alexandria on 22 August 1882, then given command of Mounted Infantry in Egypt on 3 September 1882, and was seconded to the Egyptian army (1 February 1884).Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 184, 185. During this time, he forged a lifelong friendship with the then Major Kitchener. He met Gordon more than once, but his bad knee kept him off the expedition to relieve Khartoum. He served on the Suakin Expedition. On 30 December 1885, he witnessed the Battle of Gennis, where the British Army fought in red coats for the last time. The next day (31 December 1885) he was given his first independent command, 150 men (a mixture of hussars, mounted infantry and Egyptians) with fifty infantry in reserve. His task was to capture nine Arab river supply boats (nuggars), in order to achieve which he had to exceed his orders by going beyond the village of Surda, making a 60-mile journey on horseback in 24 hours. For this, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1886. Smith-Dorrien then left active command to go to the Staff College, Camberley (1887–9). Staff College was not yet much respected, and he later recorded that he devoted much time to sport whilst there.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 186. He was posted to India, and promoted major on 1 May 1892. He became Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, Bengal, on 1 April 1893 and then Assistant Adjutant General, Bengal, on 27 October 1894.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 184.The biographical summary given by Tim Travers does not appear to reconcile exactly with that presented by Ian Beckett. Travers has him as DAAG Punjab 1894-6, then DAAG Chitral 1895 (Travers 1987, p. 291). He returned to his regiment where he commanded troops during the Tirah Campaign of 1897–98. In 1898, he transferred back to Egypt. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 20 May 1898 and appointed Commanding Officer of the 13th Sudanese Battalion (16 July 1898). He fought at the Battle of Omdurman (2 September 1898), where his infantry fired at Devishes from entrenched positions. He commanded the British troops during the Fashoda incident. He was promoted brevet colonel 16 November 1898 and Commanding Officer of the Sherwood Foresters and substantive lieutenant-colonel (1 January 1899). On 31 October 1899, he shipped to South Africa for the Second Boer War, arriving at Durban 13 December 1899, in the middle of “Black Week”.  On 2 February 1900, Lord Roberts put him in command of 19 Brigade and, on 11 February, he was promoted to Major-General, making him one of youngest generals in the British army at the time.Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 184, 187. He later commanded a division in South Africa. He provided covering fire for French's Cavalry Division at Klipsdrift, and played an important role at the Battle of Paardeberg (18 to 27 February 1900), where he was summoned by Lord Roberts and asked for his views in the presence of Lord Kitchener, French and Henry Colville. He argued for the use of sapping and fire support, rather than attacking the entrenched enemy over open ground. Kitchener followed him to his horse to remonstrate that he would be “a made man” if he attacked as Kitchener wished, to which he replied he had given his views and would only attack if ordered to do so. A week later he took the laager after careful assault.Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 187–188. At Sanna's Post (31 March 1900), Smith-Dorrien ignored inept orders from Colville to leave wounded largely unprotected and managed an orderly retreat without further casualties. He took part in the Battle of Leliefontein (7 November 1900). On 6 February 1901, Smith-Dorrien's troops were attacked in the Battle of Chrissiesmeer. Smith-Dorrien's qualities as a commander meant he was one of a very few British commanders to enhance his reputation during this war. Smith-Dorrien was mentioned three times in the “London Gazette”, and Ian Hamilton later wrote highly of his performance and his grasp of the men's morale, whilst Roberts also thought highly of his South Africa performance. He was at the top of a list (21 September 1901) of eighteen successful commanders of columns or groups of columns, including Haig and Allenby, whom French commended to Lord Roberts.Holmes 2004, p114-5  On 22 April 1901, he received orders to return to India where he was made Adjutant-General (6 November 1901) under Kitchener. He was placed in command of the 4th (Quetta) Division in Baluchistan, a post he held from 30 June 1903 until 1907. He was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1904 and promoted lieutenant-general on 9 April 1906. He introduced the Staff Ride, erroneously attributed by Terraine to Haig.Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 184, 188. He also helped found the Staff College at Quetta in 1907. In the dispute between Kitchener and Lord Curzon over the role of the Military Member, Smith-Dorrien stayed neutral, torn between his relations with Kitchener and with the Military Member himself, Sir Arthur Power Palmer. Smith-Dorrien returned to England and (1 December 1907) became GOC of the Aldershot Command. During this time, he instituted a number of reforms designed to improve the lot of the ordinary soldier. One was to abandon the practice of posting pickets to police the soldiers when they were outside the base. Another was to improve sports facilities. His reforms earned many plaudits (but were treated as an implied criticism by his predecessor, Sir John French).Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 189. Unlike many senior generals of the era, Smith-Dorrien could speak to troops with ease and was greatly admired by regimental officers.Robbins 2005, p. 17. In prewar training he wanted “individual initiative and intelligence” in British soldiers.Travers 1987, p. 47. He later wrote: “one could never become an up-to-date soldier in the prehistoric warfare to be met with against the Dervishes”.Robbins 2005, p. 13. He improved the frequency and methods of training in marksmanship of all soldiers (including cavalry, and including shooting at moving targets). During this period, the higher ranks of the army were divided on the best use of cavalry. Smith-Dorrien, along with Lord Roberts, Sir Ian Hamilton and others, doubted that cavalry could often be used as cavalry, i.e. that they should still be trained to charge with sword and lance, instead thinking they would be more often deployed as mounted infantry, i.e. using horses for mobility but dismounting to fight. To this end, he took steps to improve the marksmanship of the cavalry. This did not endear him to the arme blanche ('pro-cavalry') faction, which included French and Douglas Haig, and whose views prevailed after the retirement of Lord Roberts. Aylmer Haldane recorded that at the 1909 manoeuvres French was “unfair” in summing up for Paget against Smith-Dorrien.Travers 1987, pp. 15–16. Smith-Dorrien annoyed French – with whom he had still been on relatively cordial terms at the end of the South African War  – by abolishing the pickets which trawled the streets for drunk soldiers, by more than doubling the number of playing fields available to the men, by cutting down trees, and by building new and better barracks. On 21 August 1909 he lectured all his cavalry officers – in the 16th Lancers’ mess – about the importance of improving their men's musketry. By 1910 the feud between French and Smith-Dorrien was common knowledge throughout the Army. Smith-Dorrien, happily married to a young and pretty wife, objected to French’s womanising, and French’s nephew later claimed to have overheard “a ferocious exchange” between them, in which Smith-Dorrien declared “Too many whores around your headquarters, Field-Marshal”.Holmes 2004, p131-3 He also tried to get the army to replace the old Maxim gun with the new Vickers Maxim gun, which weighed less than half as much and had a better water-cooling system, but the War Office did not approve the expenditure.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 190. In 1911, he was made Aide-de-Camp to King George V. He was part of the King's hunt in the Chitwan area of Nepal; on 19 December 1911, Smith-Dorrien killed a rhino and on the following day shot a bear.Kees Rookmaaker, Barbara Nelson and Darrell Dorrington "The royal hunt of tiger and rhinoceros in the Nepalese terai in 1911" Pachyderm No. 38, January–June 2005 pp. 91–92. On 1 March 1912, he was appointed GOC Southern Command (Douglas Haig had succeeded him as GOC Aldershot). At Southern Command he had jurisdiction over twelve counties and many regimental depots. He had experience of dealing with Territorials (who would make up much of II Corps in 1914) for the first time and instigated training on fire-and-movement withdrawals which would also prove useful at Le Cateau. He was promoted to full General (10 August 1912) and raised to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1913. Although Smith-Dorrien was perfectly urbane and, by the standards of the day, kind-hearted towards his troops, he was notorious for furious outbursts of bad temper, which could last for hours before his equilibrium was restored. It has been suggested that the pain from a knee injury was one cause of his ill temper. It was rumoured that Smith-Dorrien’s temper was caused by some kind of serious illness. Esher (a royal courtier who exercised great influence over military appointments) had dined with Smith-Dorrien (28 January 1908) to see if he was indeed “changed and weakened”. Lord Crewe (letter to Seely 5 September 1913) turned him down for the post of Commander-in-Chief India because of his foul temper (A.J. Smithers, probably wrongly, blames French’s enmity for denying Smith-Dorrien the promotionHolmes 2004, p5).Although Holmes does not specifically say so, this presumably refers to the appointment of Beauchamp Duff in March 1914. Crewe had not yet been Secretary of State for India in 1909 when O’Moore Creagh had succeeded Kitchener. Unlike French, he was politically astute enough to avoid becoming entangled in the Curragh Incident of 1914. Unlike a number of British generals of the era, Smith-Dorrien was not a political intriguer. In 1914, the Public Schools Officers' Training Corps annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near Salisbury Plain. Lord Kitchener was to review the cadets, but the imminence of the war kept him elsewhere, and Smith-Dorrien was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a Bermudian cadet who was present) "that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust – probably not more than one-quarter of us – learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it."Donald Christopher Smith, ed. John William Cox, Jr. Merely For the Record: The Memoirs of Donald Christopher Smith 1894–1980 (Bermuda, privately printed c. 1982), p. 59. With the outbreak of the Great War, he was given command of the Home Defence Army, part of Ian Hamilton's Home Defence Central Force.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 191. However, following the sudden death of Sir James Grierson, he was placed in charge of the British Expeditionary Force II Corps, by Lord Kitchener, the new Secretary of State for War. Field Marshal Sir John French had wanted Sir Herbert Plumer but Kitchener chose Smith-Dorrien as he knew he could stand up to French, and in the full knowledge that French disliked him.Holmes 2004, pp. 208–209. Kitchener admitted to Smith-Dorrien that he had doubts about appointing him, but put them to one side.Terraine 1960, pp. 50–51. Smith-Dorrien arrived at GHQ (20 August) and formally asked French's permission to keep a special diary to report privately to the King as His Majesty had requested. French could hardly refuse, but this further worsened their relations.Holmes 2004, p. 212. Smith-Dorrien later claimed in his memoirs that French had received him “pleasantly”, but his diary at the time simply records matter-of-factly that he “motored into to Le Cateau and saw the Commander-in-Chief” which may be suspiciously brief in contrast to the diary's normally detailed description of other events. There was also personal friction between George Forestier-Walker and Johnny Gough VC, the chiefs of staff of II Corps and I Corps respectively.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 192. French still believed (22 August) that there were only light German forces facing the BEF, but after hearing intelligence that German forces were stronger than thought and that the BEF had moved far ahead of Lanrezac's Fifth French Army on its right, Sir John cancelled the planned further advance. He told Lanzerac that he would hold his current position for another 24 hours.Holmes 2004, pp. 213–215. French's and Smith-Dorrien's accounts differ about the conference at 5.30am on 23 August. French's account in his memoirs “1914” stated that he had become doubtful of the advance into Belgium and warned his officers to be ready to attack or retreat. This agrees largely with French's diary at the time, in which he wrote that he had warned Smith-Dorrien that the Mons position might not be tenable. When “1914” was published, Smith-Dorrien claimed that French had been “in excellent form” at the meeting and had still been planning to advance. However, in his own memoirs Smith-Dorrien admitted that French had talked of either attacking or retreating, although he claimed that it had been he who had warned that the Mons position was untenable. Edmonds in the “Official History” agreed that French had probably been prepared either to attack or to retreat.Holmes 2004, pp. 215–216. Edmonds – who was not an eyewitness – later claimed in his memoirs that French had instructed Smith-Dorrien to “give battle” on the line of the Conde Canal, and that when Smith-Dorrien queried whether he was to attack or defend he was simply told, after French had whispered with Murray, “Don’t ask questions, do as you are told”.Beckett & Corvi 2006, pp. 193–194. Smith-Dorrien's II Corps took the brunt of a heavy assault by the German forces at Mons, with the Germans under von Kluck attempting a flanking manoeuvre. Forestier-Walker, Chief of Staff II Corps, was driven by Smith-Dorrien's foul temper to attempt to resign his post during the Battle of Mons but was told by the BEF Chief of Staff Murray “not to be an ass”.Holmes 2004, p. 224. During the battle of Mons Smith-Dorrien's car was almost struck by a German shell. French ordered a general retreat, during which I Corps (under General Douglas Haig) and II Corps became separated.Holmes 2004, pp. 220–222. French agreed to Haig's retreat east of the Forest of Mormal (Haig Diary, 24 August) without, apparently, the knowledge of Smith-Dorrien. Murray noted in his diary (25 August) that GHQ had moved back from Le Cateau to St Quentin and that I Corps was being heavily engaged by night – making no mention of what II Corps were up to.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 195. Because the German plan was to envelop the BEF from the west, most of the pressure fell on II Corps, which suffered higher casualties (2,000) in its fighting withdrawal on 24 August than at Mons the previous day (1,600).Terraine 1960, p. 112. French had a long discussion with Murray and Wilson (25 August) as to whether the BEF should stand and fight at Le Cateau, a position which had been chosen for both I and II Corps to hold after they had retreated on either side of the Forest of Mormal. II Corps had been harried by German forces as it retreated west of the forest and Sir John wanted to fall back as agreed with Joffre, and hoped that the BEF could pull out of the fight altogether and refit behind the River Oise. Wilson issued orders to Smith-Dorrien to retreat from Le Cateau the next day. On the evening of 25 August Smith-Dorrien was unable to locate 4th Division and Cavalry Division. Allenby (GOC Cavalry Division) reached him at 2am on 26 August and reported that his horses and men were “pretty well played out” and unless they retreated under cover of darkness there would be no choice but to fight in the morning. Allenby agreed to act under Smith-Dorrien's orders. Hamilton (GOC 3rd Division) also reported that his men would be unable to get away before 9am, which also left little choice but to fight, lest isolated forces be overwhelmed in a piecemeal fashion.Terraine 1960, pp. 126–127. A French cavalry corps under Sordet also took part on the west flank.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 200. French was awakened at 2am on 26 August with news that Haig's I Corps was under attack at Landrecies, and ordered Smith-Dorrien (3:50 am) to assist him. Smith-Dorrien replied that he was “unable to move a man”. This irritated French, as Haig (who already had serious doubts of French's competence) was a protege of his.Holmes 2004, pp. 222–223. Smith-Dorrien finally managed to locate Snow (GOC of the newly arrived 4th Division), at 5am (his brigades were assembling in their positions between 3.30am and 5.30am) He was not under Smith-Dorrien's orders but agreed to assist. Smith-Dorrien cancelled his orders to retreat and decided to stand and fight at Le Cateau. Smith-Dorrien still hoped for assistance from I Corps, which did not reach its intended position to the immediate east of Le Cateau. This news reached French at 5am – woken from his sleep once again, and insisting that the exhausted Murray not be woken, he telegraphed back that he still wanted Smith-Dorrien to “make every endeavour” to fall back but that he had “a free hand as to the method”, which Smith-Dorrien took as permission to make a stand. On waking properly, French ordered Wilson to telephone Smith-Dorrien and order him to break off as soon as possible. Wilson ended the conversation – by his own account – by saying “Good luck to you. Yours is the first cheerful voice I've heard in three days.” Smith-Dorrien's slightly different recollection was that Wilson had warned him that he risked another Sedan.Hastings 2013, p222 Von Kluck believed that he was facing the entire BEF (numbering, he believed, six divisions) and hoped to envelop it on both flanks, but lack of coordination among the German attackers ruled this out.Terraine 1960, p. 132. Smith-Dorrien's decision to stand and fight enraged French, who accused him of jeopardising the whole BEF. French and his staff believed that II Corps had been destroyed at Le Cateau, although units reassembled after the retreat. Haig, despite believing French to be incompetent, wrote (4 Sep) of Smith-Dorrien's “ill-considered decision”. Murray later (in 1933) called Smith-Dorrien “a straight honourable gentleman, most lovable, kind and generous” but thought he “did wrong to fight other than a strong rearguard action”. However, Terraine praised the decision to stand and fight, arguing that despite heavy casualties, it halted the German advance.Holmes 2004, pp. 223–225. GHQ fell back to Noyon (26 August), and then and the next day Huguet and other French liaison officers gave Joffre a picture of shattered British forces falling back from Le Cateau. In fact Smith-Dorrien's staff were making intense efforts to hold II Corps together, although at a meeting (held at 2am on 27 August, as Smith-Dorrien had found GHQ's present location with great difficulty) French accused him of being overly optimistic.Holmes 2004, p. 226. Smith-Dorrien (2 September) recorded that his men were much fitter and had recovered their spirits.Terraine 1960, p. 178. Smith-Dorrien's II Corps had the honour of leading the advance at the Marne and the First Battle of the Aisne, Haig's I Corps to his right being delayed by forests.Terraine 1960, p. 197. The battle for Hill 60 was a notable struggle here. A defensive line at Neuve Chapelle became known as the Smith-Dorrien Trench (or, sometimes, the Smith-Dorrien Line). II Corps was effectively broken up in late October to reinforce I Corps, but Smith-Dorrien was given Second Army (26 December 1914). His writings from the time show that he was fully aware of the importance of artillery, machine guns and aircraft.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 201. Smith-Dorrien later recorded that French inflicted “pin-pricks” on him from February 1915 onwards, including the removal of Forestier-Walker as his Chief of Staff.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 204. This was supposedly on the grounds that Forestier-Walker was needed to command a division training in England, although two months later he was still waiting to receive the command. French told Haig that Smith-Dorrien was “a weak spot” (5 February 1915). During the Battle of Neuve Chapelle he was dissatisfied (13 March) at the “lack of determination” of Smith-Dorrien's diversionary attacks.Holmes 2004, pp. 272–274, 282–284. Smith-Dorrien was not always immune to the excessive optimism which British officers were expected to display throughout the war: Aylmer Haldane recorded in his diary (15 March 1915) that prior to the battle Smith-Dorrien had been claiming that the war would be won in March 1915.Robbins 2005, p. 70. However, French complained to Kitchener (Secretary of State for War) about him (28 March). At the Second Battle of Ypres, the British were defending a barely-tenable salient, held at great cost at the First Battle of Ypres five months earlier. On 22 April 1915, the Germans used poison gas on the Western Front for the first time and heavy casualties were sustained. On 27 April, with the French counterattack (north of the salient) coming later and smaller than promised, Smith-Dorrien recommended withdrawal to the more defensible “GHQ Line”. Sir John privately agreed, but was angered that the suggestion came from Smith-Dorrien. Sir John just wanted the situation kept quiet so as not to distract from the upcoming offensive at Aubers Ridge by Haig's First Army – one historian describes this attitude as “cretinous”.Neillands 2006, pp. 110–114. Smith-Dorrien wrote a long letter (27 April) explaining the situation to Robertson (then chief of staff BEF). He received a curt telephone message telling him that, in Sir John's opinion, he had adequate troops to defend the salient. A few hours later written orders arrived, directing Smith-Dorrien to turn command of the salient over to Herbert Plumer and to lend Plumer his chief of staff and such other staff officers as Plumer required. (In practice this meant that Plumer's V Corps, already holding the salient, became an autonomous force reporting directly to GHQ, with Smith-Dorrien left only with II Corps south of the salient). Plumer immediately asked permission for a withdrawal almost identical to that proposed by Smith-Dorrien. After a delay whilst Foch conducted another counterattack, French accepted. On 30 April, Haig wrote in his diary Sir John also told me Smith-Dorrien had caused him much trouble. 'He was quite unfit [(he said)] to hold the Command of an Army' so Sir J. had withdrawn all troops from him control except the II Corps. Yet Smith-D. stayed on! [He would not resign!] French is to ask Lord Kitchener to find something to do at home. … He also alluded to Smith-Dorrien's conduct on the retreat, and said he ought to have tried him by Court Martial, because (on the day of Le Cateau) he 'had ordered him to retire at 8 am and he did not attempt to do so [but insisted on fighting in spite of his orders to retire]'.Sheffield, Gary and Bourne, John (editors) Douglas Haig: War Diaries and Letters 1914–1918 Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2005 ISBN 0-297-84702-3 pp. 119–120. After French refused permission to retreat, Smith-Dorrien noted (6 May 1915) that the planned counterattack was a complete failure with casualties higher than predicted by GHQ.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 203. Smith-Dorrien's eventual offer to resign (6 May) was ignored, and on that same day French used the 'pessimism' of the withdrawal recommendation as an excuse to sack him from command of Second Army altogether. "Wully" Robertson is said to have broken the news to him with the words " 'Orace, yer for 'ome " (Robertson was a former enlisted man who dropped his aitches), although by another account he might have said " 'Orace, yer thrown " (a cavalry metaphor). The Official Historian Brigadier Edmonds later alleged that French had removed Smith-Dorrien as he was senior to Haig and stood in the way of Haig becoming Commander-in-Chief, and that Wilson had put the idea in French's mind, but this may be doubtful as their antipathy went back a long way and French was later (December 1915) replaced by Douglas Haig as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF against his will. Smith-Dorrien was raised to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (14 May 1915) and was briefly appointed GOC First Home Army (22 June 1915). After a period in Britain, Smith-Dorrien was appointed GOC East Africa (22 November 1915) to fight the Germans in German East Africa (present day Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi) but pneumonia contracted during the voyage to South Africa prevented him from taking command. His former adversary, Jan Smuts, took on this command. Smith-Dorrien took no significant military part in the rest of the war. He returned to England in January 1916 and on 29 January 1917 was appointed lieutenant of the Tower of London. He led a campaign in London for moral purity, calling for suppression of "suggestive or indecent" media.Jerry White, Zeppelin Nights: London in the First World War, cited  in review by Saul David in Evening Standard, 8 May 2014, page 41. French, partly in response to criticism inspired by Smith-Dorrien, later wrote a partial and inaccurate account of the opening of the war in his book 1914, which attacked Smith-Dorrien. Smith-Dorrien, as a serving officer, was denied permission to reply in public. French's official despatch after Le Cateau had praised Smith-Dorrien's “rare and unusual coolness, intrepididity and determination”. In 1914 French claimed that this had been written before he knew the full facts, and that Smith-Dorrien had risked destruction of his corps and lost 14,000 men and 80 guns (actual losses of each were around half of this number). Smith-Dorrien, in a private written Statement, called 1914 “mostly a work of fiction and a foolish one too”.Holmes 2004, p. 223.   Smith-Dorrien's last position was as Governor of Gibraltar from 9 July 1918 – 26 May 1923, where he introduced an element of democracy and closed some brothels. According to Wyndham Childs in the summer of 1918, Smith-Dorrien tried, and nearly succeeded, in uniting the Comrades of the Great War, the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers, and the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers into one body. The merger later took place in 1921 to form the British Legion. He retired in September 1923, living in Portugal and then England. He devoted much his time to the welfare and remembrance of Great War soldiers. He worked on his memoirs, which were published in 1925. As French was still alive at the time of writing, he still felt unable to rebut 1914. Despite his treatment by French, in 1925, he rushed across Europe to act as a pallbearer at French's funeral,Neillands 2006, p. 116. an act appreciated by French's son. He played himself in the film The Battle of Mons, released in 1926.The Battle of Mons (WMV format, 14 seconds, 377KB). In June 1925, he unveiled the war memorial in Memorial Avenue, Worksop. On 4 August 1930, he unveiled the Pozières Memorial. He died on 12 August 1930 following injuries sustained in a car accident in Chippenham, Wiltshire; he was 72 years old.

She was the eldest daughter of Colonel and Mrs Schneider, of Oak Lea, Furness Abbey. Olive's mother was stepsister to Gen. Sir Arthur Power Palmer GCB, GCIE, who died in 1904. They had three sons: Horace and Olive Smith-Dorrien informally adopted Power Palmer's two daughters (Gabrielle and unknown), who were left homeless after his second wife's death in 1912. During the Great War Lady Smith-Dorrien founded the Lady Smith-Dorrien's Hospital Bag Fund. A problem had been identified that wounded soldiers often became separated from their personal effects while in hospital. Volunteers for the fund sewed between 40,000 and 60,000 bags a month to hold soldiers' valuables, totalling around five million throughout the war. For this work, she was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). She also served as President of the animal welfare charity, The Blue Cross, alleviating the suffering of war horses.Olive Smith-Dorrien For Horses of the Allies.; Lady Smith-Dorrien Makes an Appeal for the Blue Cross The New York Times 15 December 1915, p. 14. For her services in that field, she received the gold medal of the Reconnaissance française. In 1932, Olive became Principal of the Royal School of Needlework (RSN). In 1937, the RSN worked on the Queen's Train (Coronation Robe), canopy and the two chairs to be used in Westminster Abbey during the Coronation. She was awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal for work done.
