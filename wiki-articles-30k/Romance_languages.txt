   The Romance languages, (sometimes called the Latin languages, and occasionally the Romanic or Neo-Latin languages) are the modern languages that evolved from spoken Latin between the sixth and ninth centuries A.D. and that thus form a branch of the Italic languages within the Indo-European language family. Today, around 800 million people are native speakers worldwide, mainly in Europe and the Americas, but also elsewhere. Additionally, the major Romance languages have many non-native speakers and enjoy widespread use as lingua francas.[M. Paul Lewis, Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth Edition http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size] This is especially the case for French, which is in widespread use throughout Central and West Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius and the Maghreb region. The five most widely spoken Romance languages by number of native speakers are Spanish (410 million), Portuguese (216 million), French (75 million), Italian (60 million), and Romanian (25 million).Nationalencyklopedin "Världens 100 största språk 2007" The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007/2010 Because of the difficulty of imposing boundaries on a continuum, various counts of the Romance languages are given; Dalby lists 23 based on mutual intelligibility:David Dalby, 1999/2000, The Linguasphere register of the world’s languages and speech communities. Observatoire Linguistique, Linguasphere Press. Volume 2, p. 390-410 (zone 51). Oxford.[ ] Romance languages are the continuation of Vulgar Latin, the popular and colloquial sociolect of Latin spoken by soldiers, settlers, and merchants of the Roman Empire, as distinguished from the classical form of the language spoken by the Roman upper classes, the form in which the language was generally written. Between 350 BC and AD 150, the expansion of the Empire, together with its administrative and educational policies, made Latin the dominant native language in continental Western Europe. Latin also exerted a strong influence in southeastern Britain, the Roman province of Africa, the Roman province of Asia and the Balkans north of the Jireček Line. During the Empire's decline, and after its fragmentation and collapse in the fifth century, varieties of Latin began to diverge within each local area at an accelerated rate and eventually evolved into a continuum of recognizably different typologies. The overseas empires established by Portugal, Spain, and France from the fifteenth century onward spread their languages to the other continents to such an extent that about two-thirds of all Romance language speakers today live outside Europe. Despite other influences (e.g. substratum from pre-Roman languages, especially Continental Celtic languages; and superstratum from later Germanic or Slavic invasions), the phonology, morphology, and lexicon of all Romance languages consist mainly of evolved forms of Vulgar Latin. However, some notable differences occur between today's Romance languages and their Roman ancestor. With only one or two exceptions, Romance languages have lost the declension system of Latin and, as a result, have SVO sentence structure and make extensive use of prepositions. The term Romance comes from the Vulgar Latin adverb romanice, derived from Romanicus: for instance, in the expression romanice loqui, "to speak in Roman" (that is, the Latin vernacular), contrasted with latine loqui, "to speak in Latin" (Medieval Latin, the conservative version of the language used in writing and formal contexts or as a lingua franca), and with barbarice loqui, "to speak in Barbarian" (the non-Latin languages of the peoples living outside the Roman Empire). From this adverb the noun romance originated, which applied initially to anything written romanice, or "in the Roman vernacular". The word 'romance' with the modern sense of romance novel or love affair has the same origin. In the medieval literature of Western Europe, serious writing was usually in Latin, while popular tales, often focusing on love, were composed in the vernacular and came to be called "romances". Lexical and grammatical similarities among the Romance languages, and between Latin and each of them, are apparent from the following examples having the same meaning in various Romance lects: English: She always closesFrom the French substantive clos 'closed', itself from Latin clausus in T. F. Hoad, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English language, 1993, ISBN 0-19-283098-8, p. 80b. the window before she dinesFrom French verb diner, itself from Late Latin disjūnāre 'break one 's fast' in HOAD, p. 125b. Some of the divergence comes from semantic change: where the same root word has developed different meanings.  For example, the Portuguese word fresta is descended from Latin fenestra "window" (and is thus cognate to French fenêtre, Italian finestra,  Romanian fereastră and so on), but now means "skylight" and "slit".  Cognates may exist but have become rare, such as finiestra in Spanish, or dropped out of use entirely.  The Spanish and Portuguese terms defenestrar meaning "to throw through a window" and fenestrado meaning "replete with windows" also have the same root, but are later borrowings from Latin. Likewise, Portuguese also has the word cear, a cognate of Italian cenare and Spanish cenar, but uses it in the sense of "to have a late supper" in most varieties, while the preferred word for "to dine" is jantar (related to archaic Spanish yantar "to eat") because of semantic changes in the 19th century. Galician has both fiestra (from medieval fẽestra, the ancestor of standard Portuguese fresta) and the less frequently used ventá and xanela. As an alternative to lei (originally the genitive form), Italian has the pronoun ella, a cognate of the other words for "she", but it is hardly ever used in speaking. Spanish, Asturian, and Leonese ventana and Mirandese and Sardinian ventana come from Latin ventus "wind" (cf. English window, etymologically 'wind eye'), and Portuguese janela, Galician xanela, Mirandese jinela from Latin *ianuella "small opening", a derivative of ianua "door". Sardinian balcone (alternative for ventàna/bentàna) comes from Old Italian and is similar to other Romance languages such as French balcon (from Italian balcone), Portuguese balcão, Romanian balcon, Spanish balcón, Catalan balcó and Corsican balconi (alternative for purtellu).  Documentary evidence is limited about Vulgar Latin for the purposes of comprehensive research, and the literature is often hard to interpret or generalize. Many of its speakers were soldiers, slaves, displaced peoples, and forced resettlers, more likely to be natives of conquered lands than natives of Rome. Vulgar Latin is believed to have already had most of the features shared by all Romance languages, which distinguish them from Classical Latin, such as the almost complete loss of the Latin case system and its replacement by prepositions; the loss of the neuter gender and comparative inflections; replacement of some verb paradigms by innovations (e.g. the synthetic future gave way to an originally analytic strategy now typically formed by infinitive + evolved present indicative forms of 'have'); the use of articles; and the initial stages of the palatalization of the plosives /k/, /g/, and /t/. To some scholars, this suggests the form of Vulgar Latin that evolved into the Romance languages was around during the time of the Roman Empire (from the end of the first century BC), and was spoken alongside the written Classical Latin which was reserved for official and formal occasions. Other scholars argue that the distinctions are more rightly viewed as indicative of sociolinguistic and register differences normally found within any language. Both were mutually intelligible as one and the same language, which was true until the second half of the 7th century. However, within two hundred years Latin became a 'dead language' since "..the Romanized people of Europe could no longer understand texts that were read aloud or recited to them," i.e. Latin had ceased to be the mother-tongue and became a foreign language that had to be learned.(Vulgar Latin, Jozsef Herman, pp. 108-115. 1967, English trans. 1997, Penn State Univ. Press). During the political decline of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century, there were large-scale migrations into the empire, and the Latin-speaking world was fragmented into several independent states. Central Europe and the Balkans were occupied by the Germanic and Slavic tribes, as well as by the Huns, which isolated the Vlachs from the rest of Latin Europe. British Romance and African Romance, the forms of Vulgar Latin used in southeastern Britain and the Roman province of Africa, where it had been spoken by much of the urban population, disappeared in the Middle Ages (as did Pannonian Romance in what is now Hungary). But the Germanic tribes that had penetrated Italy, Gaul, and Hispania eventually adopted Latin/Romance and the remnants of Roman culture alongside existing inhabitants of those regions, and so Latin remained the dominant language there. Over the course of the 4th–8th centuries AD, Vulgar Latin, by this time highly dialectalized, broke up into discrete languages that were no longer mutually intelligible. Clear evidence of Latin change comes from the Reichenau Glosses, an 8th-century compilation of about 1,200 words from the 4th-century Latin Vulgate Bible (St. Jerome) that were no longer intelligible along with their 8th-century equivalents in proto-Franco-Provençal. The following are some examples with reflexes in several modern, closely related Romance languages for comparison: In all of the above examples, the words appearing in the fourth century Vulgate are the same words as would have been used in Classical Latin of c. 50 BC.  It is likely that some of these words had already disappeared from casual speech; but if so, they must have been still widely understood, as there is no recorded evidence that the common people of the time had difficulty understanding the language. By the 8th century, the situation was very different.  During the late 8th century, Charlemagne, holding that "Latin of his age was by classical standards intolerably corrupt", successfully imposed Classical Latin as an artificial written vernacular for Western Europe.  Unfortunately, this meant that parishioners could no longer understand the sermons of their priests, forcing the Council of Tours in 813 to issue an edict that priests needed to translate their speeches into the rustica romana lingua, an explicit acknowledgement of the reality of the Romance languages as separate languages from Latin. By this time, and possibly as early as the 6th century according to Price (1984), the Romance lects had split apart enough to be able to speak of separate Gallo-Romance, Ibero-Romance, Italo-Romance and Eastern Romance languages. Some researchers have postulated that the major divergences in the spoken dialects began in the 5th century, as the formerly widespread and efficient communication networks of the Western Roman Empire rapidly broke down, leading to the total disappearance of the Western Roman Empire by the end of the century. Unfortunately, the critical period between the 5th–10th centuries AD is poorly documented because little or no writing from the chaotic "Dark Ages" of the 5th–8th centuries has survived, and writing after that time was in consciously classicized Medieval Latin, with vernacular writing only beginning in earnest in the 11th or 12th centuries. Between the 10th and 13th centuries, some local vernaculars developed a written form and began to supplant Latin in many of its roles. In some countries, such as Portugal, this transition was expedited by force of law; whereas in others, such as Italy, many prominent poets and writers used the vernacular of their own accord&nbsp;– some of the most famous in Italy being Giacomo da Lentini and Dante Alighieri. The invention of the printing press brought a tendency towards greater uniformity of standard languages within political boundaries, at the expense of other Romance languages and dialects less favored politically. In France, for instance, the dialect spoken in the region of Paris gradually spread to the entire country, and the Occitan of the south lost ground.    The Romance language most widely spoken natively today is Spanish (Castilian), followed by Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian, which together cover a vast territory in Europe and beyond, and work as official and national languages in dozens of countries. French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Romanian are also official languages of the European Union. Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian, and Catalan are the official languages of the Latin Union; and French and Spanish are two of the six official languages of the United Nations. Outside of Europe, French, Portuguese and Spanish are spoken and enjoy official status in various countries that emerged from the respective colonial empires. French is one of the official languages of Canada, and it also has official status in many countries of Africa, as well as in some island nations in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Spanish is an official language in nine countries of South America, home to about half that continent's population; in six countries of Central America (all except Belize); and in Mexico. In the Caribbean, it is official in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. In Africa it is the official language of Equatorial Guinea. Portuguese, in its original homeland, Portugal, is spoken by virtually the entire population of 10 million. As the official language of Brazil, it is spoken by some 200 million people in that country, as well as by neighboring residents of eastern Paraguay and northern Uruguay, accounting for a little more than half the population of South America. It is the official language of six African countries (Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Equatorial Guinea,  and São Tomé and Príncipe), and is spoken as a first language by perhaps 30 million residents of that continent.See Portuguese in Africa. In Asia, Portuguese is co-official with other languages in East Timor and Macau, while most Portuguese-speakers in Asia—some 400,000See Portuguese in Asia and Oceania.—are in Japan due to return immigration of Japanese Brazilians. In North America 1,000,000 people speak Portuguese as their home language.See List of countries where Portuguese is an official language. In Oceania, Portuguese is the second most spoken Romance language, after French, due mainly to the number of speakers in East Timor. Its closest relative, Galician, has official status in the autonomous community of Galicia in Spain, together with Spanish. Although Italy also had some colonial possessions before World War II, its language did not remain official after the end of the colonial domination. As a result, Italian outside of Italy and Switzerland is now spoken only as a minority language by immigrant communities in North and South America and Australia. In some former Italian colonies in Africa—namely Libya, Eritrea and Somalia—it is spoken by a few educated people in commerce and government. Romania did not establish a colonial empire, but beyond its native territory in Southeastern Europe, it also spread to other countries on the Mediterranean (especially the other Romance countries, most notably Italy and Spain), and elsewhere such as Israel, where it is the native language of five percent of the population,1993 Statistical Abstract of Israel reports 250,000 speakers of Romanian in Israel, while the 1995 census puts the total figure of the Israeli population at 5,548,523 and is spoken by many more as a secondary language; this is due to the large numbers of Romanian-born Jews who moved to Israel after World War II. Some 2.6 million people in the former Soviet republic of Moldova speak a variety of Romanian, called variously Moldovan or Romanian by them. The total native speakers of Romance languages are divided as follows (with their ranking within the languages of the world in brackets): Catalan is unusual in that it is not the main language of any nation-state, other than Andorra, where it is official, but nonetheless has been able to compete and even gain speakers at the expense of the dominant language of its nation (Spanish); in fact, Catalan is the only minority European language whose long-term survival is probably not under threat. This is because unlike most minority-languages, Catalan has not remained linked to tradition and rural culture. It is co-official in Catalonia, the Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands, and recognized, but not official, in La Franja in Aragon. It is also spoken in the city of Alghero Catalan was used for high-level culture in the Middle Age and early modern times, and again from the 21st century. Besides it, a rich and lively popular culture (songs, literature, theatre, newspapers) has always existed and evolved in accordance with times. The result is a Catalan national feeling surviving the kingdoms union, and the belief that the Catalan language is a critical component of the separate ethnic identity of the Catalan people. This has allowed them to resist the historic persecutions and high immigration rates as well as the assimilationist urges that are in the process of destroying most of the remaining minority-language communities, even those that have strong government support (e.g. Irish language speakers). Galician, with more than a million native speakers, is official together with Spanish in Galicia, and has legal recognition in neighbouring territories in Castilla y León. A few other languages have official recognition on a regional or otherwise limited level; for instance, Asturian and Aragonese in Spain; Mirandese in Portugal; Friulan, Sardinian and Franco-Provençal in Italy; and Romansh in Switzerland. The remaining Romance languages survive mostly as spoken languages for informal contact. National governments have historically viewed linguistic diversity as an economic, administrative or military liability, as well as a potential source of separatist movements; therefore, they have generally fought to eliminate it, by extensively promoting the use of the official language, restricting the use of the "other" languages in the media, characterizing them as mere "dialects", or even persecuting them. As a result, all of these languages are considered endangered to varying degrees according to the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages, ranging from "vulnerable" (e.g. Sicilian and Venetian) to "severely endangered" (Arpitan, most of the Occitan varieties). Since the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, increased sensitivity to the rights of minorities has allowed some of these languages to start recovering their prestige and lost rights. Yet it is unclear whether these political changes will be enough to reverse the decline of minority Romance languages.    The classification of the Romance languages is inherently difficult, because most of the linguistic area is a dialect continuum, and in some cases political biases can come into play. Along with Latin (which is not included among the Romance languages) and a few extinct languages of ancient Italy, they make up the Italic branch of the Indo-European family.                  There are various schemes used to subdivide the Romance languages. Three of the most common schemes are as follows: The main subfamilies that have been proposed by Ethnologue within the various classification schemes for Romance languages are: The three-way division is made primarily based on the outcome of Vulgar Latin (Proto-Romance) vowels: Italo-Western is in turn split along the so-called La Spezia–Rimini Line in northern Italy, which divides the central and southern Italian languages from the so-called Western Romance languages to the north and west. The primary characteristics dividing the two are: In fact, the reality is somewhat more complex. All of the "southeast" characteristics apply to all languages southeast of the line, and all of the "northwest" characteristics apply to all languages in France and (most of) Spain. However, the Gallo-Italic languages are somewhere in between. All of these languages do have the "northwest" characteristics of lenition and loss of gemination. However: On top of this, the ancient Mozarabic language in southern Spain, at the far end of the "northwest" group, had the "southeast" characteristics of lack of lenition and palatalization of /k/ to . Certain languages around the Pyrenees (e.g. some highland Aragonese dialects) also lack lenition, and northern French dialects such as Norman and Picard have palatalization of /k/ to  (although this is possibly an independent, secondary development, since /k/ between vowels, i.e. when subject to lenition, developed to /dz/ rather than , as would be expected for a primary development). The usual solution to these issues is to create various nested subgroups. Western Romance is split into the Gallo-Iberian languages, in which lenition happens and which include nearly all the Western Romance languages, and the Pyrenean-Mozarabic group, which includes the remaining languages without lenition (and is unlikely to be a valid clade; probably at least two clades, one for Mozarabic and one for Pyrenean). Gallo-Iberian is split in turn into the Iberian languages (e.g. Spanish and Portuguese), and the larger Gallo-Romance languages (stretching from eastern Spain to northeast Italy). Probably a more accurate description, however, would be to say that there was a focal point of innovation located in central France, from which a series of innovations spread out as areal changes. The La Spezia–Rimini Line represents the farthest point to the southeast that these innovations reached, corresponding to the northern chain of the Apennine Mountains, which cuts straight across northern Italy and forms a major geographic barrier to further language spread. This would explain why some of the "northwest" features (almost all of which can be characterized as innovations) end at differing points in northern Italy, and why some of the languages in geographically remote parts of Spain (in the south, and high in the Pyrenees) are lacking some of these features. It also explains why the languages in France (especially standard French) seem to have innovated earlier and more completely than other Western Romance languages. Many of the "southeast" features also apply to the Eastern Romance languages (particularly, Romanian), despite the geographic discontinuity. Examples are lack of lenition, maintenance of intertonic vowels, use of vowel-changing plurals, and palatalization of /k/ to . (Gemination is missing, which may be an independent development, and /kt/ develops into /pt/ rather than either of the normal Italo-Western developments.) This has led some researchers to postulate a basic two-way East-West division, with the "Eastern" languages including Romanian and central and southern Italian. Sardinian does not fit into this picture at all. It is clear that Sardinian became linguistically independent from the remainder of the Romance languages at an extremely early date, possibly already by the first century BC. Sardinian contains a large number of archaic features, including total lack of palatalization of /k/ and /g/ and a large amount of vocabulary preserved nowhere else, including some items already archaic by the time of Classical Latin (first century BC). Sardinian has plurals in /s/ but no lenition of voiceless consonants (at least in most conservative Nuorese dialects) and a number of innovations unseen elsewhere: most famously, its unique vowel system, but also development of /au/ to /a/, a peculiar sort of lenition that operates as a synchronic feature, and use of su  cent , cantum "song" > chant . Some Romance languages have developed varieties which seem dramatically restructured as to their grammars or to be mixtures with other languages. It is not always clear whether they should be classified as Romance, pidgins, creole languages, or mixed languages. Some other languages, such as English, are sometimes thought of as creoles of semi-Romance ancestry. There are several dozens of creoles of French, Spanish, and Portuguese origin, some of them spoken as national languages in former European colonies. Creoles of French: Creoles of Spanish: Creoles of Portuguese:  Latin and the Romance languages have also served as the inspiration and basis of numerous auxiliary and constructed languages, so-called "neo-romantic languages". The concept was first developed in 1903 by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano, under the title Latino sine flexione.Peano, Giuseppe (1903). De Latino Sine Flexione. Lingua Auxiliare Internationale [ ], Revista de Mathematica (Revue de Mathématiques), Tomo VIII, pp. 74–83. Fratres Bocca Editores: Torino. He wanted to create a naturalistic international language, as opposed to an autonomous constructed language like Esperanto or Volapuk which were designed for maximal simplicity of lexicon and derivation of words. Peano used Latin as the base of his language, because at the time of his flourishing it was the de facto international language of scientific communication. Other languages developed since include Idiom Neutral, Occidental, Lingua Franca Nova, and most famously and successfully, Interlingua. Each of these languages has attempted to varying degrees to achieve a pseudo-Latin vocabulary as common as possible to living Romance languages. There are also languages created for artistic purposes only, such as Talossan. Because Latin is a very well attested ancient language, some amateur linguists have even constructed Romance languages that mirror real languages that developed from other ancestral languages. These include Brithenig (which mirrors Welsh), Breathanach (mirrors Irish), Wenedyk (mirrors Polish), Þrjótrunn (mirrors Icelandic), and Helvetian (mirrors German). Romance languages have a number of shared features across all languages: The most significant changes between Classical Latin and Proto-Romance (and hence all the modern Romance languages) relate to the reduction or loss of the Latin case system, and the corresponding syntactic changes that were triggered. The case system was drastically reduced from the vigorous six-case system of Latin. Although four cases can be constructed for Proto-Romance nouns (nominative, accusative, combined genitive/dative, and vocative), the vocative is marginal and present only in Romanian (where it may be an outright innovation), and of the remaining cases, no more than two are present in any one language. Romanian is the only modern Romance language with case marking on nouns, with a two-way opposition between nominative/accusative and genitive/dative.  Some of the older Gallo-Romance languages (in particular, Old French, Old Occitan, Old Sursilvan and Old Friulian, and in traces Old Catalan and Old Venetan) had an opposition between nominative and general oblique, and in Ibero-Romance languages, such as Spanish and Portuguese, as well as in Italian (see under Case), a couple of examples are found which preserve the old nominative. As in English, case is preserved better on pronouns. Concomitant with the loss of cases, freedom of word order was greatly reduced. Classical Latin had a generally verb-final (SOV) but overall quite free word order, with a significant amount of word scrambling and mixing of left-branching and right-branching constructions. The Romance languages eliminated word scrambling and nearly all left-branching constructions, with most languages developing a rigid SVO, right-branching syntax. (Old French, however, had a freer word order due to the two-case system still present, as well as a predominantly verb-second word order developed under the influence of the Germanic languages.) Some freedom, however, is allowed in the placement of adjectives relative to their head noun. In addition, some languages (e.g. Spanish, Romanian) have an "accusative preposition" (Romanian pe, Spanish "personal a") along with clitic doubling, which allows for some freedom in ordering the arguments of a verb. The Romance languages developed grammatical articles where Latin had none. Articles are often introduced around the time a robust case system falls apart in order to disambiguate the remaining case markers (which are usually too ambiguous by themselves) and to serve as parsing clues that signal the presence of a noun (a function formerly served by the case endings themselves). This was the pattern followed by the Romance languages: In the Romance languages that still preserved a functioning nominal case system (e.g. Romanian and Old French), only the combination of article and case ending serves to uniquely identify number and case (compare the similar situation in modern German). All Romance languages have a definite article (originally developed from ipse "self" but replaced in nearly all languages by ille "that (over there)") and an indefinite article (developed from ūnus "one"). Many also have a partitive article (dē "of" + definite article). Latin had a large number of syntactic constructions expressed through infinitives, participles, and similar nominal constructs. Examples are the ablative absolute, the accusative-plus-infinitive construction used for reported speech, gerundive constructions, and the common use of reduced relative clauses expressed through participles. All of these are replaced in the Romance languages by subordinate clauses expressed with finite verbs, making the Romance languages much more "verbal" and less "nominal" than Latin. Under the influence of the Balkan sprachbund, Romanian has progressed the furthest, largely eliminating the infinitive. (It is currently being revived, however, due to the increasing influence of other Romance languages.) Every language has a different set of vowels from every other.  Common characteristics are as follows: dental !colspan=2|Interdental !colspan=2|Dental/Alveolar !colspan=2|Post-alveolar !colspan=2|Palatal !colspan=2|Velar/Uvular !Glottal |- ! ! Voiceless !!

Stress in the Romance Languages mostly remains on the same syllable as in Latin, but various sound changes have made it no longer so predictable. Minimal pairs distinguished only by stress exist in some languages, e.g. Italian Papa  "Pope" vs. papà  "daddy", or Spanish límite  "[a] limit", present subjunctive limite  "[that] [I/he] limit" and preterite limité  "[I] limited". Erosion of unstressed syllables following the stress has caused most Spanish and Portuguese words to have either penultimate or ultimate stress: e.g. Latin trēdecim "thirteen" > Spanish trece, Portuguese treze; Latin amāre "to love" > Spanish/Portuguese amar. Most words with antepenultimate stress are learned borrowings from Latin, e.g. Spanish/Portuguese fábrica "factory" (the corresponding inherited word is Spanish fragua, Portuguese frágua "forge"). This process has gone even farther in French, with deletion of all post-stressed vowels, leading to consistent, predictable stress on the last syllable: e.g. Latin Stephanum "Stephen" > Old French Estievne > French Étienne ; Latin juvenis "young" > Old French juevne > French jeune .  This applies even to borrowings: e.g. Latin fabrica > French borrowing fabrique  (the inherited word in this case being monosyllabic forge  le</u>fonano'' {{IPA|[teˈlɛ.fo.na.no]}} "they telephone"; Spanish ''entregándomelo'' {{IPA|[en.tɾe.ˈɣan.do.me.lo]}} "delivering it to me"; Italian ''met<u>tia</u>mocene'' {{IPA|[meˈtːjaː.mo.tʃe.ne]}} "let's put some of it in there"; Portuguese ''dávamo-vo-lo'' {{IPA|[ˈda.vɐ.mu.vu.lu]}} "we were giving it to you".  Stress on verbs is almost completely predictable in Spanish and Portuguese, but less so in Italian.  ===Nominal morphology=== Nouns, adjectives, and pronouns can be marked for [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical case|case]]. Adjectives and pronouns must agree in all features with the noun they are bound to.  ====Number==== The Romance languages inherited from Latin two grammatical numbers, singular and plural; there is no trace of a [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] number.  ====Gender==== Most Romance languages have two [[grammatical gender]]s, masculine and feminine. The gender of animate nouns is generally natural (i.e. nouns referring to men are generally masculine, and vice versa), but for nonanimate nouns it is arbitrary.  Although Latin had a third gender (neuter), there is little trace of this in most languages. The biggest exception is [[Romanian language|Romanian]], where there is a productive class of "neuter" nouns, which include the descendants of many Latin neuter nouns and which behave like masculines in the singular and feminines in the plural, both in the endings used and in the agreement of adjectives and pronouns (e.g. ''un deget'' "one finger" vs. ''două degete'' "two fingers", cf. Latin ''digitus'', pl. ''digiti'').  Such nouns arose because of the identity of the Latin neuter singular ''-um'' with the masculine singular, and the identity of the Latin neuter plural ''-a'' with the feminine singular. A similar class exists in Italian, although it is no longer productive (e.g. ''il dito'' "the finger" vs. ''le dita'' "the fingers", ''l'uovo'' "the egg" vs. ''le uova'' "the eggs"). (A few isolated nouns in Latin had different genders in the singular and plural, but this was an unrelated phenomenon; this is similarly the case with a few French nouns, such as ''amour'', ''délice'', ''orgue''.)  Spanish also has vestiges of the neuter in two demonstrative adjectives: ''eso'', ''aquello'' (both meaning "that [one]"), the pronoun ''ello'' (meaning "it") and the article ''lo'' (used to intensify adjectives). Portuguese also has neuter demonstrative adjectives: "isto", "isso", "aquilo" (meaning "this [near me]", "this/that [near you]", "that [far from the both of us]").  ====Case==== Latin had an extensive case system, where all nouns were declined in six cases ([[nominative case|nominative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], and [[ablative case|ablative]]) and two numbers. Adjectives were additionally declined in three genders, leading to potentially 6 × 2 × 3 = 36 endings per adjective. In practice, some category combinations had identical endings to other combinations, but a basic adjective like ''bonus'' "good" still had 14 distinct endings.  {| class="wikitable" style="float: right; margin:10px" |+ Spanish pronoun inflections !

In most modern Romance languages, in fact, case is no longer marked at all on nouns, adjectives and determiners, and most forms are derived from the Latin accusative case. Much like English, however, case has survived somewhat better on pronouns.  Most pronouns have distinct nominative, accusative, genitive and possessive forms (cf. English "I, me, mine, my"). Many also have a separate dative form, a ''[[disjunctive pronoun|disjunctive]]'' form used after prepositions, and (in some languages) a special form used with the preposition ''con'' "with" (a conservative feature inherited from Latin forms such as ''mēcum'', ''tēcum'', ''nobiscum'').  {| class="wikitable" style="float: right; clear: right; margin:10px" |+ Spanish inflectional classes ! !! "boy" !! "girl" !! "man" !! "woman" |- ! Singular | chico || chica || hombre || mujer |- ! Plural | chicos || chicas || hombres || mujeres |}  The system of inflectional classes is also drastically reduced. The basic system is most clearly indicated in Spanish, where there are only three classes, corresponding to the first, second and third declensions in Latin: plural in ''-as'' (feminine), plural in ''-os'' (masculine), plural in ''-es'' (either masculine or feminine). The singular endings exactly track the plural, except the singular ''-e'' is dropped after certain consonants.  The same system underlines many other modern Romance languages, such as Portuguese, French and Catalan. In these languages, however, further sound changes have resulted in various irregularities. In Portuguese, for example, loss of /l/ and /n/ between vowels (with nasalization in the latter case) produces various irregular plurals (''nação – nações'' "nation(s)"; ''hotel – hotéis'' "hotel(s)").  In French and Catalan, loss of /o/ and /e/ in most unstressed final syllables has caused the ''-os'' and ''-es'' classes to merge. In French, merger of remaining /e/ with final /a/ into {{IPA|[ə]}}, and its subsequent loss, has completely obscured the original Romance system, and loss of final /s/ has caused most nouns to have identical pronunciation in singular and plural, although they are still marked differently in spelling (e.g. ''femme – femmes'' "woman – women", both pronounced {{IPA|/fam/}}).  {| class="wikitable" style="float: right; clear: right; margin:10px" |+ Romanian noun inflections !rowspan=2|Definiteness !! rowspan=2|Case !! colspan=2|"boy" !! colspan=2|"girl" |- !

In addition, there is a separate vocative case, enriched with native development and Slavic borrowings (see some examples [[Vocative case#Romanian|here]]) and the combination of noun with a following [[clitic]] definite article produces a separate set of "definite" inflections for nouns.  The inflectional classes of Latin have also survived more in Romanian than elsewhere, e.g. ''om – oameni'' "man – men" (Latin ''homo'' – ''homines''); ''corp – corpuri'' "body – bodies" (Latin ''corpus'' – ''corpora''). (Many other exceptional forms, however, are due to later sound changes or analogy, e.g. ''casă – case'' "house(s)" vs. ''lună – luni'' "moon(s)"; ''frate – fraţi'' "brother(s)" vs. ''carte – cărţi'' "book(s)" vs. ''vale – văi'' "valley(s)".)  In Italian, the situation is somewhere in between Spanish and Romanian. There are no case endings and relatively few classes, as in Spanish, but noun endings are generally formed with vowels instead of /s/, as in Romanian: ''amico – amici'' "friend(s) (masc.)", ''amica – amiche'' "friend(s) (fem.)"; ''cane – cani'' "dog(s)". The masculine plural ''amici'' is thought to reflect the Latin nominative plural ''-ī'' rather than accusative plural ''-ōs'' (Spanish ''-os''); however, the other plurals are thought to stem from special developments of Latin ''-ās'' and ''-ēs''.  {| class="wikitable" style="float: right; clear: right; margin:10px" |+Evolution of case in various Romance languages (Latin ''bonus'' "good") ! !!

Ablative | bonīs |}  A different type of noun inflection survived into the medieval period in a number of western Romance languages ([[Old French]], [[Old Occitan]], and the older forms of a number of [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]]). This inflection distinguished nominative from oblique, grouping the accusative case with the oblique, rather than with the nominative as in Romanian.  The oblique case in these languages generally inherits from the Latin accusative; as a result, masculine nouns have distinct endings in the two cases while most feminine nouns do not.  A number of different inflectional classes are still represented at this stage. For example, the difference in the nominative case between masculine ''li voisins'' "the neighbor" and ''li pere'' "the father", and feminine ''la riens'' "the thing" vs. ''la fame'' "the woman", faithfully reflects the corresponding Latin inflectional differences (''vicīnus'' vs. ''pater'', ''fēmina'' vs. ''rēs'').  A number of synchronically quite irregular differences between nominative and oblique reflect direct inheritances of Latin third-declension nouns with two different stems (one for the nominative singular, one for all other forms), most with of which had a stress shift between nominative and the other forms: ''li ber – le baron'' "baron" (''<u>ba</u>rō'' – ''ba<u>rō</u>nem''); ''la suer – la seror'' "sister" (''<u>so</u>ror'' – ''so<u>rō</u>rem''); ''li prestre – le prevoire'' "priest" (''<u>pres</u>byter'' – ''pres<u>by</u>terem''); ''li sire – le seigneur'' "lord" (''<u>se</u>nior'' – ''se<u>niōr</u>em''); ''li enfes – l'enfant'' "child" (''<u>in</u>fāns'' – ''in<u>fan</u>tem'').<ref name="kibler">{{cite book|last1=Kibler |first1=William W. |title=An introduction to Old French |year=1984 |publisher=Modern Language Association of America |location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|36–39}}  A few of these multi-stem nouns derive from Latin forms without stress shift, e.g. ''li om – le ome'' "man" (''<u>ho</u>mō'' – ''<u>ho</u>minem''). All of these multi-stem nouns refer to people; other nouns with stress shift in Latin (e.g. ''<u>a</u>mor'' – ''a<u>mō</u>rem'' "love") have not survived. Interestingly, some of the same nouns with multiple stems in [[Old French]] or [[Old Occitan]] have come down in Italian in the nominative rather than the accusative (e.g. ''uomo'' "man" < ''<u>ho</u>mō'', ''moglie'' "wife" < ''<u>mu</u>lier''), suggesting that a similar system existed in pre-literary Italian.  The modern situation in [[Sursilvan]] (one of the [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]]) is unique in that the original nominative/oblique distinction has been reinterpreted as a predicative/attributive distinction:<ref name="harris-vincent">{{cite book| title=The Romance Languages |last1=Harris |first1=Martin |last2=Vincent |first2=Nigel |year=1988 |location=London |publisher=Routledge}}</ref>{{rp|381}} * ''il hotel ej vɛɲiws <u>natsionalizaws</u>'' "the hotel has been nationalized" * ''il hotel <u>natsionalizaw</u>'' "the nationalized hotel"{{clear}}  ===Pronouns, determiners=== As described above, case marking on pronouns is much more extensive than for nouns. [[Determiner (linguistics)|Determiners]] (e.g. words such as "a", "the", "this") are also marked for case in Romanian.  Most Romance languages have the following sets of pronouns and determiners: * [[Personal pronoun]]s, in three persons and two genders. * A [[reflexive pronoun]], used when the object is the same as the subject. This approximately corresponds to English "-self", but separate forms exist only in the third person, with no number marking. * Definite and indefinite [[article (grammar)|articles]], and in some languages, a [[partitive article]] that expresses the concept of "some". * A two-way or three-way distinction among [[demonstrative]]s. Many languages have a three-way distinction of distance (near me, near you, near him) not paralleled in current English, but formerly present as "this/that/yon". * [[Relative pronoun]]s and [[interrogative]]s, with the same forms used for both (similar to English "who" and "which"). * Various [[indefinite pronoun]]s and determiners (e.g. Spanish ''algún'' "some", ''alguien'' "someone", ''algo'' "something"; ''ningún'' "no", ''nadie'' "no one"; ''todo'' "every"; ''cada'' "each"; ''mucho'' "much/many/a lot", ''poco'' "few/little"; ''otro'' "other/another"; etc.).  ====Personal pronouns==== Unlike in English, a separate neuter personal pronoun ("it") generally does not exist, but both singular and plural third person distinguish masculine from feminine. Also, as described above, case is marked on pronouns even though it is not usually on nouns, similar to English. As in English, there are forms for [[nominative case]] ([[subject pronoun]]s), [[oblique case]] ([[object pronoun]]s), and [[genitive case]] ([[possessive pronoun]]s); in addition, third-person pronouns distinguish accusative and dative. There is also an additional set of possessive determiners, distinct from the genitive case of the personal pronoun; this corresponds to the English difference between "my, your" and "mine, yours".  =====Development from Latin===== The Romance languages do not retain the Latin third-person personal pronouns, but have innovated a separate set of third-person pronouns by borrowing the demonstrative ''ille'' ("that (over there)"), and creating a separate reinforced demonstrative by attaching a variant of ''ecce'' "behold!" (or "here is ...") to the pronoun.  Similarly, in place of the genitive of the Latin pronouns, the Romance languages adopted the reflexive possessive, which then serves indifferently as both reflexive and non-reflexive possessive. Note that the reflexive, and hence the third-person possessive, is unmarked for the gender of the person being referred to. Hence, although gendered possessive forms do exist—e.g. Portuguese ''seu'' (masc.) vs. ''sua'' (fem.)—these refer to the gender of the object possessed, not the possessor.  The gender of the possessor needs to be made clear by a collocation such as French ''la voiture à lui/elle'', Portuguese ''o carro dele/dela'', literally "the car of him/her". (In spoken [[Brazilian Portuguese]], these collocations are the usual way of expressing the third-person possessive, since the former possessive ''seu carro'' now has the meaning "your car".)  The same demonstrative ''ille'' was borrowed to create the definite article (see below), which explains the similarity in form between personal pronoun and definite article. When the two are different, it is usually because of differing degrees of phonetic reduction. Generally, the personal pronoun is unreduced (beyond normal sound change), while the article has suffered various amounts of reduction, e.g. Spanish ''ella'' "she" < ''illa'' vs. ''la'' "the (fem.)" < ''-la'' < ''illa''.  =====Clitic pronouns===== Object pronouns in Latin were normal words, but in the Romance languages they have become [[clitic]] forms, which must stand adjacent to a verb and merge phonologically with it. Originally, object pronouns could come either before or after the verb; sound change would often produce different forms in these two cases, with numerous additional complications and contracted forms when multiple clitic pronouns cooccurred.  Catalan still largely maintains this system with a [[Catalan personal pronouns|highly complex clitic pronoun system]]. Most languages, however, have simplified this system by undoing some of the clitic mergers and requiring clitics to stand in a particular position relative to the verb (usually after imperatives, before other finite forms, and either before or after non-finite forms depending on the language).  When a pronoun cannot serve as a clitic, a separate [[disjunctive pronoun|disjunctive]] form is used. These result from dative object pronouns pronounced with stress (which causes them to develop differently from the equivalent unstressed pronouns), or from subject pronouns.  Most Romance languages are [[null subject language]]s. The subject pronouns are used only for emphasis and take the stress, and as a result are not clitics. In French, however (as in [[Friulian language|Friulian]] and in some [[Gallo-Italian languages]] of northern Italy), verbal agreement marking has degraded to the point that subject pronouns have become mandatory, and have turned into clitics. These forms cannot be stressed, so for emphasis the disjunctive pronouns must be used in combination with the clitic subject forms. Friulian and the Gallo-Italian languages have actually gone further than this and merged the subject pronouns onto the verb as a new type of verb agreement marking, which must be present even when there is a subject noun phrase. (Some non-standard varieties of French treat [[disjunctive pronoun]]s as arguments and [[clitic|clitic pronouns]] as agreement markers.<ref>[[Henri Wittmann]]. {{PDFlink|[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1998a-fpparis.pdf "Le français de Paris dans le français des Amériques."]|52.1&nbsp;KB}}, ''Proceedings of the International Congress of Linguists'' 16.0416 (Paris, 20–25 juillet 1997). Oxford: Pergamon (CD edition).</ref>)  =====Familiar–formal distinction===== In medieval times, most Romance languages developed a distinction between familiar and polite second-person pronouns (a so-called ''[[T-V distinction]]''), similar to the former English distinction between familiar "thou" and polite "you". As in English, this generally developed by appropriating the plural second-person pronoun to serve in addition as a polite singular. French is still at this stage, with familiar singular ''tu'' vs. formal or plural ''vous''. In cases like this, the pronoun requires plural agreement in all cases whenever a single affix marks both person and number (as in verb agreement endings and object and possessive pronouns), but singular agreement elsewhere where appropriate (e.g. ''vous-même'' "yourself" vs. ''vous-mêmes'' "yourselves").  Many languages, however, innovated further in developing an even more polite pronoun, generally composed of a noun phrase (e.g. Portuguese ''vossa mercê'' "your mercy", progressively reduced to ''vossemecê'', ''vosmecê'' and finally ''você'') and taking third-person singular agreement. A plural equivalent was created at the same time or soon after (Portuguese ''vossas mercês'', reduced to ''vocês''), taking third-person plural agreement. Spanish innovated similarly, with ''usted(es)'' from earlier ''vuestra(s) merced(es)''.  In Portuguese and Spanish (as in other languages with similar forms), the "extra-polite" forms in time came to be the normal polite forms, and the former polite (or plural) second-person ''vos'' knocked down to a familiar form, either becoming a familiar plural (as in European Spanish) or a familiar singular (as in many varieties of Latin American Spanish). In the latter case, it either competes with the original familiar singular ''tu'' (as in Guatemala), displaces it entirely (as in Argentina), or is itself displaced (as in Mexico, except in Chiapas). In American Spanish, the gap created by the loss of familiar plural ''vos'' was filled by originally polite ''ustedes'', with the result that there is no familiar/polite distinction in the plural, just as in the original ''tu/vos'' system.  A similar path was followed by Italian and Romanian. Romanian uses ''dumneavoastră'' "your lordship", while Italian the former polite phrase ''sua eccellenza'' "your excellency" has simply been supplanted by the corresponding pronoun ''Ella'' or ''Lei'' (literally "she", but capitalized when meaning "you"). As in European Spanish, the original second-person plural ''voi'' serves as familiar plural. (In Italy, during [[fascism|fascist]] times leading up to [[World War II]], ''voi'' was resurrected as a polite singular, and discarded again afterwards, although it remains in some southern dialects.)  Portuguese innovated again in developing a new extra-polite pronoun ''o senhor'' "the sir", which in turn downgraded ''você''. Hence, modern European Portuguese has a three-way distinction between "familiar" ''tu'', "equalizing" ''você'' and "polite" ''o senhor''. (The original second-person plural ''vós'' was discarded centuries ago in speech, and is used today only in translations of the Bible, where ''tu'' and ''vós'' serve as universal singular and plural pronouns, respectively.)  [[Brazilian Portuguese]], however, has diverged from this system, and most dialects simply use ''você'' (and plural ''vocês'') as a general-purpose second person pronoun, combined with ''te'' (from ''tu'') as the clitic object pronoun. The form ''o senhor'' is sometimes used in speech, but only in situations where an English speaker would say "sir" or "ma'am". The result is that second-person verb forms have disappeared, and the whole pronoun system has been radically realigned. However that is the case only in the spoken language of central and southern Brazil, with the northern areas of the country still largely preserving the second person verb form and the "tu" and "você" distinction.  ====Articles==== Latin had no articles as such. The closest definite article was the non-specific demonstrative ''is, ea, id'' meaning approximately "this/that/the". The closest indefinite articles were the indefinite determiners ''aliquī, aliqua, aliquod'' "some (non-specific)" and ''certus'' "a certain".  Romance languages have both indefinite and definite articles, but none of the above words form the basis for either of these. Usually the definite article is derived from the Latin demonstrative ''ille'' ("that"), but some languages (e.g. [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], and some dialects spoken around the Pyrenees) have forms from ''ipse'' (emphatic, as in "I myself"). The indefinite article everywhere is derived from the number ''ūnus'' ("one").  Some languages, e.g. French and Italian, have a [[partitive article]] that approximately translates as "some". This is used either with [[mass noun]]s or with plural nouns—both cases where the indefinite article cannot occur. A partitive article is used (and in French, required) whenever a bare noun refers to specific (but unspecified or unknown) quantity of the noun, but not when a bare noun refers to a class in general. For example, the partitive would be used in both of the following sentences: :* I want milk. :* Men arrived today. But neither of these: :* Milk is good for you. :* I hate men. The sentence "Men arrived today", however, (presumably) means "some specific men arrived today" rather than "men, as a general class, arrived today" (which would mean that there were no men before today). On the other hand, "I hate men" does mean "I hate men, as a general class" rather than "I hate some specific men".  As in many other cases, French has developed the farthest from Latin in its use of articles. In French, nearly all nouns, singular and plural, must be accompanied by an article (either indefinite, definite, or partitive) or demonstrative pronoun.  Due to pervasive sound changes, most nouns are pronounced identically in the singular and plural, and there is often heavy homonymy between nouns and identically pronounced words of other classes. For example, all of the following are pronounced {{IPA|/sɛ̃/}}: ''sain'' "healthy"; ''saint'' "saint, holy"; ''sein'' "breast"; ''ceins'' "(you) put on, gird"; ''ceint'' "(he) puts on, girds"; ''ceint'' "put on, girded"; and the equivalent noun and adjective plural forms ''sains, saints, seins, ceints''. The article helps identify the noun forms ''saint'' or ''sein'', and distinguish singular from plural; likewise, the mandatory subject of verbs helps identify the verb ''ceint''. In more conservative Romance languages, neither articles nor subject pronouns are necessary, since all of the above words are pronounced differently (In Italian, for example, the equivalents are ''sano, santo, seno, cingi, cinge, cinto, sani, santi, seni, cinti'', where all vowels and consonants are pronounced as written, and {{angbr|s}} and {{angbr|c}} are clearly distinct from each other).  Latin, at least originally, had a three-way distinction among demonstrative pronouns (''hic'' ''iste'' ''ille'') corresponding to first, second and third persons. Such a distinction is not reflected in modern English, but formerly existed as "this" vs. "that" vs. "yon(der)". In urban Latin of Rome, ''iste'' came to have a specifically derogatory meaning, but this innovation apparently did not reach the provinces and is not reflected in the modern Romance languages. A number of these languages still have such a three-way distinction, although ''hic'' has been lost and the other pronouns have shifted somewhat in meaning. For example, Spanish has ''este'' "this" vs. ''ese'' "that (near you)" vs. ''aquel'' (fem. ''aquella'') "that (over yonder)". The Spanish pronouns derive, respectively, from Latin ''iste'' ''ipse'' ''accu''-''ille'', where ''accu-'' is an emphatic prefix derived from ''eccum'' "behold it!", possibly with influence from ''atque'' "and".<ref>''ipse'' originally meant "self", as in ''ego'' ''ipse'' or ''egomet'' ''ipse'' "I myself". ''ipse'' later shifted to mean "the" (still reflected in Sardinian and in the Catalan spoken in the [[Balearic Islands]]), and still later came to be a demonstrative pronoun. From ''-met'' ''ipse'' the emphatic ([[superlative]]) form ''metipsimum'' was created, later evolving into ''medisimum'' and eventually Spanish ''mismo'', French ''même'', Italian ''medesimo'', which replaced both Latin ''ipse'' "self" and ''idem'' "same". The alternative form ''metipse'' eventually produced Catalan ''mateix'', [[Old Portuguese]] ''medês''. The normal Italian equivalent, however, is ''stesso'', derived from the combination ''iste''-''ipse''.</ref>  Reinforced demonstratives such as ''accu''-''ille'' became necessary once ''ille'' came to be used as an article as well as a demonstrative. Such forms were often created even when not strictly needed to distinguish otherwise ambiguous forms. Italian, for example, has both ''questo'' "this" (''eccu''-''istum'') and ''quello'' "that" (''eccu''-''illum''), in addition to dialectal ''codesto'' "that (near you)" (''eccu-tē-istum''). French generally prefers forms derived from bare ''ecce'' "behold", as in the pronoun ''ce'' "this one/that one" (earlier ''ço'', from ''ecce''-''hoc'') and the determiner ''ce/cet'' "this/that" (earlier ''cest'', from ''ecce''-''istum'').  Reinforced forms are likewise common in [[locative adverb]]s (words such as English ''here'' and ''there''), based on related Latin forms such as ''hic'' "this" vs. ''hīc'' "here", ''hāc'' "this way", and ''ille'' "that" vs. ''illīc'' "there", ''illāc'' "that way". Here again French prefers bare ''ecce'' while Spanish and Italian prefer ''eccum'' (French ''ici'' "here" vs. Spanish ''aquí'', Italian ''qui''). In western languages such as Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan, doublets and triplets arose such as Portuguese ''aqui, acá, cá'' "(to) here" (''accu''-''hīc'', ''accu''-''hāc'', ''eccu''-''hāc''). From these, a prefix ''a-'' was extracted, from which forms like ''aí'' "there (near you)" (''a-(i)bi'') and ''ali'' "there (over yonder)" (''a-(i)llīc'') were created; compare Catalan neuter pronouns ''açò'' (''acce''-''hoc'') "this", ''això'' (''a-(i)psum''-''hoc'') "that (near you)", ''allò'' (''a-(i)llum''-''hoc'') "that (yonder)".  Subsequent changes often reduced the number of demonstrative distinctions. Standard Italian, for example, has only a two-way distinction "this" vs. "that", as in English, with second-person and third-person demonstratives combined. In Catalan, however, a former three-way distinction ''aquest, aqueix, aquell'' has recently been reduced differently, with first-person and second-person demonstratives combined. Hence ''aquest'' means either "this" or "that (near you)"; on the phone, ''aquest'' is used to refer both to speaker and addressee.  [[Old French]] had a similar distinction to Italian (''cist/cest'' vs. ''cil/cel''), both of which could function as either adjectives or pronouns. Modern French, however, has no distinction between "this" and "that": ''ce/cet, cette'' < ''cest, ceste'' is only an adjective, and ''celui, celle'' < ''cel lui, celle'' is only a pronoun, and both forms indifferently mean either "this" or "that". (The distinction between "this" and "that" can be made, if necessary, by adding the suffixes ''-ci'' "here" or ''-là'' "there", e.g. ''cette femme-ci'' "this woman" vs. ''cette femme-là'' "that woman", but this is rarely done except when specifically necessary to distinguish two entities from each other.)  ===Verbal morphology=== {{See also|Romance verbs}} {|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" |+Correspondence between Latin and Romance tenses !

Several languages (for example, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish) have also imperfect and pluperfect subjunctives, although it is not unusual to have just one subjunctive equivalent for preterit and imperfect (e.g. no unique subjunctive equivalent in Italian of the so-called ''passato remoto''). Portuguese, and until recently Spanish, also have future and future perfect subjunctives, which have no equivalent in Latin. * An imperative mood, for direct commands. * Three [[non-finite verb|non-finite forms]]: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. * Distinct active and passive voices, as well as an [[impersonal passive voice]]. * Note that, although these ''categories'' are largely inherited from Classical Latin, many of the ''forms'' are either newly constructed or inherited from different categories (e.g. the Romance imperfect subjunctive most commonly is derived from the Latin pluperfect subjunctive, while the Romance pluperfect subjunctive is derived from a new [[present perfect]] tense with the auxiliary verb placed in the imperfect subjunctive).  Several tenses and aspects, especially of the indicative mood, have been preserved with little change in most languages, as shown in the following table for the Latin verb ''dīcere'' (to say), and its descendants.  :{|class="wikitable" style="font-size: 85%" |- ! rowspan=2 | !! rowspan=2 | Infinitive !! colspan=3 | Indicative !!

The passive voice, which was mostly synthetic in classical Latin, has been completely replaced with compound forms. * Owing to sound changes which made it [[homonym|homophonous]] with the preterite, the Latin future indicative tense was dropped, and replaced with a periphrasis of the form [[infinitive]] + present tense of ''habēre'' (to have). Eventually, this structure was [[grammaticalisation|reanalysed]] as a new [[future tense]]. * In a similar process, an entirely new [[Conditional mood#Romance languages|conditional form]] was created. * While the synthetic [[grammatical voice|passive voice]] of classical Latin was abandoned in favour of [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] constructions, most of the active voice remained in use. However, several tenses have changed meaning, especially subjunctives. For example: ** The Latin pluperfect indicative became a [[conditional mood|conditional]] in Sicilian, and an imperfect [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] in Spanish. ** The Latin pluperfect subjunctive developed into an imperfect subjunctive in all languages except [[Romansh language|Romansh]], where it became a conditional, and Romanian, where it became a [[pluperfect|pluperfect indicative]]. ** The Latin preterite subjunctive, together with the future perfect indicative, became a future subjunctive in Old Spanish, Portuguese, and [[Galician language|Galician]]. ** The Latin imperfect subjunctive became a personal [[infinitive]] in Portuguese and Galician. * Many Romance languages have two [[copula (linguistics)|verbs "to be"]]. One is derived from Vulgar Latin *''essere'' < Latin ''esse'' "to be" with an admixture of forms derived from ''sedēre'' "to sit", and is used mostly for essential attributes; the other is derived from ''stāre'' "to stand", and mostly used for temporary states. This development is most notable in Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan. In French, Italian and Romanian, the derivative of ''stāre'' largely preserved an earlier meaning of "to stand/to stay", although in modern Italian, ''stare'' is used in a few constructions where English would use "to be", as in ''sto bene'' "I am well". In [[Old French]], the derivatives of *''essere'' and ''stāre'' were ''estre'' and ''ester'', respectively. In modern French, ''estre'' persists as ''être'' "to be" while ''ester'' has been lost as a separate verb; but the former imperfect of ''ester'' is used as the modern imperfect of ''être'' (e.g. ''il était'' "he was"), replacing the irregular forms derived from Latin (e.g. ''ere(t), iere(t)'' < ''erat''). In Italian, the two verbs share the same past participle, ''stato''. ''sedēre'' persists most notably in the future of *''essere'' (e.g. Spanish/Portuguese/French/etc. ''ser-'', Italian ''sar-''), although in [[Old French]] the future is a direct derivation from Latin, e.g. ''(i)ert'' "he will be" < ''erit''. See [[Romance copula]] for further information. For a more detailed illustration of how the verbs have changed with respect to classical Latin, see [[Romance verbs]]. * During the [[Renaissance]], Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and a few other Romance languages developed a [[progressive aspect]] which did not exist in Latin. In French, progressive constructions remain very limited, the [[imperfective|imperfect]] generally being preferred, as in Latin. * Many Romance languages now have a verbal construction analogous to the [[present perfect]] of English. In some, it has taken the place of the old [[preterite]] (at least in the vernacular); in others, the two coexist with somewhat different meanings (cf. English ''I did'' vs. ''I have done''). A few examples: ** preterite only: Galician, Asturian, Sicilian, Leonese, Portuguese, some dialects of Spanish; ** preterite and present perfect: Catalan, Occitan, standard Spanish; ** present perfect predominant, preterite now literary: French, Romanian, several dialects of Italian, some dialects of Spanish; ** present perfect only: Romansh  Note that in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], the synthetic preterite is predominantly a literary tense, except in [[Valencian]]; but an analytic preterite (formed using an auxiliary ''vadō'', which in other languages signals the future) persists in speech, with the same meaning. In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], a morphological present perfect does exist but has a different meaning (closer to "I have been doing"), and is rare in practice.  The following are common features of the Romance languages (inherited from [[Vulgar Latin]]) that are different from Classical Latin: * Adjectives generally follow the noun they modify. * The normal clause structure is [[subject–verb–object|SVO]], rather than [[subject–object–verb|SOV]], and is much less flexible than in Latin. * Many Latin constructions involving nominalized verbal forms (e.g. the use of accusative plus infinitive in [[free indirect speech|indirect discourse]] and the use of the [[Latin grammar|ablative absolute]]) were dropped in favor of constructions with subordinate clause. Exceptions can be found in Italian, for example, Latin ''tempore permittente'' > Italian ''tempo permettendo''; L. ''hoc facto'' > I. ''ciò fatto''.  ===Lexicon===  ====Borrowing==== Romance languages have borrowed heavily, though mostly from other Romance languages. However, some, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and French, have borrowed heavily from other language groups. Vulgar Latin borrowed first from indigenous languages of the Roman empire, and during the [[Migration Period|Germanic folk movements]], from [[Germanic languages]], especially Gothic. Notable examples are *''blancus'' "white", replacing native ''albus'' (but Romansh ''alv'', Dalmatian ''jualb'', Romanian ''alb''); *''guerra'' "war", replacing native ''bellum''; and the words for the [[cardinal directions]], where [[cognate]]s of English "north", "south", "east" and "west" replaced the native words ''septentriō'', ''merīdiēs'' (also "noon; midday nap"; cf. Romanian ''meriză''), ''oriens'', and ''occidens''. (See [[History of French#The Franks|History of French – The Franks]].) Some [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] words were incorporated into the core vocabulary, partly for words with no Latin equivalent (''betulla'' "birch", ''camisia'' "shirt", ''cerevisia'' "beer"), but in some cases replacing Latin vocabulary (''gladius'' "sword", replacing ''ensis''; ''cambiāre'' "to exchange", replacing ''mūtāre'' except in Romanian and Portuguese; ''carrus'' "cart", replacing ''currus''; ''pettia'' "piece", largely displacing ''pars'' (later resurrected) and eliminating ''frustum''). Many Greek words also entered the lexicon, {{citation needed span|e.g. ''spatha'' "sword" (Greek: {{lang|gr|σπάθη}} ''spathe'',<ref>{{LSJ|spa/qh|σπάθη|ref}}.</ref><ref>Harper, Douglas. "[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=spatha spatha]". Online Etymology Dictionary.</ref> replacing ''gladius'' which shifted to "iris", cf. French ''épée'', Spanish ''espada'', Italian ''spada ''and Romanian ''spată''); ''cara'' "face" (Greek: κάρα ''kara'',<ref>{{LSJ|ka/ra1|κάρα|shortref}}.</ref> partly replacing ''faciēs''); ''colpe'' "blow" (Greek: κόλαφος ''kolaphos'',<ref>{{LSJ|ko/lafos|κόλαφος|shortref}}.</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|coup}}</ref> replacing ''ictus'', cf. Spanish ''golpe'', French ''coup''); ''cata'' "each" (Greek: {{lang|gr|κατά}} ''kata'',<ref>{{LSJ|kata/1|κατά|shortref}}.</ref> replacing ''quisque''); common suffixes *''-ijāre/-izāre'' (Greek: {{lang|gr|-ίζειν}} ''-izein'',<ref>{{OEtymD|-ize}}.</ref> French ''oyer/-iser'', Spanish ''-ear/-izar'', Italian ''-eggiare/-izzare'', etc.), ''-ista'' (Greek: {{lang|gr|-ιστής}} ''-istes''<ref>{{OEtymD|-ist}}</ref>).|date=January 2016|reason=Sources (specialised) needed that substantiate, among other things, the replacements throughout Romance languages in general and in particular the stated replacement examples; another notable problem is that LSJ does not cover, at least most of the time, later Greek and its interplay with Latin; e.g. 'kolaphos' is indeed "a blow with the fist" or "slap" in later Greek and Latin but this meaning is not covered in LSJ apart from "cf. Lat. colaphus"; 'spatha' - instead of 'spathe' - Greek form not covered. See also 'reason' of clarification needed tag.}}{{Clarify|date=January 2016|reason=Among other things a rewording is needed; for example: 'colpe' (L.L. ''colpus'') is not the original Greek form or possibly Greek at all when stated in this form; 'kata' (latinised form: 'cata') is a preposition in Greek, it does not mean "each"; see also 'reason' of cn tag.}}  ====Lexical innovation==== Many basic nouns and verbs, especially those that were short or had irregular morphology, were replaced by longer derived forms with regular morphology. Nouns, and sometimes adjectives, were often replaced by [[diminutive]]s, e.g. ''auris'' "ear" > ''auricula'' (orig. "outer ear") > ''oricla'' (Sardinian ''origra'', Italian ''orecchia/o'', Portuguese ''orelha'', etc.); ''avis'' "bird" > ''avicellus'' (orig. "chick, nestling") > ''aucellu'' (Occitan ''aucèl'', Friulian ''ucel'', French ''oiseau'', etc.); ''caput'' "head" > ''capitium'' (Portuguese ''cabeça'', Spanish ''cabeza'', French ''chevet'' "headboard"; but reflexes of ''caput'' were retained also, sometimes without change of meaning); ''vetus'' "old" > ''vetulus'' > ''veclus'' (Dalmatian ''vieklo'', Italian ''vecchio'', Portuguese ''velho'', etc.). Sometimes [[augmentative]] constructions were used instead: ''piscis'' "fish" > Old French ''peis'' > ''peisson'' (orig. "big fish") > French ''poisson''. Verbs were often replaced by [[frequentative]] constructions: ''canere'' "to sing" > ''cantāre''; ''iacere'' "to throw" > ''iactāre'' > *''iectāre'' (Italian ''gettare'', Portuguese ''jeitar'', Spanish ''echar'', etc.); ''iuvāre'' > ''adiūtāre'' (Italian ''aiutare'', Spanish ''ayudar'', French ''aider'', etc.); ''vēnārī'' "hunt" > replaced by *''captiāre'' "to hunt", frequentative of ''capere'' "to seize" (Italian ''cacciare'', Portuguese ''caçar'', Romansh ''catschar'', French ''chasser'', etc.).  Many Classical Latin words became archaic or poetic and were replaced by more colloquial terms: ''equus'' "horse" > ''caballus'' (orig. "nag") (but ''equa'' "mare" remains, cf. Spanish ''yegua''); ''domus'' "house" > ''casa'' (orig. "hut"); ''ignis'' "fire" > ''focus'' (orig. "hearth"); ''strāta'' "street" > ''rūga'' (orig. "furrow") or ''callis'' (orig. "footpath") (but ''strāta'' is continued in Italian ''strada''). In some cases, terms from common occupations became generalized: ''invenīre'' "to find" > [[Ibero-Romance]] ''(f)afflāre'' (orig. "to sniff out", in hunting, cf. Spanish ''hallar'', Portuguese ''achar''); ''advenīre'' "to arrive" > [[Ibero-Romance]] ''plicāre'' (orig. "to fold (sails)", cf. Spanish ''llegar'', Portuguese ''chegar''), elsewhere ''arripāre'' (orig. "to harbor at a riverbank", cf. Italian ''arrivare'', French ''arriver'') (''advenīre'' is continued with the meaning "to achieve, manage to do"; cf. Middle French ''aveindre'') . The same thing sometimes happened to religious terms, due to the pervasive influence of Christianity: ''loquī'' "to speak" > ''parabolāre'' (orig. "to tell parables", cf. Occitan ''paraular'', French ''parler'', Italian ''parlare '') or ''fabulārī'' (orig. "to tell stories", cf. Spanish ''hablar'', Portuguese ''falar''), based on Jesus' way of speaking in [[parable]]s.  Many prepositions were used as verbal particles to make new roots and verb stems, e.g. Italian ''estrarre'' "to extract" from Latin ''ex-'' "out of" and ''trahere'' "to pull" (Italian ''trarre''), or to augment already existing words, e.g. French ''coudre'', Italian ''cucire'', Portuguese ''coser'' "to sew", from ''cōnsuere'' "to sew up", from ''suere'' "to sew", with total loss of the bare stem. Many prepositions weakened and commonly became compounded, e.g. ''de ex'' > French ''dès'' "as of", ''ab ante'' > Italian ''avanti'' "forward". Some words derived from phrases, e.g. Portuguese ''agora'', Spanish ''ahora'' "now" < ''hāc hōrā'' "at this hour"; French ''avec'' "with" (prep.) < Old French ''avuec'' (adv.) < ''ab hoc'' "away from that"; Spanish ''tamaño'', Portuguese ''tamanho'' "size" < ''tam magnum'' "so big"; Italian ''codesto'' "this, that" (near you) < Old Italian ''cotevesto'' < ''eccum tibi istum'' approx. "here's that thing of yours"; Portuguese ''você'' "you"<ref>Originally formal, now equalizing or informal.</ref> < ''vosmecê'' < ''vossemecê'' < Old Portuguese ''vossa mercee'' "your mercy".<ref>Likewise Spanish ''usted'' < ''vuestra merced'', Catalan ''vostè'' < ''vostra mercè''.</ref>  A number of common Latin words that have disappeared in many or most Romance languages have survived either in the periphery or in remote corners (especially Sardinia and Romania). For example, Latin ''caseum'' "cheese" in the more outer places (Portuguese ''queijo'', Spanish ''queso'', Romansh ''caschiel'', Sardinian ''càsu'', Romanian ''caş''), but in the central areas has been replaced by ''formāticum'', originally "moulded (cheese)" (French ''fromage'', Occitan/Catalan ''formatge'', Italian ''formaggio''); similarly ''(com)edere'' "to eat (up)", which survives as Spanish/Portuguese ''comer'' but elsewhere is replaced by ''mandūcāre'', originally "to chew" (French ''manger'', Italian ''mangiare''). In some cases, one language happens to preserve a word displaced elsewhere, e.g. Italian ''ogni'' "everything" < ''omnes'', displaced elsewhere by ''tōtum'', originally "whole"; Friulian ''vaî'' "to cry" < ''flere'' "to weep"; [[Vegliote]] ''otijemna'' "fishing pole" < ''antenna'' "yardarm". Sardinian in particular preserves many words entirely lost elsewhere, e.g. ''emmo'' "yes" < ''immo'' "rather/yes/no", ''mannu'' "big" < ''magnus'',<ref>''magnum'' also survives in Spanish ''tamaño'', Portuguese ''tamanho'' "size" < ''tam magnum'' "so big".</ref> ''narare'' "to say" < ''narrāre'' "to tell", and ''domo'' "house" < ([[ablative case|abl.]]) ''domō'' "at home". Sardinian even preserves some words that were already archaic in Classical Latin, e.g. ''àchina'' "grape" < ''acinam''.  ====Latinisms==== During the Middle Ages, scores of words were borrowed directly from Classical Latin (so-called [[Latinism]]s), either in their original form (''learned loans'') or in a somewhat nativized form (''semi-learned loans''). These resulted in many [[doublet (linguistics)|doublets]]—pairs of inherited and learned words—such as those in the table below: {| class="wikitable" |- ! Latin !! Romance !! Inherited !! Latinism |- | ''fragilis'' "fragile" || French || ''frêle'' "frail" || ''fragile'' "fragile" |- | ''fabrica'' "craft, manufacture" || French || ''forge'' "forge" || ''fabrique'' "factory" |- | ''fabrica'' || Spanish || ''fragua'' "forge" || ''fábrica'' "factory" |- | ''fabrica'' || Romanian || ''făură'' "blacksmith (archaic)"|| ''fabrică'' "factory" |- | ''lēgālis'' "legal" || French || ''loyal'' "loyal" || ''légal'' "legal" |- | ''lēgālis'' || Spanish || ''leal'' "loyal" || ''legal'' "legal" |- | ''advōcātus'' "advocate (noun)" || French || ''avoué'' "solicitor (attorney)" || ''avocat'' "barrister (attorney)" |- | ''polīre'' "to polish"  || Portuguese || ''puir'' "to wear thin" || ''polir'' "to polish" |} Sometimes triplets arise:  Latin ''articulus'' "joint" > Portuguese ''artículo'' "joint, knuckle" (learned), ''artigo'' "article" (semi-learned), ''artelho'' "ankle" (inherited; archaic and dialectal). In many cases, the learned word simply displaced the original popular word: e.g. Spanish ''crudo'' "crude, raw" ([[Old Spanish]] ''cruo''); French ''légume'' "vegetable" ([[Old French]]'' leüm'');  Portuguese ''flor'' "flower" ([[Old Portuguese]] ''chor''). The learned loan always looks more like the original than the inherited word does, because regular [[sound change]] has been bypassed; likewise, it usually has a meaning closer to the original.  Borrowing from Classical Latin has produced a large number of suffix doublets. Examples from Spanish (learned form first): ''-ción'' vs. ''-zon''; ''-cia'' vs. ''-za''; ''-ificar'' vs. ''-iguar''; ''-izar'' vs. ''-ear''; ''-mento'' vs. ''-miento''; ''-tud'' (< nominative ''-tūdō'') vs. ''-dumbre'' (< accusative ''-tūdine''); ''-ículo'' vs. ''-ejo''; etc. Similar examples can be found in all the other Romance languages.  This borrowing also introduced large numbers of classical prefixes in their original form (''dis-'', ''ex-'', ''post-'', ''trans''-) and reinforced many others (''re-'', popular Spanish/Portuguese ''des-'' < ''dis-'', popular French ''dé-'' < ''dis-'', popular Italian ''s-'' < ''ex-''). Many Greek prefixes and suffixes ([[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|hellenisms]]) also found their way into the lexicon: ''tele-'', ''poli-/poly-'', ''meta-'', ''pseudo-'', ''-scope/scopo'', ''-logie/logia/logía'', etc.  ==Sound changes== {{IPA notice}} {{See also|Vulgar Latin}}  ===Consonants=== Significant [[sound change]]s affected the consonants of the Romance languages.  ====Apocope==== There was a tendency to eliminate final consonants in Vulgar Latin, either by dropping them ([[apocope]]) or adding a vowel after them ([[epenthesis]]).  Many final consonants were rare, occurring only in certain prepositions (e.g. ''ad'' "towards", ''apud'' "at, near (a person)"), conjunctions (''sed'' "but"), demonstratives (e.g. ''illud'' "that (over there)", ''hoc'' "this"), and nominative singular noun forms, especially of neuter nouns (e.g. ''lac'' "milk", ''mel'' "honey", ''cor'' "heart"). Many of these prepositions and conjunctions were replaced by others, while the nouns were regularized into forms that avoided the final consonants (e.g. *''lacte'', *''mele'', *''core'').  Final ''-m'' was dropped in Vulgar Latin. Even in [[Classical Latin]], final ''-am'', ''-um'' ([[accusative case|accusative]] [[Word ending|endings]]) was often [[elision|elided]] in [[meter (poetry)|poetic meter]], suggesting the ''m'' was weakly pronounced, probably marking the [[nasal vowel|nasalisation]] of the vowel before it. This nasal vowel lost its nasalization in the Romance languages except in monosyllables, where it became /n/ (cf. Spanish ''quien'' < ''quem'', French ''rien'' < ''rem'').  As a result, only the following final consonants occurred in Vulgar Latin: * Final ''-t'' in third-person singular verb forms, and ''-nt'' (often reduced to ''-n'') in third-person plural verb forms. * Final ''-s'' in a large number of morphological endings (verb endings ''-ās/-ēs/-īs/-is'', ''-mus'', ''-tis''; nominative singular ''-us/-is''; plural ''-ās/-ōs/-ēs'') and certain other words (''trēs'' "three", ''crās'' "tomorrow", etc.). * Final ''-n'' in some monosyllables (from earlier ''-m''), and where ''-nt'' reduced to ''-n''. * Final ''-r'', ''-d'' in some prepositions (e.g. ''ad'', ''per''), which were [[proclitic]] forms that attached phonologically to the following word. * Very occasionally, final ''-c'', e.g. [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''oc'' "yes" < ''hoc'' (possibly protected by a final epenthetic vowel at one point).  Final ''-t'' was eventually dropped in many languages, although this often occurred several centuries after the Vulgar Latin period. For example, the reflex of ''-t'' was dropped in [[Old French]] and [[Old Spanish]] only around AD 1100. In Old French, this occurred only when a vowel still preceded the consonant. Hence ''venit'' "he comes" > Old French ''vient'', and the /t/ was never dropped. (It survives to this day in [[liaison (French)|liaison]] forms, e.g. ''vient-il?'' "is he coming?" {{IPA|/vjɛ̃ti(l)/}}.)  In Italo-Romance and [[Eastern Romance]], eventually ''all'' final consonants were either dropped or protected by an epenthetic vowel, except in clitic forms (e.g. prepositions ''con'', ''per''). Modern Italian still has almost no consonant-final words, although Romanian has resurfaced them through later loss of final /u/. For example, ''amās'' "you love" > ''ame'' > ''ami''; ''amant'' "they love" > *''aman'' > ''amano''. On the evidence of "sloppily written" [[Langobardic]] documents, however, the loss of final /s/ did not occur until the seventh or eighth century AD, after the Vulgar Latin period, and the presence of many former final consonants is betrayed by the [[syntactic gemination]] (''raddoppiamento sintattico'') that they trigger. It is also thought that /s/ became /j/ rather than simply disappearing: ''nōs'' > ''noi'' "we", ''s(ed)ēs'' > ''sei'' "you are", ''crās'' > ''crai'' "tomorrow" (southern Italian). In unstressed syllables, the resulting diphthongs were simplified: ''amīcās'' > /aˈmikai/ > ''amiche'' /aˈmike/ "(female) friends", where nominative ''amīcae'' should produce ''**amice'' rather than ''amiche'' (masculine ''amīcī'' > ''amici'' not ''**amichi'').  Central [[Western Romance]] languages eventually regained a large number of final consonants through the general loss of final /e/ and /o/, e.g. Catalan ''llet'' "milk" < ''lactem'', ''foc'' "fire" < ''focum'', ''peix'' "fish" < ''piscem''. In French, most of these secondary final consonants were lost, but tertiary final consonants later arose through the loss of /ə/ < ''-a''. Hence masculine ''frigidum'' "cold" > Old French /froit/ > ''froid'' {{IPA|/fʁwa/}}, feminine ''frigidam'' > Old French /froidə/ > ''froide'' {{IPA|/fʁwad/}}.  ====Palatalization==== {{for2|a table of examples of palatalized n and l in the Romance languages|[[Palatal consonant#Mouillé|Palatal consonant § Mouillé]]}} [[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] was one of the most important processes affecting consonants in Vulgar Latin. This eventually resulted in a whole series of "{{lcons|palatal}}" and {{lcons|postalveolar}} consonants in most Romance languages, e.g. Italian {{IPA|/ʃ/, /ʒ/, /tʃ/, /dʒ/, /ts/, /dz/, /ɲ/, /ʎ/}}.  The following historical stages occurred:  {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" |- ! Stage !! Environment !! Consonants affected !! Result !! Languages affected |- | 1 || rowspan=2|before /j/ (from ''-e,i-'' in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]) || /t/, /d/ || /tsʲ/, /jj~dzʲ~ddʒʲ/ || all |- | 2 || all remaining, except [[labial consonant]]s || /ttʃʲ~ttsʲ/ < ''-ky-'', /jj~ddʒʲ/ < ''-gy-'', /ɲɲ/, /ʎʎ/, /Cʲ/ || all except [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] |- | 3 || before /i/ || rowspan=3|/k/, /g/ || rowspan=2|/tʃʲ~tsʲ/, /j~dʒʲ/ || all except Sardinian |- | 4 || before /e/ || all except Sardinian and [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] |- | 5 || before /a/ || /tɕ~tʃʲ/, /dʑ~dʒʲ/ || north-central [[Gallo-Romance]] (e.g. [[French language|French]], northern [[Occitan language|Occitan]]); [[Rhaeto-Romance]] |}  Note how the environments become progressively less "palatal", and the languages affected become progressively fewer.  The outcomes of palatalization depended on the historical stage, the consonants involved, and the languages involved. The primary division is between the [[Western Romance languages]], with /ts/ resulting from palatalization of /k/, and the remaining languages (Italo-Romance and [[Eastern Romance]]) with /tʃ/ resulting. It is often suggested that /tʃ/ was the original result in all languages, with /tʃ/ > /ts/ a later innovation in the Western Romance languages. Evidence of this is the fact that Italian has both /ttʃ/ and /tts/ as outcomes of palatalization in different environments, while Western Romance has only /(t)ts/. Even more suggestive is the fact that [[Mozarabic]], in southern Spain, had /tʃ/ as the outcome despite being in the "Western Romance" area and geographically disconnected from the remaining /tʃ/ areas; this suggests that Mozarabic was an outlying "relic" area where the change /tʃ/ > /ts/ failed to reach. (Northern French dialects, such as [[Norman language|Norman]] and [[Picard language|Picard]], also had /tʃ/, but this may be a secondary development, i.e. due to a later sound change /ts/ > /tʃ/.) Note that /ts,dz,dʒ/ eventually became /s,z,ʒ/ in most Western Romance languages. Thus Latin ''caelum'' (sky, heaven), pronounced {{IPA|[ˈkailu(m)]}} with an initial {{IPA|[k]}}, became Italian ''cielo'' {{IPA|[ˈtʃɛlo]}}, Romanian ''cer'' {{IPA|[tʃer]}}, Spanish ''cielo'' {{IPA|[ˈθjelo]}}/{{IPA|[ˈsjelo]}}, French ''ciel'' {{IPA|[sjɛl]}}, Catalan ''cel'' {{IPA|[ˈsɛɫ]}}, and Portuguese ''céu'' {{IPA|[ˈsɛw]}}.  The outcome of palatalized /d/ and /g/ is less clear: * Original /j/ has the same outcome as palatalized /g/ everywhere. * Romanian fairly consistently has /z/ < /dz/ from palatalized /d/, but /dʒ/ from palatalized /g/. * Italian inconsistently has {{IPA|/ddz~ddʒ/}} from palatalized /d/, and {{IPA|/ddʒ/}} from palatalized /g/. * Most other languages have the same results for palatalized /d/ and /g/: consistent {{IPA|/dʒ/}} initially, but either /j/ or {{IPA|/dʒ/}} medially (depending on language and exact context). But [[Spanish language|Spanish]] has /j/ initially except before /o/, /u/; nearby [[Gascon language|Gascon]] is similar.  This suggests that palatalized /d/ > /dʲ/ > either /j/ or /dz/ depending on location, while palatalized /g/ > /j/; after this, /j/ > /(d)dʒ/ in most areas, but Spanish and Gascon (originating from isolated districts behind the western [[Pyrenees]]) were relic areas unaffected by this change.  In French, the outcomes of /k/ palatalized by /e,i,j/ and by /a/ were different: ''centum'' "hundred" > ''cent'' {{IPA|/sɑ̃/}} but ''cantum'' "song" > ''chant'' {{IPA|/ʃɑ̃/}}.  The original outcomes of palatalization must have continued to be phonetically palatalized even after they had developed into {{lcons|alveolar}}/{{lcons|postalveolar}}/etc. consonants. This is clear from French, where all originally palatalized consonants triggered the development of a following glide /j/ in certain circumstances (most visible in the endings ''-āre'', ''-ātum/ātam''). In some cases this /j/ came from a consonant palatalized by an adjoining consonant after the late loss of a separating vowel. For example, ''mansiōnātam'' > {{IPA|/masʲoˈnata/}} > {{IPA|masʲˈnada/}} > {{IPA|/masʲˈnʲæðə/}} > early [[Old French]] ''maisnieḍe'' {{IPA|/maisˈniɛðə/}} "household". Similarly, ''mediētātem'' > {{IPA|/mejeˈtate/}} > {{IPA|/mejˈtade/}} > {{IPA|/mejˈtæðe/}} > early [[Old French]] ''meitieḍ'' {{IPA|/mejˈtʲɛθ/}} > modern French ''moitié'' {{IPA|/mwaˈtje/}} "half". In both cases, phonetic palatalization must have remained in primitive Old French at least through the time when unstressed [[intertonic]] vowels were lost (c. eighth century AD?), well after the fragmentation of the Romance languages.  The effect of palatalization is indicated in the writing systems of almost all Romance languages, where the letters {{angbr|c g}} have the "hard" pronunciation {{IPA|[k ɡ]}} in most situations, but a "soft" pronunciation (e.g. French/Portuguese {{IPA|[s ʒ]}}, Italian/Romanian {{IPA|[tʃ dʒ]}}) before {{angbr|e i y}}. (Because [[Middle English]] was originally written by scribes speaking [[Norman French]], the English spelling system has the same peculiarity.) This has the effect of keeping the modern spelling similar to the original Latin spelling, but complicates the relationship between sound and letter. In particular, the hard sounds must be written differently before {{angbr|e i y}} (e.g. Italian {{angbr|ch gh}}, Portuguese {{angbr|qu gu}}), and likewise for the soft sounds when not before these letters (e.g. Italian {{angbr|ci gi}}, Portuguese {{angbr|ç j}}). Furthermore, in Spanish, Catalan, Occitan and Brazilian Portuguese, the use of {{angbr|u}} to signal the hard pronunciation before {{angbr|e i y}} means that a different spelling is also needed to signal the sounds {{IPA|/kw ɡw/}} before these letters (Spanish {{angbr|cu gü}}, Catalan, Occitan and Brazilian Portuguese {{angbr|qü gü}}).<ref>Notice the current Portuguese spelling ([[Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990]]) abolished the use of the diaeresis for this purpose.</ref> This produces a number of orthographic alternations in verbs whose pronunciation is entirely regular. The following are examples of corresponding first-person plural indicative and subjunctive in a number of regular Portuguese verbs: ''marcamos marquemos'' "we mark"; ''caçamos cacemos'' "we hunt"; ''chegamos cheguemos'' "we arrive"; ''averiguamos averigüemos'' "we verify"; ''adequamos adeqüemos'' "we adapt"; ''oferecemos ofereçamos'' "we offer"; ''dirigimos dirijamos'' "we drive" ''erguemos ergamos'' "we raise"; ''delinquimos delincamos'' "we commit a crime".  ====Lenition==== [[Stop consonant]]s shifted by [[lenition]] in Vulgar Latin.  The voiced [[labial consonant]]s {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} (represented by {{angbr|b}} and {{angbr|v}}, respectively) both developed a [[Voiced bilabial fricative|fricative]] {{IPA|[β]}} as an intervocalic allophone.<ref>Pope (1934).</ref> This is clear from the orthography; in medieval times, the spelling of a consonantal {{angbr|v}} is often used for what had been a {{angbr|b}} in Classical Latin, or the two spellings were used interchangeably. In many Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Romanian, etc.), this fricative later developed into a {{IPA|/v/}}; but in others (Spanish, Galician, some Catalan and Occitan dialects, etc.) reflexes of {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} simply merged into a single phoneme.  Several other consonants were "softened" in intervocalic position in Western Romance (Spanish, Portuguese, French, Northern Italian), but normally not phonemically in the rest of Italy (except some cases of "elegant" or Ecclesiastical words), nor apparently at all in Romanian. The dividing line between the two sets of dialects is called the [[La Spezia–Rimini Line]] and is one of the most important [[isogloss]]es of the Romance dialects. The changes (instances of diachronic lenition) are as follows:  Single voiceless plosives became [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]: ''-p-, -t-, -c-'' > ''-b-, -d-, -g-''. Subsequently, in some languages they were further weakened, either becoming [[fricative]]s or [[approximant consonant|approximants]], {{IPA|[β̞], [ð̞], [ɣ˕]}} (as in Spanish) or disappearing entirely (as {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}, but not {{IPA|/p/}}, in French). The following example shows progressive weakening of original /t/: e.g. ''vītam'' > Italian ''vita'' {{IPA|[ˈvita]}}, Portuguese ''vida'' {{IPA|[ˈvidɐ]}} (European Portuguese {{IPA|[ˈviðɐ]}}), Spanish ''vida'' {{IPA|[ˈbiða]}} (Southern Peninsular Spanish {{IPA|[ˈbia]}}), and French ''vie'' {{IPA|[vi]}}. These sound changes may be due in part to the influence of [[Continental Celtic languages]]. * The voiced plosives {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} tended to disappear. * The plain [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]] ''-s-'' {{IPA|[s]}} was also voiced to {{IPA|[z]}} between vowels, although in many languages its spelling has not changed. (In Spanish, intervocalic {{IPA|[z]}} was later devoiced back to {{IPA|[s]}}; {{IPA|[z]}} is only found as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/s/}} before voiced consonants in Modern Spanish.) * The [[geminate consonant|double]] plosives became single: ''-pp-, -tt-, -cc-, -bb-, -dd-, -gg-'' > ''-p-, -t-, -c-, -b-, -d-, -g-'' in most languages. In French spelling, double consonants are merely etymological, except for -ll- after -i (pronounced [ij]), in most cases. * The double sibilant ''-ss-'' {{IPA|[sː]}} also became phonetically single {{IPA|[s]}}, although in many languages its spelling has not changed.  [[geminate consonant|Consonant length]] is no longer phonemically distinctive in most Romance languages. However some [[languages of Italy]] (Italian, [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], Sicilian, and numerous other varieties of central and southern Italy) do have long consonants like {{IPA|/ɡɡ/, /dd/, /bb/}}, {{IPA|/kk/, /tt/, /pp/, /ll/, /mm/, /nn/, /ss/,}} and to a lesser extent {{IPA|/rr/,}} etc., where the doubling indicates a short hold before the consonant is released, in many cases with distinctive lexical value: e.g. ''note'' {{IPA|/ˈnɔ.te/}} (notes) vs. ''notte'' {{IPA|/ˈnɔt.te/}} (night), ''cade'' {{IPA|/ˈka.de/}} (s/he, it falls) vs. ''cadde'' {{IPA|/ˈkad.de/}} (s/he, it fell). They may even occur at the beginning of words in [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]], Neapolitan and Sicilian, and are occasionally indicated in writing, e.g. Sicilian ''cchiù'' (more), and ''ccà'' (here). In general, the consonants {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, and {{IPA|/dz/}} are long at the start of a word, while the [[archiphoneme]] {{IPA|<nowiki>|R|</nowiki>}} is realised as a [[Trill consonant|trill]] {{IPA|/r/}} in the same position.  A few languages have regained secondary geminate consonants. The double consonants of [[Piedmontese]] exist only after stressed {{IPA|/ə/}}, written ''ë'', and are not etymological: ''vëdde'' (Latin ''vidēre'', to see), ''sëcca'' (Latin ''sicca'', dry, feminine of ''sech''). In standard Catalan and Occitan, there exists a geminate sound {{IPA|/lː/}} written ''ŀl'' (Catalan) or ''ll'' (Occitan), but it is usually pronounced as a simple sound in colloquial (and even some formal) speech in both languages.  ====Prosthesis==== In [[Western Romance]], an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] or [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] vowel was inserted at the beginning of any word that began with {{IPA|/s/}} and another consonant: ''spatha'' "sword" > Spanish/Portuguese ''espada'', Catalan ''espasa'', Old French ''espeḍe'' > modern  ''épée''; ''Stephanum'' "Stephen" > Spanish ''Esteban'', Catalan ''Esteve'', Portuguese ''Estêvão'', Old French ''Estievne'' > modern ''Étienne''; ''status'' "state" > Spanish/Portuguese ''estado'', Catalan ''estat'', Old French ''estat'' > modern ''état''; ''spiritus'' "spirit" > Spanish ''espíritu'', Portuguese ''espírito'', Catalan ''esperit'', French ''esprit''. Epenthetic /e/ in Western Romance languages was also probably influenced by Continental Celtic languages. While Western Romance words undergo word-initial epenthesis, cognates in Italian do not: ''spatha'' > ''spada'', ''Stephanum'' > ''Stefano'', ''status'' > ''stato'', ''spiritus'' > ''spirito''. In Italian, syllabification rules were preserved instead by vowel-final articles, thus feminine ''spada'' as ''la spada'', but instead of rendering the masculine ''*il spaghetto'', ''lo spaghetto'' came to be the norm. Though receding at present, Italian once had an epenthetic {{IPA|/i/}} if a consonant preceded such clusters, so that 'in Switzerland' was ''in'' {{IPA|/i/}}''Svizzera''. Some speakers still use the prosthetic {{IPA|/i/}}, and it is fossilized in a few set phrases as ''per iscritto'' 'in writing' (although in this case it has probably survived due to the influence of the separate word ''iscritto'' < Latin ''īnscrīptus'').  ===Stressed vowels===  ====Loss of vowel length, reorientation==== {| class="wikitable" cellspacing="1" style="float:right; margin-left:1em; text-align:center;" |- !colspan="9"| Evolution of the stressed vowels in early Romance |- !colspan="3"| Classical !

Classical Latin had five short vowels, ''ă, ĕ, ĭ, ŏ, ŭ'', and five [[vowel length|long vowels]], ''ā, ē, ī, ō, ū'', each of which was an individual [[phoneme]] (see the table in the right, for their likely pronunciation in IPA), and four [[diphthong]]s, ''ae'', ''oe'', ''au'' and ''eu'' (five according to some authors, including ''ui''). There were also long and short versions of ''y'', representing the [[Close front rounded vowel|rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/y(ː)/}} in Greek borrowings, which however probably came to be pronounced {{IPA|/i(ː)/}} even before Romance vowel changes started.  There is evidence that in the imperial period all the short vowels except ''a'' differed by quality as well as by length from their long counterparts.<ref>Allen (2003) states: "There appears to have been no great difference in quality between long and short ''a'', but in the case of the close and mid vowels (''i'' and ''u'', ''e'' and ''o'') the long appear to have been appreciably closer than the short." He then goes on to the historical development, quotations from various authors (from around the second century AD), as well as evidence from older inscriptions where "e" stands for normally short ''i'', and "i" for long ''e'', etc.</ref> So, for example ''ē'' was pronounced [[Close-mid vowel|close-mid]] {{IPA|/eː/}} while ''ĕ'' was pronounced [[Open-mid vowel|open-mid]] {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and ''ī'' was pronounced [[Close vowel|close]] {{IPA|/iː/}} while ''ĭ'' was pronounced [[Near-close vowel|near-close]] {{IPA|/ɪ/}}.  During the Proto-Romance period, phonemic length distinctions were lost. Vowels came to be automatically pronounced long in stressed, [[open syllable]]s (i.e. when followed by only one consonant), and pronounced short everywhere else. This situation is still maintained in modern Italian: ''cade'' {{IPA|[ˈkaːde]}} "he falls" vs. ''cadde'' {{IPA|[ˈkadde]}} "he fell".  The Proto-Romance loss of phonemic length originally produced a system with nine different quality distinctions in monophthongs, where only original {{IPA|/ă ā/}} had merged. Soon, however, many of these vowels coalesced: * The simplest outcome was in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]],<ref>Technically, Sardinian is one of the [[Southern Romance languages]]. The same vowel outcome occurred in a small strip running across southern Italy (the ''Lausberg Zone''), and is thought to have formerly occurred in the Romance languages of northern Africa.</ref> where the former long and short vowels in Latin simply coalesced, e.g. {{IPA|/ĕ ē/}} > {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ĭ ī/}} > {{IPA|/i/}}: This produced a simple five-vowel system {{IPA|/a e i o u/}}. * In most areas, however (technically, the [[Italo-Western languages]]), the near-close vowels {{IPA|/ɪ ʊ/}} lowered and merged into the high-mid vowels {{IPA|/e o/}}. As a result, Latin ''pira'' "pear" and ''vēra'' "true", came to rhyme (e.g. Italian and Spanish ''pera, vera'', and [[Old French]] ''poire, voire''). Similarly, Latin ''nucem'' (from ''nux'' "nut") and ''vōcem'' (from ''vōx'' "voice") become Italian ''noce, voce'', Portuguese ''noz, voz'', and French ''noix, voix''. This produced a seven-vowel system {{IPA|/a ɛ e i ɔ o u/}}, still maintained in conservative languages such as Italian and Portuguese, and lightly transformed in Spanish (where {{IPA|/ɛ/ > /je/, /ɔ/ > /we/}}). * In the [[Eastern Romance languages]] (particularly, [[Romanian language|Romanian]]), the front vowels {{IPA|/ĕ ē ĭ ī/}} evolved as in the majority of languages, but the back vowels {{IPA|/ŏ ō ŭ ū/}} evolved as in Sardinian. This produced an unbalanced six-vowel system: {{IPA|/a ɛ e i o u/}}. In modern Romanian, this system has been significantly transformed, with {{IPA|/ɛ/ > /je/}} and with new vowels {{IPA|/ə ɨ/}} evolving, leading to a balanced seven-vowel system with central as well as front and back vowels: {{IPA|/a e i ə ɨ o u/}}. * [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] is sometimes described as having its own distinct vowel system. In fact, Sicilian passed through the same developments as the main bulk of Italo-Western languages. Subsequently, however, high-mid vowels (but not low-mid vowels) were raised in all syllables, stressed and unstressed; i.e. {{IPA|/e o/ > /i u/}}. The result is a five-vowel {{IPA|/a ɛ i ɔ u/}}.  The Proto-Romance allophonic vowel-length system was rephonemicized in the [[Gallo-Romance languages]] as a result of the loss of many final vowels. Some northern Italian languages (e.g. [[Friulan language|Friulan]]) still maintain this secondary phonemic length, but most languages dropped it by either diphthongizing or shortening the new long vowels.  French phonemicized a third vowel length system around AD 1300 as a result of the sound change /VsC/ > /VhC/ > {{IPA|/VːC/}} (where ''V'' is any vowel and ''C'' any consonant). This vowel length was eventually lost by around AD 1700, but the former long vowels are still marked with a circumflex. A fourth vowel length system, still non-phonemic, has now arisen: All nasal vowels as well as the oral vowels {{IPA|/ɑ o ø/}} (which mostly derive from former long vowels) are pronounced long in all stressed [[closed syllable]]s, and all vowels are pronounced long in syllables closed by the voiced fricatives {{IPA|/v z ʒ ʁ vʁ/}}. This system in turn has been phonemicized in some non-standard dialects (e.g. [[Haitian Creole]]), as a result of the loss of final {{IPA|/ʁ/}}.  ====Latin diphthongs==== The Latin diphthongs ''ae'' and ''oe'', pronounced {{IPA|/ai/}} and {{IPA|/oi/}} in earlier Latin, were early on monophthongized.  ''ae'' became {{IPA|/ɛː/}} by the {{smallcaps|a.d.}} 1st century at the latest. Although this sound was still distinct from all existing vowels, the neutralization of Latin vowel length eventually caused its merger with {{IPA|/ɛ/}} < short ''e'': e.g. ''caelum'' "sky" > French ''ciel'', Spanish/Italian ''cielo'', Portuguese ''céu'' {{IPA|/sɛw/}}, with the same vowel as in ''mele'' "honey" > French/Spanish ''miel'', Italian ''miele'', Portuguese ''mel'' {{IPA|/mɛl/}}. Some words show an early merger of ''ae'' with {{IPA|/eː/}}, as in ''praeda'' "booty" > Gallo-Romance {{IPA|/preːða/}} > Old French ''preie'' (vs. expected **''priée'') > French ''proie'' "prey"; or ''faenum'' "hay" > ''fēnum'' [{{IPA|feːnu}}] > Spanish ''heno'', French ''foin''.  ''oe'' generally merged with {{IPA|/eː/}}: ''poenam'' "punishment" > Romance *{{IPA|/péna/}} > Spanish/Italian ''pena'', French ''peine''; ''foedus'' "ugly" > Romance *{{IPA|/fédo/}} > Spanish ''feo'', Portuguese ''feio''. There are relatively few such outcomes, since ''oe'' was rare in Classical Latin (most original instances had become Classical ''ū'', as in Old Latin ''oinos'' "one" > Classical ''ūnus''<ref name="Palmer">Palmer (1954).</ref>).  ''au'' merged with ''ō'' [{{IPA|o}}] in the popular speech of Rome already by the 1st century {{smallcaps|b.c}}. A number of authors remarked on this explicitly, e.g. [[Cicero]]'s taunt that the populist politician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] had changed his name from ''Claudius'' to ingratiate himself with the masses. This change never penetrated far from Rome, however, and the pronunciation /au/ was maintained for centuries in the vast majority of Latin-speaking areas, although it eventually developed into some variety of ''o'' in many languages. For example, Italian and French have {{IPA|/ɔ/}} as the usual reflex, but this post-dates diphthongization of {{IPA|ɔ}} and the French-specific palatalization {{IPA|/ka/}} > {{IPA|/tʃa/}} (hence ''causa'' > French ''chose'', Italian ''cosa'' {{IPA|/kɔza/}} not *''cuosa''). Spanish has /o/, but Portuguese spelling maintains {{angbr|ou}}, only recently developed to {{IPA|/o/}} (and still /ou/ in some dialects). Occitan, Romanian, southern Italian languages, and many other minority Romance languages still have /au/. A few common words, however, show an early merger with ''ō'' [{{IPA|o}}], evidently reflecting a generalization of the popular Roman pronunciation: e.g. French ''queue'', Italian ''coda'' {{IPA|/koda/}}, Occitan ''co(d)a'', Romanian ''coadă'' (all meaning "tail") must all derive from ''cōda'' rather than Classical ''cauda''.<ref>''cauda'' would produce French **''choue'', Italian {{IPA|*[kɔda]}}, Occitan **''cauda'', Romanian **''caudă''.</ref> Similarly, Portuguese ''orelha'', French ''oreille'', Romanian ''ureche'', and Sardinian ''olícra'', ''orícla'' "ear" must derive from ''oricla'' rather than Classical ''auris'', and the form ''oricla'' is in fact reflected in the [[Appendix Probi]] (but Occitan ''aurelha'' reflects ''auricla'', probably influenced by ''ausir'' "to hear").  ====Further developments====  =====Metaphony===== {{Main|Metaphony (Romance languages)}} An early process that operated in all Romance languages to varying degrees was [[metaphony]] (vowel mutation), conceptually similar to the [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] process so characteristic of the [[Germanic languages]]. Depending on the language, certain stressed vowels were raised (or sometimes diphthongized) either by a final /i/ or /u/ or by a directly following /j/. Metaphony is most extensive in the Italo-Romance languages, and applies to nearly all languages in Italy; however, it is absent from Tuscan, and hence from standard Italian. In many languages affected by metaphony, a distinction exists between final /u/ (from most cases of Latin ''-um'') and final /o/ (from Latin ''-ō'', ''-ud'' and some cases of ''-um'', esp. masculine "mass" nouns), and only the former triggers metaphony.  Some examples: * In [[Servigliano]], in the [[Marches]] of Italy, stressed {{IPA|/ɛ e ɔ o/}} are raised to {{IPA|/e i o u/}} before final /i/ or /u/:<ref name="kaze1991">{{cite journal|last1=Kaze |first1=Jeffery W. |title=Metaphony and Two Models for the Description of Vowel Systems |journal=Phonology |volume=8 |number=1 |year=1991 |pages=163–170 |jstor=4420029 |doi=10.1017/s0952675700001329}}</ref> {{IPA|/ˈmetto/}} "I put" vs. {{IPA|/ˈmitti/}} "you put" (< *metti < *mettes < Latin ''mittis''); {{IPA|/moˈdɛsta/}} "modest (fem.)" vs. {{IPA|/moˈdestu/}} "modest (masc.)"; {{IPA|/ˈkwesto/}} "this (neut.)" (< Latin ''eccum istud'') vs. {{IPA|/ˈkwistu/}} "this (masc.)" (< Latin ''eccum istum''). * [[Calvallo]], in the [[Basilicata]] region of southern Italy, is similar, but the low-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛ ɔ/}} are diphthongized to {{IPA|/je wo/}} rather than raised:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Calabrese |first1=Andrea |url=http://homepages.uconn.edu/~anc02008/Papers/METAPHONY.pdf |title=Metaphony |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref> {{IPA|/ˈmette/}} "he puts" vs. {{IPA|/ˈmitti/}} "you put", but {{IPA|/ˈpɛnʒo/}} "I think" vs. {{IPA|/ˈpjenʒi/}} "you think". * Metaphony also occurs in most northern Italian dialects, but only by (usually lost) final *i; apparently, final *u was lowered to *o (usually lost) before metaphony could take effect. * Some of the [[Astur-Leonese]] dialects, in northern Spain, have the same distinction between final /o/ and /u/<ref>[http://personales.uniovi.es/web/ariasal/ Álvaro Arias.

This has been phonemicized in the [[Campidanese]] dialect as a result of the raising of final /e o/ to /i u/. * Raising of {{IPA|/ɔ/}} to {{IPA|/o/}} occurs sporadically in Portuguese in the masculine singular, e.g. ''porco'' {{IPA|/ˈporku/}} "pig" vs. ''porcos'' {{IPA|/ˈpɔrkus/}} "pig".  It is thought that [[Old Portuguese]] at one point had singular /u/ vs. plural /os/, exactly as in modern [[Astur-Leonese]].<ref name="penny1994"/> * In all of the [[Western Romance]] languages, final /i/ (primarily occurring in the first-person singular of the [[preterite]]) raised mid-high {{IPA|/e o/}} to {{IPA|/i u/}}, e.g. Portuguese ''fiz'' "I did" (< *fidzi < *fedzi < Latin ''fēcī'') vs. ''fez'' "he did" (< *fedze < Latin ''fēcit''). [[Old Spanish]] similarly had ''fize'' "I did" vs. ''fezo'' "he did" (''-o'' by analogy with ''amó'' "he loved"), but subsequently generalized stressed /i/, producing modern ''hice'' "I did" vs. ''hizo'' "he did". The same thing happened prehistorically in [[Old French]], yielding ''fis'' "I did", ''fist'' "he did" (< *feist < Latin ''fēcit'').  =====Diphthongization===== A number of languages [[diphthongization|diphthongized]] some of the free vowels, especially the low-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛ ɔ/}}: * Spanish consistently diphthongized all low-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛ ɔ/ > /je we/}} except for before certain palatal consonants (which raised the vowels to high-mid before diphthongization took place). * Romanian similarly diphthongized {{IPA|/ɛ/}} to {{IPA|/je/}} (the corresponding vowel {{IPA|/ɔ/}} did not develop from Proto-Romance). * Italian diphthongized {{IPA|/ɛ/ > /jɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/ > /wɔ/}} in open syllables (in the situations where vowels were lengthened in Proto-Romance). * French similarly diphthongized {{IPA|/ɛ ɔ/}} in open syllables (when lengthened), along with {{IPA|/a e o/}}: {{IPA|/aː ɛː eː ɔː oː/}} > {{IPA|/aɛ iɛ ei uɔ ou/}} > middle OF {{IPA|/e je ɔi we eu/}} > modern {{IPA|/e je wa œ ~ ø œ ~ ø/}}. * French also diphthongized {{IPA|/ɛ ɔ/}} before palatalized consonants, especially /j/. Further development was as follows: {{IPA|/ɛj/ > /iej/ > /i/}}; {{IPA|/ɔj/}} > /uoj/ > early OF /uj/ > modern /ɥi/. * Catalan diphthongized {{IPA|/ɛ ɔ/}} before /j/ from palatalized consonants, just like French, with similar results: {{IPA|/ɛj/ > /i/}}, {{IPA|/ɔj/ > /uj/}}.  These diphthongizations had the effect of reducing or eliminating the distinctions between low-mid and high-mid vowels in many languages. In Spanish and Romanian, all low-mid vowels were diphthongized, and the distinction disappeared entirely. Portuguese is the most conservative in this respect, keeping the seven-vowel system more or less unchanged (but with changes in particular circumstances, e.g. due to [[#Metaphony|metaphony]]). Other than before palatalized consonants, Catalan keeps {{IPA|/ɔ o/}} intact, but {{IPA|/ɛ e/}} split in a complex fashion into {{IPA|/ɛ e ə/}} and then coalesced again in the standard dialect ([[Eastern Catalan]]) in such a way that most original {{IPA|/ɛ e/}} have reversed their quality to become {{IPA|/e ɛ/}}.  In French and Italian, the distinction between low-mid and high-mid vowels occurred only in closed syllables. Standard Italian more or less maintains this. In French, /e/ and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} merged by the twelfth century or so, and the distinction between {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} was eliminated without merging by the sound changes {{IPA|/u/ > /y/}}, {{IPA|/o/ > /u/}}. Generally this led to a situation where both {{IPA|[e,o]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ,ɔ]}} occur allophonically, with the high-mid vowels in [[open syllable]]s and the low-mid vowels in [[closed syllable]]s. This is still the situation in modern Spanish, for example. In French, however, both {{IPA|[e/ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[o/ɔ]}} were partly rephonemicized: Both {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} occur in open syllables as a result of {{IPA|/aj/ > /ɛ/}}, and both {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} occur in closed syllables as a result of {{IPA|/al/ > /au/ > /o/}}.  Old French also had numerous falling diphthongs resulting from diphthongization before palatal consonants or from a fronted /j/ originally following palatal consonants in Proto-Romance or later: e.g. ''pācem'' /patsʲe/ "peace" > PWR */padzʲe/ (lenition) > OF ''paiz'' /pajts/; *''punctum'' "point" > Gallo-Romance */ponʲto/ > */pojɲto/ (fronting) > OF ''point'' /põjnt/. During the Old French period, preconsonantal /l/ [ɫ] vocalized to /w/, producing many new falling diphthongs: e.g. ''dulcem'' "sweet" > PWR */doltsʲe/ > OF ''dolz'' /duɫts/ > ''douz'' /duts/; ''fallet'' "fails, is deficient" > OF ''falt'' > ''faut'' "is needed"; ''bellus'' "beautiful" > OF ''bels'' {{IPA|[bɛɫs]}} > ''beaus'' {{IPA|[bɛaws]}}. By the end of the Middle French period, ''all'' falling diphthongs either monophthongized or switched to rising diphthongs: proto OF {{IPA|/aj ɛj jɛj ej jej wɔj oj uj al ɛl el il ɔl ol ul/}} > early OF {{IPA|/aj ɛj i ej yj oj yj aw ɛaw ew i ɔw ow y/}} > modern spelling {{angbr|ai ei i oi ui oi ui au eau eu i ou ou u}} > mod. French {{IPA|/ɛ ɛ i wa ɥi wa ɥi o o ø i u u y/}}.  =====Nasalization===== In both French and Portuguese, [[nasal vowels]] eventually developed from sequences of a vowel followed by a nasal consonant (/m/ or /n/). Originally, all vowels in both languages were nasalized before any nasal consonants, and nasal consonants not immediately followed by a vowel were eventually dropped. In French, nasal vowels before remaining nasal consonants were subsequently denasalized, but not before causing the vowels to lower somewhat, e.g. ''dōnat'' "he gives" > OF ''dune'' {{IPA|/dunə/}} > ''donne'' {{IPA|/dɔn/}}, ''fēminam'' > ''femme'' {{IPA|/fam/}}. Other vowels remained diphthongized, and were dramatically lowered: ''fīnem'' "end" > ''fin'' {{IPA|/fɛ̃/}} (often pronounced {{IPA|[fæ̃]}}); ''linguam'' "tongue" > ''langue'' {{IPA|/lɑ̃ɡ/}}; ''ūnum'' "one" > ''un'' {{IPA|/œ̃/, /ɛ̃/}}.  In Portuguese, /n/ between vowels was dropped, and the resulting [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] eliminated through vowel contraction of various sorts, often producing diphthongs: ''manum, *manōs'' > PWR *''manu, ˈmanos'' "hand(s)" > ''mão, mãos'' {{IPA|/mɐ̃w̃, mɐ̃w̃s/}}; ''canem, canēs'' "dog(s)" > PWR *''kane, ˈkanes'' > *''can, ˈcanes'' > ''cão, cães'' {{IPA|/kɐ̃w̃, kɐ̃j̃s/}}; ''ratiōnem, ratiōnēs'' "reason(s)" > PWR *''raˈdʲzʲone, raˈdʲzʲones'' > *''raˈdzon, raˈdzones'' > ''razão, razões'' {{IPA|/χaˈzɐ̃w̃, χaˈzõj̃s/}} (Brazil), {{IPA|/ʁaˈzɐ̃ũ, ʁɐˈzõj̃s/}} (Portugal). Sometimes the nasalization was eliminated: ''lūna'' "moon" > [[Old Portuguese]] ''lũa'' > ''lua''; ''vēna'' "vein" > Old Portuguese ''vẽa'' > ''veia''. Nasal vowels that remained actually tend to be raised (rather than lowered, as in French): ''fīnem'' "end" > ''fim'' {{IPA|/fĩ/}}; ''centum'' "hundred" > PWR ''tʲsʲɛnto'' > ''cento'' {{IPA|/ˈsẽtu/}}; ''pontem'' "bridge" > PWR ''pɔnte'' > ''ponte'' {{IPA|/ˈpõtʃi/}} (Brazil), {{IPA|/ˈpõtɨ/}} (Portugal). In Portugal, vowels before a nasal consonant have become denasalized, but in Brazil they remain heavily nasalized.  ====Front-rounded vowels==== Characteristic of the [[Gallo-Romance languages]] and [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]] are the [[front rounded vowel]]s {{IPA|/y ø œ/}}. All of these languages show an unconditional change /u/ > /y/, e.g. ''lūnam'' > French ''lune'' {{IPA|/lyn/}}, Occitan {{IPA|/ˈlyno/}}. Many of the languages in Switzerland and Italy show the further change /y/ > /i/. Also very common is some variation of the French development {{IPA|/ɔː oː/}} (lengthened in [[open syllable]]s) > {{IPA|/we ew/}} > {{IPA|/œ œ/}}, with mid back vowels diphthongizing in some circumstances and then re-monophthongizing into mid-front rounded vowels. (French has both {{IPA|/ø/}} and {{IPA|/œ/}}, with {{IPA|/ø/}} developing from {{IPA|/œ/}} in certain circumstances.)  ===Unstressed vowels=== {| class="wikitable" cellspacing="1" style="float:right; margin:1em; text-align:center;" |+Evolution of unstressed vowels in early Italo-Western Romance !rowspan=3| Latin !rowspan=2| Proto-<br>Romance !colspan="2" rowspan=2| Stressed || rowspan=2|Non-final<br>unstressed || colspan=5|Final-unstressed |- !

Originally in Proto-Romance, the same nine vowels developed in unstressed as stressed syllables, and in Sardinian, they coalesced into the same five vowels in the same way.  In Italo-Western Romance, however, vowels in unstressed syllables were significantly different from stressed vowels, with yet a third outcome for final unstressed syllables. In non-final unstressed syllables, the seven-vowel system of stressed syllables developed, but then the low-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛ ɔ/}} merged into the high-mid vowels {{IPA|/e o/}}. This system is still preserved, largely or completely, in all of the conservative Romance languages (e.g. Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan).  In final unstressed syllables, results were somewhat complex. One of the more difficult issues is the development of final short ''-u'', which appears to have been raised to {{IPA|/u/}} rather than lowered to {{IPA|/o/}}, as happened in all other syllables. However, it is possible that in reality, final {{IPA|/u/}} comes from ''long'' *''-ū'' < ''-um'', where original final ''-m'' caused vowel lengthening as well as nasalization. Evidence of this comes from [[Rhaeto-Romance]], in particular [[Sursilvan]], which preserves reflexes of both final ''-us'' and ''-um'', and where the latter, but not the former, triggers [[#Metaphony|metaphony]]. This suggests the development ''-us'' > {{IPA|/ʊs/}} > {{IPA|/os/}}, but ''-um'' > {{IPA|/ũː/}} > {{IPA|/u/}}.<ref>Note that the outcome of ''-am -em -om'' would be the same regardless of whether lengthening occurred, and that ''-im'' was already rare in Classical Latin, and appears to have barely survived in Proto-Romance. The only likely survival is in "-teen" numerals such as ''trēdecim'' "thirteen" > Italian ''tredici''. This favors the vowel-lengthening hypothesis ''-im'' > {{IPA|/ĩː/}} > {{IPA|/i/}}; but notice unexpected ''decem'' > Italian ''dieci'' (rather than expected ''*diece''). It is possible that ''dieci'' comes from *''decim'', which analogically replaced ''decem'' based on the ''-decim'' ending; but it is also possible that the final /i/ in ''dieci'' represents an irregular development of some other sort and that the process of analogy worked in the other direction.</ref>  {| class="wikitable" cellspacing="1" style="float:right; margin:1em;" |+Examples of evolution of final unstressed vowels:<br>From least- to most-changed languages ! rowspan=2|English !! rowspan=2|Latin !!

Conservative languages like Spanish largely maintain that system, but drop final /e/ after certain single consonants, e.g. /r/, /l/, /n/, /d/, /z/ (< palatalized ''c''). * In the [[Gallo-Romance languages]] (part of Western Romance), final /o/ and /e/ were dropped entirely unless that produced an impossible final cluster (e.g. /tr/), in which case a "prop vowel" /e/ was added. This left only two final vowels: /a/ and prop vowel /e/. Catalan preserves this system. * Loss of final stressless vowels in [[Venetian language|Venetian]] shows a pattern intermediate between Central Italian and the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic]] branch, and the environments for vowel deletion vary considerably depending on the dialect. In table above final /e/ is uniformly absent in ''mar'', absent in some dialects in ''part(e)'' /part(e)/ and ''set(e)'' /sɛt(e)/, but retained in ''mare'' (< Latin ''mātrem'') as a relic of the earlier cluster *dr. * In primitive [[Old French]] (one of the [[Gallo-Romance languages]]), these two remaining vowels merged into {{IPA|/ə/}}.  Various later changes happened in individual languages, e.g.: * In French, most final consonants were dropped, and then final {{IPA|/ə/}} was also dropped. The {{IPA|/ə/}} is still preserved in spelling as a final silent ''-e'', whose main purpose is to signal that the previous consonant is pronounced, e.g. ''port'' "port" {{IPA|/pɔʁ/}} vs. ''porte'' "door" {{IPA|/pɔʁt/}}. These changes also eliminated the difference between singular and plural in most words: ''ports'' "ports" (still {{IPA|/pɔʁ/}}), ''portes'' "doors" (still {{IPA|/pɔʁt/}}). Final consonants reappear in [[liaison (French)|liaison]] contexts (in close connection with a following vowel-initial word), e.g. ''nous'' {{IPA|/nu/}} "we" vs. ''nous avons'' {{IPA|/nuz-aˈvɔ̃/}} "we have", ''il fait'' {{IPA|/il fɛ/}} "he does" vs. ''fait-il?" {{IPA|/fɛt-il/}} "does he?". * In Portuguese, final unstressed /o/ and /u/ were apparently preserved intact for a while, since final unstressed /u/, but not /o/ or /os/, triggered [[metaphony]] (see above). Final-syllable unstressed /o/ was raised in preliterary times to /u/, but always still written {{angbr|o}}. At some point (perhaps in late [[Old Portuguese]]), final-syllable unstressed /e/ was raised to /i/ (but still written {{angbr|e}}); this remains in [[Brazilian Portuguese]], but has developed to {{IPA|/ɨ/}} in [[European Portuguese]]. * In Catalan, final unstressed {{IPA|/as/}} > {{IPA|/es/}}. In many dialects, unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} merge into {{IPA|/u/}} as in Portuguese, and unstressed {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} merge into {{IPA|/ə/}}. However, some dialects preserve the original five-vowel system, most notably standard [[Valencian language|Valencian]].  ===Intertonic vowels=== The so-called ''intertonic vowels'' are word-internal unstressed vowels, i.e. not in the initial, final, or ''tonic'' (i.e. stressed) syllable, hence intertonic. Intertonic vowels were the most subject to loss or modification. Already in Vulgar Latin intertonic vowels between a single consonant and a following /r/ or /l/ tended to drop: ''vétulum'' "old" > ''veclum'' > Dalmatian ''vieklo'', Sicilian ''vecchiu'', Portuguese ''velho''. But many languages ultimately dropped almost all intertonic vowels.  Generally, those languages south and east of the [[La Spezia–Rimini Line]] (Romanian and Central-Southern Italian) maintained intertonic vowels, while those to the north and west (Western Romance) dropped all except /a/. Standard Italian generally maintained intertonic vowels, but typically raised unstressed /e/ > /i/. Examples: * ''septimā́nam'' "week" > Italian ''settimana'', Romanian ''săptămână'' vs. Spanish/Portuguese ''semana'', French ''semaine'', Occitan/Catalan ''setmana'', Piedmontese ''sman-a'' * ''quattuórdecim'' "fourteen" > Italian ''quattordici'', Venetian ''cuatòrdexe'', Lombard/Piedmontese ''quatòrdes'', vs. Spanish ''catorce'', Portuguese/French ''quatorze'' * ''metipsissimus''<ref>The Latin forms are attested; ''metipsissimus'' is the superlative of the formative -''metipse'', found for example in ''egometipse'' "myself in person"</ref> > ''medipsimus'' /medíssimos/ ~ /medéssimos/ "self"<ref>Ralph Penny, ''A History of the Spanish Language'', 2nd edn.

Old French ''aidier'' "to help" vs. ''aiue'' "he helps") Portuguese is more conservative in maintaining some intertonic vowels other than /a/: e.g. *''offerḗscere'' "to offer" > Portuguese ''oferecer'' vs. Spanish ''ofrecer'', French ''offrir'' (< *''offerīre''). French, on the other hand, drops even intertonic /a/ after the stress: ''Stéphanum'' "Stephen" > Spanish ''Esteban'' but Old French ''Estievne'' > French ''Étienne''. Many cases of /a/ before the stress also ultimately dropped in French: ''sacraméntum'' "sacrament" > Old French ''sairement'' > French ''serment'' "oath".  ==Writing systems== {{Main|Latin script}} The Romance languages for the most part have kept the writing system of Latin, adapting it to their evolution. One exception was Romanian before the nineteenth century, where, after the Roman retreat, literacy was reintroduced through the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]], a Slavic influence. A Cyrillic alphabet was also used for Romanian (Moldovan) in the [[USSR]]. The non-Christian populations of Spain also used the scripts of their religions ([[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]]) to write Romance languages such as [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] and [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] in ''[[aljamiado]]''.  ===Letters=== {|class="wikitable" style="float: right; text-align: center;" |+Spelling of results of palatalization and related sounds !

In particular, the single Latin letter ''V'' split into ''V'' (consonant) and ''U'' (vowel), and the letter ''I'' split into ''I'' and ''J''. The Latin letter ''K'' and the new letter ''W'', which came to be widely used in Germanic languages, are seldom used in most Romance languages&nbsp;– mostly for unassimilated foreign names and words. Indeed in Italian prose ''*kilometro'' is properly ''chilometro.'' Catalan eschews importation of "foreign" letters more than most languages. Thus Wikipedia becomes ''Viquipèdia'' in Catalan but remains ''Wikipedia'' in Spanish.  While most of the 23 basic Latin letters have maintained their phonetic value, for some of them it has diverged considerably; and the new letters added since the Middle Ages have been put to different uses in different scripts. Some letters, notably ''H'' and ''Q'', have been variously combined in [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] or [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]] (see below) to represent phonetic phenomena that could not be recorded with the basic Latin alphabet, or to get around previously established spelling conventions. Most languages added auxiliary marks ([[diacritics]]) to some letters, for these and other purposes.  The spelling rules of most Romance languages are fairly simple, but subject to considerable regional variation. The letters with most conspicuous phonetic variations, between Romance languages or with respect to Latin, are:  :'''B, V''': Merged in Spanish and most dialects of Catalan, where both letters are pronounced as either {{IPA|[b]}} or {{IPA|[β]}} (similar to ''v'') depending on position, with no relationship between sound and spelling. :'''C''': Generally a "hard" {{IPA|[k]}}, but "soft" ([[fricative consonant|fricative]] or [[affricate consonant|affricate]]) before ''e'', ''i'', or ''y''. :'''G''': Generally a "hard" {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, but "soft" (fricative or affricate) before ''e'', ''i'', or ''y''. In some languages, like Spanish, the hard ''g'' is pronounced as a fricative {{IPA|[ɣ]}} after vowels. In Romansch, the soft ''g'' is a [[voiced palatal plosive]] {{IPA|[ɟ]}} or a voiced [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] affricate {{IPA|[dʑ]}}. :'''H''': [[Silent letter|Silent]] in most languages; used to form various [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. But represents {{IPA|[h]}} in Romanian, Walloon and Gascon Occitan. :'''J''': Represents a fricative in most languages, or the [[palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[j]}} in Romansh and in several of the languages of Italy. Italian does not use this letter in native words. Usually pronounced like the soft ''g'' (except in Romansch and the languages of Italy). :'''Q''': As in Latin, its phonetic value is that of a hard ''c'', and in native words it is always followed by a (sometimes silent) ''u''. Romanian does not use this letter in native words. :'''S''': Generally [[Voice (phonetics)|voiceless]] {{IPA|[s]}}, but voiced {{IPA|[z]}} between vowels in most languages. In Spanish, Romanian, Galician and several varieties of Italian, however, it is always pronounced voiceless. At the end of syllables, it may represent special [[allophone|allophonic]] pronunciations. In Romansh, it also stands for a voiceless or voiced fricative, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} or {{IPA|[ʒ]}}, before certain consonants. :'''W''': No Romance language uses this letter in native words, with the exception of [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. :'''X''': Its pronunciation is rather variable, both between and within languages. In the Middle Ages, the [[Iberian languages|languages of Iberia]] used this letter to denote the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, which is still the case in Modern [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. With the Renaissance the classical pronunciation {{IPA|[ks]}}&nbsp;– or similar [[consonant cluster]]s, such as {{IPA|[ɡz]}}, {{IPA|[ɡs]}}, or {{IPA|[kθ]}}&nbsp;– were frequently reintroduced in [[latinism]]s and hellenisms. In [[Venetian language|Venetian]] it represents {{IPA|[z]}}, and in [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] the [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[ʒ]}}. Italian does not use this letter in native words. :'''Y''': This letter is not used in most languages, with the prominent exceptions of French and Spanish, where it represents {{IPA|[j]}} before vowels (or various similar fricatives such as the [[Voiced palatal fricative|palatal fricative]] {{IPA|[ʝ]}}, in Spanish), and the vowel or [[semivowel]] {{IPA|[i]}} elsewhere. :'''Z''': In most languages it represents the sound {{IPA|[z]}}.  However, in Italian it denotes the affricates {{IPA|[dz]}} and {{IPA|[ts]}} (which are two separate phonemes, but rarely contrast; among the few examples of minimal pairs are ''razza'' "ray" with {{IPA|[ddz]}}, ''razza'' "race" with {{IPA|[tts]}}); in Romansh the voiceless affricate {{IPA|[ts]}}; and in Galician and Spanish it denotes either the [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|[θ]}} or {{IPA|[s]}}.  Otherwise, letters that are not combined as digraphs generally have the same sounds as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), whose design was, in fact, greatly influenced by the Romance spelling systems.  ===Digraphs and trigraphs=== Since most Romance languages have more sounds than can be accommodated in the Roman Latin alphabet they all resort to the use of digraphs and trigraphs&nbsp;– combinations of two or three letters with a single sound value. The concept (but not the actual combinations) is derived from Classical Latin, which used, for example, ''TH'', ''PH'', and ''CH'' when transliterating the Greek letters "θ", "ϕ" (later "φ"), and "χ". These were once [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] sounds in Greek before changing to corresponding fricatives, and the ''H'' represented what sounded to the Romans like an {{IPA|/ʰ/}} following {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} respectively. Some of the digraphs used in modern scripts are:  :'''CI''': used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy and Romanian to represent {{IPA|/tʃ/}} before ''A'', ''O'', or ''U''. :'''CH''': used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Romanian, Romansh and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] to represent {{IPA|/k/}} before ''E'' or ''I''; {{IPA|/tʃ/}} in [[Occitan]], Spanish, Astur-leonese and Galician; {{IPA|[c]}} or {{IPA|[tɕ]}} in Romansh before ''A'', ''O'' or ''U''; and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in most other languages. In Catalan it is used in some old spelling conventions for {{IPA|/k/}}. :'''DD''': used in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] to represent the [[voiced retroflex plosive]] {{IPA|/ɖ/}}. In recent history more accurately transcribed as ''DDH''. :'''DJ''': used in Walloon and Catalan for {{IPA|/dʒ/}}. :'''GI''': used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy and Romanian to represent {{IPA|/dʒ/}} before ''A'', ''O'', or ''U'', and in Romansh to represent {{IPA|[ɟi]}} or {{IPA|/dʑi/}} or (before ''A'', ''E'', ''O'', and ''U'') {{IPA|[ɟ]}} or {{IPA|/dʑ/}} :'''GH''': used in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Romanian, Romansh and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] to represent {{IPA|/ɡ/}} before ''E'' or ''I'', and in Galician for the [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]] {{IPA|/ħ/}} (not standard sound). :'''GL''': used in Romansh before consonants and ''I'' and at the end of words for {{IPA|/ʎ/}}. :'''GLI''': used in Italian and Romansh for {{IPA|/ʎ/}}. :'''GN''': used in French, Italian, Romance languages in Italy and Romansh for {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, as in ''champignon'' or ''gnocchi''. :'''GU''': used before ''E'' or ''I'' to represent {{IPA|/ɡ/}} or {{IPA|/ɣ/}} in all Romance languages except Italian, Romance languages in Italy, Romansh, and Romanian (which use '''GH''' instead). :'''IG''': used at the end of word in Catalan for {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, as in ''maig'', ''safareig'' or ''enmig''. :'''IX''': used between vowels or at the end of word in Catalan for {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, as in ''caixa'' or ''calaix''. :'''LH''': used in Portuguese and Occitan {{IPA|/ʎ/}}. :'''LL''': used in Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Astur-leonese, Norman and Dgèrnésiais, originally for {{IPA|/ʎ/}} which has merged in some cases with {{IPA|/j/}}. Represents {{IPA|/l/}} in French unless it follows ''I'' (''i'') when it represents {{IPA|/j/}} (or {{IPA|/ʎ/}} in some dialects). It is used in Occitan for a [[geminate consonant|long]] {{IPA|/ll/}} :'''L·L''': used in Catalan for a geminate consonant {{IPA|[ɫɫ]}}. :'''NH''': used in Portuguese and Occitan for {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, used in official Galician for {{IPA|/ŋ/}} . :'''N-''': used in Piedmontese and Ligurian for {{IPA|/ŋ/}} between two vowels. :'''NN''': used in [[Leonese language|Leonese]] for {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, :'''NY''': used in Catalan for {{IPA|/ɲ/}}. :'''QU''': represents {{IPA|[kw]}} in Italian, Romance languages in Italy, and Romansh; {{IPA|[k]}} in French, Astur-leonese (normally before ''e'' or ''i''); {{IPA|[k]}} (before ''e'' or ''i'') or {{IPA|[kw]}} (normally before ''a'' or ''o'') in Occitan, Catalan and Portuguese; {{IPA|[k]}} in Spanish (always before ''e'' or ''i''). :'''RR''': used between vowels in several languages (Occitan, Catalan, Spanish...) to denote a [[Trill consonant|trilled]] {{IPA|/r/}} or a [[guttural R]], instead of the [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|/ɾ/}}. :'''SC''': used before ''E'' or ''I'' in Italian and Romance languages in Italy for {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, and in French, Portuguese, Catalan and American Spanish as {{IPA|/s/}} in words of certain etymology (notice this would be {{IPA|/θ/}} in standard peninsular Spanish) :'''SCH''': used in Romansh for {{IPA|[ʃ]}} or {{IPA|[ʒ]}}. :'''SCI''': used in Italian and Romance languages in Italy to represent {{IPA|/ʃ/}} before ''A'', ''O'', or ''U''. :'''SH''': used in Aranese Occitan for {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. :'''SS''': used in French, Portuguese, Piedmontese, Romansh, Occitan, and Catalan for {{IPA|/s/}} between vowels. :'''TS''': used in Catalan for {{IPA|/ts/}}. :'''TG''': used in Romansh for {{IPA|[c]}} or {{IPA|[tɕ]}}. In Catalan is used for {{IPA|/dʒ/}} before ''E'' and ''I'', as in ''metge'' or ''fetge''. :'''TH''': used in Jèrriais for {{IPA|/θ/}}; used in Aranese for either {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/tʃ/}}. :'''TJ''': used between vowels and before ''A'', ''O'' or ''U'', in Catalan for {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, as in ''sotjar'' or ''mitjó''. :'''TSCH''': used in Romansh for {{IPA|[tʃ]}}. :'''TX''': used at the beginning or at the end of word or between vowels in Catalan for {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, as in ''txec'', ''esquitx'' or ''atxa''. :'''TZ''': used in Catalan for {{IPA|/dz/}}.  While the digraphs ''CH'', ''PH'', ''RH'' and ''TH'' were at one time used in many words of Greek origin, most languages have now replaced them with ''C/QU'', ''F'', ''R'' and ''T''. Only French has kept these [[etymology|etymological]] spellings, which now represent {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/ʀ/}} and {{IPA|/t/}}, respectively.  ====Double consonants==== [[Geminate consonant|Gemination]], in the languages where it occurs, is usually indicated by doubling the consonant, except when it does not contrast phonemically with the corresponding short consonant, in which case gemination is not indicated. In [[Jèrriais]], long consonants are marked with an apostrophe: ''S'S'' is a long {{IPA|/zz/}}, ''SS'S'' is a long {{IPA|/ss/}}, and ''T'T'' is a long {{IPA|/tt/}}. Phonemic contrast of geminates vs. single consonants is widespread in [[Italian language|Italian]], and normally indicated in the traditional orthography: ''fatto'' /fatto/ 'done' vs. ''fato'' /fato/ 'fate, destiny'; ''cadde'' /kadde/ 's/he, it fell' vs. ''cade'' /kade/ 's/he, it falls'. The double consonants in French orthography, however, are merely etymological. In Catalan, the gemination of the ''l'' is marked by a ''punt volat'' = ''flying point'' – ''l·l''.  ===Diacritics=== Romance languages also introduced various marks ([[diacritic]]s) that may be attached to some letters, for various purposes. In some cases, diacritics are used as an alternative to digraphs and trigraphs; namely to represent a larger number of sounds than would be possible with the basic alphabet, or to distinguish between sounds that were previously written the same. Diacritics are also used to mark word stress, to indicate exceptional pronunciation of letters in certain words, and to distinguish words with same pronunciation ([[homophone]]s).  Depending on the language, some letter-diacritic combinations may be considered distinct letters, e.g. for the purposes of [[Alphabetical order|lexical sorting]]. This is the case, for example, of Romanian ''{{unicode|ș}}'' ({{IPA|[ʃ]}}) and Spanish ''{{unicode|ñ}}'' ({{IPA|[ɲ]}}).  The following are the most common use of diacritics in Romance languages. * '''Vowel quality''': the system of marking [[close-mid vowel]]s with an [[acute accent]], ''é'', and [[open-mid vowel]]s with a [[grave accent]], ''è'', is widely used (e.g. Catalan, French, Italian). Portuguese, however, uses the [[circumflex]] (''ê'') for the former, and the acute (''é''), for the latter.  Some minority Romance languages use an [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] (diaeresis mark) in the case of ''ä, ö, ü'' to indicate fronted vowel variants, as in [[German language|German]].  Centralized vowels ({{IPA|/ɐ/, /ǝ/}}) are indicated variously (''â'' in Portuguese, ''ă/î'' in Romanian, ''ë'' in [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]], etc.).  In French, Occitan and Romanian, these accents are used whenever necessary to distinguish the appropriate vowel quality, but in the other languages, they are used only when it is necessary to mark unpredictable stress, or in some cases to distinguish homophones. * '''Vowel length''': French uses a circumflex to indicate what was formerly a [[long vowel]] (although nowadays this rather indicates a difference in vowel quality, if it has any effect at all on pronunciation).  This same usage is found in some minority languages. * '''Nasality''': Portuguese marks [[nasal vowel]]s with a [[tilde]] (''ã'') when they occur before other written vowels and in some other instances. * '''Palatalization''': some historical [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]s are indicated with the [[cedilla]] (''ç'') in French, Catalan, Occitan and Portuguese. In Spanish and several other world languages influenced by it, the grapheme ''[[ñ]]'' represents a [[palatal nasal]] consonant. * '''Separate pronunciation''': when a vowel and another letter that would normally be combined into a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] with a single sound are exceptionally pronounced apart, this is often indicated with a [[umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis mark]] on the vowel. This is particularly common in the case of ''gü'' /gw/ before ''e'' or ''i'', because plain ''gu'' in this case would be pronounced /g/. This usage occurs in Spanish, French, Catalan and Occitan, and formerly (prior to the 2009 spelling reform) in Brazilian Portuguese.  French also uses the diaeresis on the second of two adjacent vowels to indicate that both are pronounced separately, as in ''Noël'' "Christmas" and ''haïr'' "to hate". * '''Stress''': the stressed vowel in a polysyllabic word may be indicated with an accent, when it cannot be predicted by rule.  In Italian, Portuguese and Catalan, the choice of accent (acute, grave or circumflex) may depend on vowel quality.  When no quality needs to be indicated, an acute accent is normally used (''ú''), but Italian and Romansh use a grave accent (''ù'').  Portuguese puts a diacritic on all stressed monosyllables that end in ''a e o as es os'', to distinguish them from unstressed function words: ''chá'' "tea", ''más'' "bad (fem. pl.)", ''sé'' "seat (of government)", ''dê'' "give! (imperative)", ''mês'' "month", ''só'' "only", ''nós'' "we" (cf. ''mas'' "but", ''se'' "if/oneself", ''de'' "of", ''nos'' "us"). * '''Homophones''': words (especially monosyllables) that are pronounced exactly or nearly the same way and are spelled identically, but have different meanings, can be differentiated by a diacritic. Typically, if one of the pair is stressed and the other isn't, the stressed word gets the diacritic, using the appropriate diacritic for notating stressed syllables (see above).  Portuguese does this consistently as part of notating stress in certain monosyllables, whether or not there is an unstressed homophone (see examples above).  Spanish also has many pairs of identically pronounced words distinguished by an acute accent on the stressed word: ''si'' "if" vs. ''sí'' "yes", ''mas'' "but" vs. ''más'' "more", ''mi'' "my" vs. ''mí'' "me", ''se'' "oneself" vs. ''sé'' "I know", ''te'' "you (object)" vs. ''té'' "tea", ''que/quien/cuando/como'' "that/who/when/how" vs. ''qué/quién/cuándo/cómo'' "what?/who?/when?/how?", etc.  Catalan has some pairs where both words are stressed, and one is distinguished by a vowel-quality diacritic, e.g. ''os'' "bone" vs. ''ós'' "bear".  When no vowel-quality needs distinguishing, French and Catalan use a [[grave accent]] (which is otherwise unused in the languages): French ''ou'' "or" vs. ''où'' "where", French ''la'' "the" vs. "là'' "there", Catalan ''ma'' "my" vs. ''mà'' "hand".  ===Upper and lower case=== Most languages are written with a mixture of two distinct but phonetically identical variants or "[[Letter case|cases]]" of the alphabet: [[majuscule]] ("uppercase" or "capital letters"), derived from Roman stone-carved letter shapes, and [[Lower case|minuscule]] ("lowercase"), derived from [[Carolingian minuscule|Carolingian writing]] and Medieval [[quill pen]] handwriting which were later adapted by printers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  In particular, all Romance languages presently capitalize (use uppercase for the first letter of) the following words: the first word of each complete [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], most words in names of people, places, and organizations, and most words in titles of books. The Romance languages do not follow the German practice of capitalizing all nouns including common ones. Unlike English, the names of months, days of the weeks, and derivatives of proper nouns are usually not capitalized: thus, in Italian one capitalizes ''Francia'' ("France") and ''Francesco'' ("Francis"), but not ''francese'' ("French") or ''francescano'' ("Franciscan"). However, each language has some exceptions to this general rule.  ==Vocabulary comparison== The tables below provide a vocabulary comparison that illustrates a number of examples of sound shifts that have occurred between Latin and Romance languages, along with a selection of minority languages. Words are given in their conventional spellings. In addition, for French the actual pronunciation is given, due to the dramatic differences between spelling and pronunciation. (French spelling approximately reflects the pronunciation of [[Old French]], c. 1200 AD.)  {|class="wikitable" style="font-size: 85%" |- ![[English language|English]] !width="75"|[[Latin language|Latin]] | rowspan="31" | ![[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]<br>(Nuorese)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ditzionariu.org/home.asp?lang=sar|title=Ditzionàriu Online|accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> ![[Romanian language|Romanian]] ![[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://italian.about.com/od/sicilian/a/aa050405d_3.htm |title=Sicilian–English Dictionary |publisher=Italian.about.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utenti.lycos.it/uerreclan_sito/dizionario.htm |title=Dictionary Sicilian – Italian |publisher=Utenti.lycos.it |date= |accessdate=2010-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zompist.com/euro.htm |title=Indo-European Languages |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref> ![[Italian language|Italian]] ![[Venetian language|Venetian]] ![[Emilian language|Emilian]] ![[Lombard language|Lombard]] ![[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piemonteis.com/ |title=Grand Dissionari Piemontèis / Grande Dizionario Piemontese |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref> ![[Friulian language|Friulian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sangiorgioinsieme.it/Diz-friulan-english%20.htm |title=Dictionary English–Friulian Friulian–English |publisher=Sangiorgioinsieme.it |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31}}</ref> ![[Romansh language|Romansh]] ![[French language|French]] ![[Occitan language|Occitan]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Beaumont |url=http://www.freelang.net/online/occitan.php?lg=gb |title=Occitan–English Dictionary |publisher=Freelang.net |date=2008-12-16 |accessdate=2010-11-06}}</ref> ![[Catalan language|Catalan]] ![[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.glosbe.com/en/an |title=English Aragonese Dictionary Online |publisher=Glosbe |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref> ![[Spanish language|Spanish]] ![[Asturian language|Asturian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.glosbe.com/en/ast |title=English Asturian Dictionary Online |publisher=Glosbe |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref> ![[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] |- |man |''homō, hominem'' |ómine |om |omu |uomo |om(en)o |òm(en) |om(en) |òm |om |um |homme<br>{{IPA|/ɔm/}} |òme |home |om(br)e |hombre |home |homem |- |woman, wife |''mulier, mulierem'' |muzère |muiere |mugghieri |moglie |mojer |mujér |miee/fomna |fomna |muîr |muglier |[[Old French|OF]] moillier |[[Old Occitan|OOc]] mólher ([[nominative case|nom.]]) /<br>molhér ([[objective case|obj.]]) |muller |muller |mujer |muyer |mulher |- |son |''fīlium'' |fìzu |fiu |figghiu |figlio |fiol |fiōl |fiö/bagaj |fieul |fi |figl, fegl |fils {{IPA|/fis/}} |filh |fill |fillo |hijo |fíu |filho |- |water |''aquam'' |àbba |apă |acqua |acqua |acua |aqua |agua/ova/eiva |eva |aghe |aua |eau {{IPA|/o/}} |aiga |aigua |aigua, augua |agua |agua |água |- |fire |''focum'' |fócu |foc |focu |fuoco |fogo |foeugh |fögh |feu |fûc |fieu |feu&nbsp;{{IPA|/fø/}} |fuòc |foc |fuego |fuego |fueu |fogo |- |rain |''pluviam'' |próida |ploaie |chiuvuta<ref>Developed from *''pluviūtam''.</ref> |pioggia |pióva |pioeuva |piöa |pieuva |ploe |plievgia |pluie&nbsp;{{IPA|/plɥi/}} |pluèja |pluja |plebia |lluvia |lluvia |chuva |- |land |''terram'' |tèrra |ţară |terra |terra |tera |tera |tera |tèra |tiere |terra/tiara |terre&nbsp;{{IPA|/tɛʁ/}} |tèrra |terra |tierra |tierra |tierra |terra |- |sky |''caelum'' |chélu |cer |celu |cielo |çiél |cēl |cel/sel |cel |cîl |tschiel |ciel&nbsp;{{IPA|/sjɛl/}} |cèl |cel |zielo |cielo |cielu |céu |- |high |''altum'' |àrtu |înalt |autu |alto |alto |élt |volt/ot |àut |alt |aut |haut<ref>Initial ''h-'' due to contamination of Germanic ''*hauh'' "high".

This is the scheme followed by Ethnologue, and is based primarily on the outcome of the ten monophthong vowels in Classical Latin. This is discussed more below. West vs. East. This scheme divides the various languages along the La Spezia–Rimini Line, which runs across north-central Italy just to the north of the city of Florence (whose speech forms the basis of standard Italian). In this scheme, "East" includes the languages of central and southern Italy, and the Balkan Romance (or "Eastern Romance") languages in Romania, Greece, and elsewhere in the Balkans; "West" includes the languages of Portugal, Spain, France, northern Italy and Switzerland. Sardinian does not easily fit in this scheme. "Conservative" vs. "innovatory". This is a non-genetic division whose precise boundaries are subject to debate. Generally, the Gallo-Romance languages (discussed further below) form the core "innovatory" languages, with standard French generally considered the most innovatory of all, while the languages near the periphery (which include Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Romanian) are "conservative". Sardinian is generally acknowledged the most conservative Romance language, and was also the first language to split off genetically from the rest, possibly as early as the first century BC. Dante famously denigrated the Sardinians for the conservativeness of their speech, remarking that they imitate Latin "like monkeys imitate men"."Sardos etiam, qui non Latii sunt sed Latiis associandi videntur, eiciamus, quoniam soli sine proprio vulgari esse videntur, gramaticam tanquam simie homines imitantes: nam domus nova et dominus meus locuntur." ("Let us ignore the Sardinians, then, who are not Latins but appear to be associated with them, because they alone seem to lack their own common tongue, rather imitating (Latin) grammar as monkeys do men: For they say 'domus nova' and 'dominus meus'.") It is unclear whether this indicates that Sardinian still had a two-case system at the time; modern Sardinian lacks grammatical case. Italo-Western, the largest group, which includes languages such as Catalan, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, and French. Eastern Romance, which includes the Romance languages of Eastern Europe, such as Romanian. Southern Romance, which includes a few languages with particularly archaic features, such as Sardinian and, partially, Corsican. This family is thought to have included the now-vanished Romance languages of Africa (or at least, they appear to have evolved their vowels in the same way). Lenition of intervocalic stops, which happens to the northwest but not to the southeast. Degemination of geminate stops (producing new intervocalic voiceless stops, after the old ones were lenited), which again happens to the northwest but not to the southeast. Deletion of intertonic vowels (between the stressed syllable and either the first or last syllable), again in the northwest but not the southeast. Use of plurals in /s/ in the northwest vs. plurals using vowel change in the southeast. Development of palatalized /k/ before /e,i/ to  in the northwest vs.  in the southeast. Development of , which develops to  >  (sometimes progressing further to ) in the northwest but  in the southeast. The Gallo‒Italic languages have vowel-changing plurals rather than /s/ plurals. The Lombard language in north-central Italy and the Rhaeto-Romance languages have the "southeast" characteristic of  instead of  for palatalized /k/. The Venetian language in northeast Italy and some of the Rhaeto-Romance languages have the "southeast" characteristic of developing  to . Other than the Occitano-Romance languages, most Gallo-Romance languages are subject-obligatory (whereas all the rest of the Romance languages are pro-drop languages). This is a late development triggered by progressive phonetic erosion: Old French was still a null-subject language, and this only changed upon loss of secondarily final consonants in Middle French. Antillean (French Antilles) Haitian Creole (one of Haiti's two official languages) Louisiana (US) Mauritian (lingua franca of Mauritius) Réunion (native language of Réunion) Seychellois (Seychelles' official language) Chavacano (in part of Philippines) Palenquero (in part of Colombia) Cape Verdean (Cape Verde's national language; includes several distinct languages) Upper Guinea (Guinea-Bissau's national language) Angolar (regional language in São Tomé and Príncipe) Forro (regional language in São Tomé and Príncipe) Papiamento (Dutch Antilles official language) Macanese (Macau) Kristang (Malaysia) Romance languages are moderately inflecting, i.e. there is a moderately complex system of affixes (primarily suffixes) that are attached to words to convey grammatical information such as number, gender, person, tense, etc. Verbs have much more inflection than nouns. The amount of synthesis is significantly more than English, but less than Classical Latin and much less than the oldest Indo-European languages (e.g. Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Inflection is fusional, with a single affix representing multiple features (as contrasted with agglutinative languages such as Turkish or Japanese). For example, Portuguese amei "I loved" is composed of am- "love" and the fusional suffix -ei "first person, singular, preterite tense, indicative". Romance languages have a fairly strict subject–verb–object word order, with predominant use of head-first (right-branching) constructions. Adjectives, genitives and relative clauses all follow their head noun, although (except in Romanian) determiners usually precede. In general, nouns, adjectives and determiners inflect only according to grammatical gender (masculine or feminine) and grammatical number (singular or plural). Grammatical case is marked only on pronouns, as in English; case marking, as in English, is of the nominative–accusative type (rather than e.g. the ergative–absolutive marking of Basque or the split ergativity of Hindi). A significant exception, however, is Romanian, with two-case marking (nominative/accusative vs. genitive/dative) on nominal elements. Verbs are inflected according to a complex morphology that marks person, number (singular or plural), tense, mood (indicative, subjunctive, imperative), and sometimes aspect or gender. Grammatical voice (active, passive, middle/reflexive) and some grammatical aspects (in particular, the perfect aspect) are expressed using periphrastic constructions, as in the Italian present perfect (passato prossimo) io ho amato/io sono stato amato "I have loved/I have been loved". Most Romance languages are null subject languages (but modern French is not, as a result of the phonetic decay of verb endings). All Romance languages have two articles (definite and indefinite), and many have in addition a partitive article (expressing the concept of "some"). In some languages (notably, French), the use of an article with a noun is nearly obligatory; it serves to express grammatical number (no longer marked on most nouns) and to cope with the extreme homophony of French vocabulary as a result of extensive sound reductions. The phonology of most Romance languages is of moderate size with few unusual phonemes. Phonemic vowel length is uncommon. Some languages have developed nasal vowels or front rounded vowels. Word accent is of the stress (dynamic) type, rather than making use of pitch (as in Ancient Greek and some modern Slavic languages), and is free, occurring more or less unpredictably on one of the last three syllables. In practice, the stress is largely predictable, due to the many morphological and phonological stress-related patterns. Loss of phonemic vowel length, and change into a free-stressed language. Classical Latin had an automatically determined stress on the second or third syllable from the end, conditioned by vowel length; once vowel length was neutralized, stress was no longer predictable so long as it remained where it was (which it mostly did). Development of a series of palatal consonants as a result of palatalization. Loss of most traces of the neuter gender. Development of a series of analytic perfect tenses, comparable to English "I have done, I had done, I will have done". Loss of the Latin synthetic passive voice, replaced by an analytic construction comparable to English "it is/was done". Loss of deponent verbs, replaced by active-voice verbs. Replacement of the Latin future tense with a new tense formed (usually) by a periphrasis of infinitive + present tense of habēre "have", which usually contracts into a new synthetic tense. A corresponding conditional tense is formed in the same way but using one of the past-tense forms of habēre. Numerous lexical changes. A number of words were borrowed from the Germanic languages and Celtic languages. Many basic nouns and verbs, especially those that were short or had irregular morphology, were replaced by longer derived forms with regular morphology. Throughout the medieval period, words were borrowed from Classical Latin in their original form (learned words) or in something approaching the original form (semi-learned words), often replacing the popular forms of the same words. Most languages have at least five monophthongs .  The parent language of most of the Italo-Western Romance languages (which includes the vast majority) actually had a seven-vowel system , which is kept in most Italo-Western languages. In some languages, like Spanish and Romanian, the phonemic status and difference between open-mid and close-mid vowels was lost. French has probably the largest inventory of monophthongs, with conservative varieties having 12 oral vowels  can occur only in unstressed syllables, and it tends to be rounded ; it is replaced by  when stressed. and 4 nasal vowels . European Portuguese also has a large inventory, with 9 oral monophthongs , 5 nasal monophthongs , and a large number of oral and nasal diphthongs (see below). (The phonemic status of  is somewhat doubtful, however, and neither phoneme exists in Brazilian Portuguese). developed as the allophone of  before nasals and under low stress, and the two are still nearly in complementary distribution.  A few minimal pairs like falamos  "we speak" vs. falámos  "we spoke" seem to clearly indicate that  must be a phoneme, but other analyses are possible.  , which developed from earlier  in unstressed syllables, is even more doubtful. Some languages have a large inventory of falling diphthongs. These may or may not be considered as phonemic units (rather than sequences of vowel+glide), depending on their behavior. As an example, French, Spanish and Italian have occasional instances of putative falling diphthongs formed from a vowel plus a non-syllabic  or  (e.g. Spanish veinte  "twenty", deuda  "debt"; French paille  "straw", caoutchouc  "rubber"; Italian lui  "he", potei  "I could"), but these are normally analyzed as sequences of vowel and glide. The diphthongs in Romanian, Portuguese, Catalan and Occitan, however, have various properties suggesting that they are better analyzed as unit phonemes. Portuguese, for example, has the diphthongs , where  (and to a lesser extent ) appear only in some dialects. All except  appear frequently in verb or noun inflections. (Portuguese also has nasal diphthongs; see below.) Among the major Romance languages, Portuguese and French have nasal vowel phonemes, stemming from nasalization before a nasal consonant followed by loss of the consonant (this occurred especially when the nasal consonant was not directly followed by a vowel). Originally, vowels in both languages were nasalized before all nasal consonants, but have subsequently become denasalized before nasal consonants that still remain (except in Brazilian Portuguese, where the pre-nasal vowels in words such as cama "bed", menos "less" remain highly nasalized). In Portuguese, nasal vowels are sometimes analyzed as phonemic sequences of oral vowels plus an underlying nasal consonant, but such an analysis is difficult in French because of the existence of minimal pairs such as bon  "good (masc.)", bonne  "good (fem.)". In both languages, there are fewer nasal than oral vowels. Nasalization triggered vowel lowering in French, producing the 4 nasal vowels  (although most speakers nowadays pronounce  as ). Vowel raising was triggered in Portuguese, however, producing the 5 nasal vowels . Vowel contraction and other changes also resulted in the Portuguese nasal diphthongs  (of which  occurs in only two words, muito  "much, many, very", and mui  "very",  and  are actually final-syllable allophones of ). Most languages have fewer vowels in unstressed syllables than stressed syllables. This again reflects the Italo-Western Romance parent language, which had a seven-vowel system in stressed syllables (as described above) but only  (with no low-mid vowels) in unstressed syllables. Some languages have seen further reductions: e.g. Standard Catalan has only  in unstressed syllables. In French, on the other hand, any vowel may take prosodic stress. Most languages have even fewer vowels in word-final unstressed syllables than elsewhere. For example, Old Italian allowed only , while the early stages of most Western Romance languages allowed only . The Gallo-Romance languages went even farther, deleting all final vowels except . Of these languages, French has carried things to the extreme by deleting all vowels after the accented syllable and uniformly accenting the final syllable (except for a more-or-less non-phonemic final unstressed  that occasionally appears). Modern Spanish now allows final unstressed , and modern Italian allows final unstressed , but they tend to occur largely in borrowed or onomatopoeic words, e.g. guru "guru", taxi "taxi", Spanish tribu "tribe" and espíritu "spirit" (loanwords from Classical Latin), Italian babau "bogeyman" (onomatopoeic, cf. English "boo!"). The apparent Spanish exception casi "almost" originates from Latin quasi "as if"
